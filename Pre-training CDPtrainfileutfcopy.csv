"Combined with the reality of corporate carbon emissions and climate risks and opportunities, the company carries out detailed management of energy use, controls the power consumption of high-energy consuming equipment such as air conditioning, makes daily inspections to turn off unnecessary power supplies, and invests more resources to support the use of renewable energy.In 2020, the company purchased the green power produced by the Datan Wind Farm (48MW) project in Qinhuangdao City and Guanhu Wind Farm (49.8 MW) Phase II project in Chaohu City to offset carbon emissions while supporting domestic renewable energy production."
"As a science-based company, 3M uses the World Resources Institute (WRI)/World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard to set GHG emission reduction targets. For this reason, we acted on the findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C to set our goals and actions.  We've remained committed to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) since 2005. Even though we have seen global emissions decrease temporarily as a result of the unprecedented global COVID-19 pandemic, climate change remains an existential threat. Its impacts are widespread, and its risks are not limited by continent, industry, or even species. Our Strategic Sustainability Framework directs our efforts to areas where we can make the biggest impact. Within the Science for Climate pillar of this framework, we will continue to focus on innovating to decarbonize industry, accelerating global climate solutions, and improving our environmental footprint. We'll continue to drive climate solutions in our operations, in our products, and in communities around the world. We will use the IPCC AR6 Climate Change 2021: The Physical Science Basis Report to inform our climate strategy. In 2015, 3M set a goal to ensure GHG emissions are at least 50% below our 2002 baseline by 2025. 3M's new commitment (announced in 2021) is to reduce Scope 1 and 2 market-based GHG emissions from our 2019 baseline by at least 50% by 2030, 80% by 2040, and be 100% carbon neutral in our operations by 2050. This is a stepped goal. The table above indicates the target for the first step."
"Progress against target has been achieved through a combination of internal initiatives and through the improved CO2 conversion factors as the network becomes more efficient. The reduction does not take into account the move to 100% electricity from renewable sources which was enacted in May 2020. We are in the process of developing science-based targets for our scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions that we aim to submit to the SBTi for approval in the automn of 2021."
"The target covers our whole operated container vessel fleet of about 700 ships. To date we have made significant improvements of 41.8% on relative emissions against our 2008 baseline, however as our fleet has grown since 2008, our absolute emissions have also grown. Therefore we witness, that growth while coupled with our efficiency savings cannot deliver on reducing absolute emissions.  To decarbonise the maritime sector, massive innovation needs to occur over the next 5-10 years.  It is because of this that we have announced our zero net carbon emissions target by 2050, so as to initiate decarbonisation evolution with the maritime sector."
"In 2015, we set ourselves the target of saving 100 percent of the CO2 emissions resulting from the consumption of conventional electricity by 2020. For this reason, in addition to our main locations in Wiesbaden and Mainz, we source environmentally friendly green electricity from hydropower at almost all german locations. The reference amount of 3,249 t CO2e is based on the scope of the Group-wide environmental indicators used in 2013 and includes all electricity consumptions in Germany. In order to ensure comparability of the values, the emission values last calculated for 2019 according to the identical location structure for 2015 were calculated. The survey therefore doesn't cover any international locations. These will be considered in a target which is currently under development.Due to active M&A  and increasing number of new small offices (and existing contracts with energy providers), we have decided to extend 2020 target to 2022. By the end of the reporting year, more than 98% green electricity had already been purchased at german sites, which is very close to the target of 100%. We envisage to extend green electricity purchasing to our international sites."
"In 2020, ABB divested its Power Grids business (PG) to Hitachi. In order to measure our progress properly, we have re-baselined our 2020 target by removing the contribution from our divested Power Grids business to the 2013 baseline (the baseline was reduced from 1,551 kilotons to 1,167 kilotons). We have also excluded the emissions of the 39 newly acquired sites (GEIS) added in 2019, for which no 2013 baseline data exists. This shows we have achieved a 58 percent reduction of our Scope 1+2 emissions from 2013.In 2018 we acquired the business ""GEIS"" and integrated these sites into our sustainability reporting in 2019. Since we don't have any 2013 baseline data for these 39 sites, we do not count it towards our progress towards our 2020 targets. ABB's total scope 1+2 emissions in 2020 amounted to 561 kilotons, without GEIS they were 487 kiloton.If we would have swallowed this acquisition and included the GEIS emissions while not being able to adjust the 2013 baseline upwards, we would still have over-achieved our 2020 target and reached 129% of the target. This scope 1 and 2 target was ambitious enough to be a science-based target, but we did not send it to the SBT Initiative for approval. Instead, this year we submitted ambitious targets for 2030 that were approved by the SBTi in May 2021."
"ABB launched this climate change target as part of its Sustainability Strategy 2030 in November 2020. The target has since been submitted and approved as a Science Based Target to the 1.5 degree C trajectory. ABB also committed to be carbon neutral in Scope 1+2 by 2020. After reducing as much as we can of our Scope 1+2 emissions through energy efficiency measures and other efforts in own operations (>80 percent), we will compensate for the remaining emissions through credible offsets when we approach 2030. This year, we have joined the Business Ambition for 1.5°C initiative and thus committed to achieve net-zero emissions across our value chain no later than 2050."
"ABB's science-based targets have been deemed to be in conformance with the SBTi Criteria and Recommendations (version 4.1). The SBTi's Target Validation Team has classified ABB's scope 1 and 2 target ambition and has determined that it is in line with a 1.5°C trajectory. This year, we have joined the Business Ambition for 1.5°C initiative and thus committed to achieve net-zero emissions across our value chain no later than 2050."
"TARGET: Reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 CO2e emissions by 30% on an absolute basis compared with our 2018 baseline, which aligns with the objectives of the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) of well below the two-degree Celsius warming scenario.Our Sustainability Plan establishes new 2030 goals for protecting a healthy environment, which will further build on our progress in these priority areas.  Abbott has set absolute-reduction targets, that are science-aligned, for its 2030 goal. Procuring more renewable energy, emission credits and low-emission energy through US and European Virtual Power Purchase Agreements (VPPA) is a key strategy in reducing our CO2 emissions helping us meet our 2030 target.  To support our efforts to continually reduce CO2 emissions, beginning in 2016 we significantly expanded our use of renewable energy in our electricity contracts. To account for the lower emissions resulting from these contracts, we use the GHGP Scope 2 market-based methodology to report our progress on our 2030 carbon goal."
"In 2016 AbbVie decided to take a leadership approach to climate change by setting new aggressive targets to reduce emissions.  Our GHG reduction target is to reduce emissions 25% absolute, by 2025 with a 2015 baseline.  All GHG targets are combined scope 1 and 2 market based.  All quantities reported in this section are in Metric Tons of CO2e.  It should be noted that the CO2e emissions associated with the acquisition of Stemcentrx and Pharmacyclics as well as a new R&D center in Cambridge, MA are not included in the target calculation because they were not included in the 2015 baseline.  The CO2 emissions from these three businesses account for less than 1% of the total AbbVie CO2e emissions. In early 2020 AbbVie initiated the process of setting a science-based carbon target.  We submitted a letter of commitment to SBTi in June of 2021, and we anticipate setting a science-based target in 2022."

"This is a global target which is included in the Corporate Social Sustainability Strategic Plan 2019-2023. It is focused on the reduction of the absolute emissions from scope 1 and 2 of Abengoa's GHG Inventory in a 5% using the base of 2017. With this target, Abengoa expects to reduce an accumulated amount of 103532 tCO2eq by the year 2023. The target has been achieved, due to the fact that Abengoa has reduced around 286700 tCO2 in the first two years, more than 100% of the whole target. Two consideratios: 1) A3T plant emissions are excluded from the analysis, since it is out of the perimeter since Dec 2020 ans 2) emissions from bioethanol process (biomass emissions), are incorporated in Abengoa's scope 1 figure. The target Abs1 is going to be reconfigured prior the end of 2021, in order to be more ambitious in terms of emission reductions. It has not been carried out yet because the organization is under a heavy restructuring process and the perimeter can change significantly. This absolute target is directly connected to the intensity target ‘Int1'."
"This target has been created in 2020, since Abengoa's Abs2 reported in CDP last year was not enough ambitious. This is a target focused on supplies emissions, which is the company's most significant emission source in scope 3. It consists of the reduction of the emissions from this source in 35% in absolute terms. With this target, Abengoa intends to emit at the end of 2025 81146 tCO2 less than in 2019. In order to achieve it, the next actions are being carried out by: 1) Encouragement of the use of local suppliers: in order to reduce the emissions from the supplies transportation (e.g. Abengoa O&M subsidiaries, Abengoa Energy and Abengoa Water). 2) Give support for the carbon footprint reduction of the significant suppliers: through training actions and supporting meetings (e.g. Abengoa corporate). - Efficient use of resources: by awareness activities for the subsidiaries staff (Abengoa's corporate sites in Seville and Madrid). The target is progressing positively, since Abengoa has reduced around 64917 tCO2eq in the first year, the 80% of the whole target. Nevertheless, it is necessary to keep working hard on the target's achievement, as there may be business circumstances that make these emissions rise."
"This target has been created in 2020, since Abengoa's Abs3 reported in CDP last year was not enough ambitious. This is a global target which is focused on the reduction of the absolute emissions from scope 3 downstream emissions in a 17% using the base of 2019. With this target, Abengoa expects to reduce an accumulated amount of 13843 tCO2eq by the year 2023. The target is progressing positively, since Abengoa has reduced around 12214 tCO2eq in the first year, the 87% of the whole target. Nevertheless, it is necessary to keep working hard on the target's achievement, as there may be business circumstances that make these emissions rise."
"This target was defined in the CSR Master Plan 2016-2020, but the deadline for the development of the Plan was extended to 2021. During this year, the company intends to assess the degree of achievement of each objectives of the CSR Master Plan, and the result of this assessment will provide data for the development of new objectives related to climate change and company activities.Although this objective had already been achieved in 2019, due to the improvement of the data collection systems for liquid fuels related to subcontractors, the consumption and GHG emissions in 2020 of scope 1 have increased greatly compared to the last year. For this reason, the objective returns to the underway phase.Abertis is working on calculating the GHG emissions of all the scope 3 categories in order to define a target aligned with the SBTi during the summer of 2021."
"This target was defined in the CSR Master Plan 2016-2020, but the deadline for the development of the Plan was extended to 2021.

"During the 2020 fiscal year and after sharing this as part of our environmental roadmap with the top management and the Board committee that oversees sustainability, we have engaged an external consulting company to support us on setting Science Based Targets to renew our carbon reduction targets. We selected 2019 as a base year because due to the pandemics we considered that 2020 wasn't a representative year as a significant portion of our staff and management team members were working remotely. This target covers  Scope 1 (gas consumption and company's fleet) 46,076 tCO2e + Scope 2 (purchased electricity) 6,456 tCO2e and scope 3 (business travel) 40,642 tCO2e. + significant decrease of our emissions correspond to a reduction in electricity consumption usage and on business travel related to the pandemics"
"ABS 3 target for scope 1 only includes the Netherlands as a region. No data is available for other regions.This scope 1 only includes Lease Car Emissions in the Netherlands. We  set our target for a reduction of 43% compared to the base year 2013. From 20,090 Ton CO2 to 5,540 Ton CO2 in 2020 is a reduction of 72% and we have thus  achieved our Abs 3 target.

"Year-on-Year, we target to reduce the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions across the facilities of Aboitiz Group, and it is measured by carbon productivity (computed as Operating revenues / Direct emissions)."
"This target is for all our operational emissions Scope 1 and 2 emissions globally and Scope 3 (covering transmission and distribution, business travel and home working emissions) and location based emissions."
"In 2019, we developed our 2030 Environmental Action Plan, which provides for the long-term reduction of our environmental impact based on a new set of targets that include, carbon emissions, energy, water, waste, paper, renewable energy, travel, green certification and carbon offsets. Our energy and carbon footprint baselines, which include all energy types, were externally verified and assured according to ISAE 3410 in the Assurance Engagements on Greenhouse Gas Statement."
"Abt has set a goal to decarbonize by 2050, with an interim 25% reduction target by 2021 compared to our 2012 base year. The scope of this absolute emissions reduction target includes Scope 1, Scope 2 (location-based), and Scope 3 (upstream) from our U.S.-based operations. Abt Associates was able to achieve our interim absolute reduction target in 2017. Emissions from 2012-2018 have been externally verified to a reasonable level of assurance for Scope 1 and 2, and limited assurance for Scope 3 emissions. Emissions from 2019 and 2020 will be externally verified during the 2021 calendar year, as per our biennial verification cycle. To date, Abt has achieved a 71.7% emissions reduction. In 2020, we expanded our inventory to include emissions sources from telecommuting as this became material during COVID-19, accounting for 17% of our total 2020 emissions.Having met and exceeded the initial emission reduction target, in 2020 Abt developed our new target for 2025 (Abt's fiscal year 2026, Q3), aligned with our next five-year strategy. This updated target is aligned with the latest climate science to meet the goal of the Paris Agreement—to limit global warming well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and pursue efforts to limit warming to 1.5°C. Finally, we plan to seek verification with the Science Based Target Initiative (SBTi). Abt's new target is to reduce our global emissions by 33% compared to 2019 levels – our new base year. This target has an expanded scope that includes Abt Australia and Abt Britain operations, and expanded emission sources (i.e., telecommuting and project site offices) to follow best practices and capture the true extent of Abt's carbon footprint. Abt used the Absolute Contraction Approach methodology, defined in terms of an overall reduction in the amount of emissions emitted into the atmosphere by the target year (2050) relative to the base year, to set the minimum threshold of our intended reduction target. Abt's new 2019 base year reflects our pre-pandemic actions globally. As Abt completes verification of our global emissions inventory for 2019 and 2020, we will include these updated values and scopes as part of our response to the CDP for the 2022 reporting cycle."

"This is a rolling planning target, with annual emissions reduced by 2% compared to the previous year.In 2020, greenhouse gas emissions will increase by 1746.7 tCO2e, an increase of 4.7% compared with 2019. The main reason for the increase is the expansion of the scope included in the inventory in 2020. The Qiyan and Philippine Plant are included in the statistics in 2020, which were not included in 2019, and these 2 plants accounts for the increase of 15.5% of emissions. But if we consistent with the 2019 scope (Tamsui Plant, Dongguan Plant, Wuhan Plant) the emission is 33,138.10 tCO2e in 2020, a decrease of 3991.82 tCO2e which is 10.8% from 2019"
"Compared with the 2014 base year, we reduced emission by 9563.5 tCO2e, with a reduction rate of 19.7%. The scope included in the statistics in 2020 include Tamsui Plant, Dongguan Plant, Wuhan Plant, Qiyan, Philippine Plant."
"By 2025, we aim to reduce our absolute greenhouse gas emissions by 11%, our scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 65% and scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions per unit of revenue intensity by 40%.

"Accurate has removed some of our operating machinery which consumes a tremendous amount of electricity and we replaced it with more efficient machines.  With the more efficient machines, we do not need to run them for the same amount of hours as previous.  We also installed a PV array on the roof in Q3 of 2019 which has helped us get close. We are looking to expand the PV array on our roof to further offset purchased electricity."
"The reduction in energy consumption, at year 2024, will be reached thanks to several targets to be met: within water sector, environment sector, and electricity distribution sector. All sectors in fact have specific targets. In particular. Areti,(the Company that distributes electricity): as previous years, various interventions have been carried out in 2020 and are expected before year 2024: i) reduction of physical losses in the distribution network due to change in HV (from 60 kV to 150 kV), MV (from 8.4 kV to 20 kV), LV (from 231 V to 400 V); ii) new transformer installation - MV/LV transformers with very low losses; variation in the MV network configuration.  In various Group other also efficiency measures will be carried out.  Moreover, the reduction of Scope 2 emissions include installation of LED lighting systems of the Rome public lighting grid. Moreover, the Water company Acea Ato 2's Energy Efficiency Plan has a target of 12 GWh to 2024 considering water pumping system and other measures within the Integrated Water System. This target will be achieved through several activities of water leakage research and pressure management. Also Acea Ato 5 and AdF have planned efficiency measures. During 2020 some of these activities have been already completed.Moreover, Acea will try to formalize a Group SBT by engaging the companies for which this is feasible. Alternatively, it will in any case formalize a Group Target."
"In year 2016 Acea started elaborating a new strategy concerning a portion of the electricity consumed: main companies could certify the electricity consumed in the year as ''G.O.” (a garanzia d'origine=certificates of guarantees of origin). In 2017, 2018 and 2019  main companies already managed to use such certificates, that confirm the electricity origins from renewable sources, buying these certificates from Acea Energia. In year 2020, again main Companies consumed G.O. electricity: the Company Acea Energia sold G.O. energy to the main companies of the Group, meeting the target for the fourth year."

The target is 80% reduction in 2020 to meet 6,428 ton CO2e emissions.(4). % of target achieved = (32144 - 12199)*100%/(32144-6428) = 77.6%(5) % of time = (2020 - 2009)/(2050 - 2009) = 26.8%"
"As part of the stainless steel industry sector, Acerinox is aligned with the Paris Agreement to limit global warming by undertaking ambitious efforts to combat climate change and adapt to its effects.  The Paris Agreement works on a 5- year cycle of increasingly ambitious climate action carried out by countries.  Accordingly, we have ratified our commitment to achieving carbon neutrality as a long term goal (2050) with intermediate steps such as 20% CO2 reduction by 2030.  Digital transformation, electrification o boost transport and industrial processes in an effort to reduce emissions, adopt alternative energies and increase efficiency and hydrogen support are the main channels through which Acerinox will descarbonise its value chain. Collaboration with the various social players will be key to overcoming possible difficulties in achieving this aim, such as the cost of CO2 and the new market's restrictions that Acerinox will widthstand, the price of renewable electrictricity and hydrogen's feasiblity. In 2020,  Acerinox  Europe signed 1,031,012 MWh of guaranteed origin of power installations from renweable sources for 10 years.  These emissions reported include VDM scope 1+2 (136,640 tCO2e) from March 2020, date of acquisition, until the end of the reporting year. It must be highlighted that VDM's emissions represent a 5% of the total covered emissions in the reporting year . Nevertheless, due to its recent integrarion verification was not carried out , but it is planned to be part of the scope verification for 2021"
"Minimizing our absolute emissions comes on top of ACIP's sustainability goals. To achieve this goal we have set ourselves targets to increase reliance on renewable energy by 33% by the end of 2025.To achieve the target we have dedicated all our available roof space to construct a 1 MW photovoltaic power generation plant. Simulation software has projected that the plant's average annual power output would be 1,690,000 kWh, covering 33% of ACIP's power consumption. The sustainability department has proposed the aspired project and received several offers from tenderers willing to build, own and operate the plant. ACIP's management is on the verge of signing a 25 year power purchasing agreement with one of three shortlisted companies to execute the project. The project is expected to be completed and operational by 2025."
"We plan to increase our energy efficiency up to 10% by the end of 2035 compared to the base year 2020. Building up on the 2025 target to increase reliance on renewable energy by 33%, increasing the energy efficiency is planned to reduce ACIP's overall Scope 1&2 emissions by 40% by 2038 compared to the base year 2020.To achieve the energy efficiency target, we are gradually replacing our existent lighting systems by modern energy saving LED lights. Additionally, compressed air conservation is being applied via reduced pressure operation and leakage detection among other compressor efficiency measures, which reduced the compressors' energy consumption significantly. Finally, there is a plan to gradually replace hydraulic machinery with modern, energy efficient all-electric machinery when they reach the end of their service life. Hydraulic machinery is expected to be phased out completely by 2038.Because all of ACIP's offices are at the same location as the factory, the target coverage is considered company wide."
"For our first -ever emissions reduction targets, we challenged all of our facilities to lower their energy consumption by 15% in a single year (by 2020), and 25% in 3 years (by 2022).  Several planned energy reduction initiatives were delayed during the Covid-19 pandemic.  We saw a 5.7% YOY reduction in energy consumption against our 15% target."

"Absolute scope 1 emissions have decreased year on year by 42%, and are 49% lower compared to the baseline. While a number of reduction measures have been put in place across our operations, we can't disregard the significant but singular effects of Covid-19 and corresponding office closures, working from home requirements and business travel restrictions on our carbon footprint. In 2020, we have committed to new emission reduction targets for 2030 with 2018 as the base year, retiring the targets set in 2012 until 2022. This followed a change in how we calculate our emissions data and close data gaps in 2019 (for 2018 data), to a methodology that is more stringent and conservative than in previous years particularly as compared to the calculation of the original 2012 baseline, thus significantly increasing the quality, comprehensiveness and representativeness of data. The target covers all operations of the Adecco Group under its immediate control as reported in the 2020 Annual Report.

"Coverage Explanation:The sites included in this reporting year covered 97% of our employees (excluding retail employees). Sites are located all over the world and are chosen to be part of reporting based on a criteria of size (both in square meters and employees) and type (for example distribution centers). In 2020 our reporting boundary (Green Company Scope) doesn't include Own Retail for Scope 1 and 2.The base year covered 75% of the employees and increased every year. For example, in 2018 we covered 90%. In the baseline year, 15 of our key locations reported data into our data system. This scope has been expanded each year to include as well smaller locations. In 2020, 104 locations are in the reporting scope, so all offices, production sites and distribution centers that adidas operates are included the system. For reporting purposes, multiple buildings are combined into one site. Some adidas employees work in shared offices or in space provided by our suppliers. Adidas has no control over this data and these spaces are therefore not part of the data collection. I.e. sites smaller than 1000sqm and 50sqm do not have a relevant impact on the total consumption of adidas.Green Company Report:  https://www.adidas-group.com/media/filer_public/f8/10/f8105750-28cb-4a13-9e2c-7031785b2c92/adidas_gcr_2020_en.pdfScience Based Target Explanation:In 2015, adidas set an annual absolute net emission reduction target of 3 % for combined Scope 1 and 2, which aggregates to 15% until 2020. In 2020, adidas achieved a reduction of 55% in combined Scope 1 and 2 emissions. The big increase in savings was the implementation  of RECs in our key locations in North America and Europe."
"The covered emissions in base year describe the Scope 1+2 GHG emissions inventory (excluding 3% emissions from facilities smaller than 2,000 sqm as they do not contribute significantly to overall adidas emissions) as stated by adidas in its absolute Scope 1+2 Science Based Target. adidas will begin reporting its  Scope 1+2 Science Based Target emission reduction progress in the next reporting year."
"The covered emissions in base year describe the Scope 3 GHG emissions inventory that are in the scope of the target  (excludes approximately 8% of Scope 3 emissions which are the following categories:  fuel and energy related activities, waste generated in operations, employee commuting, use of sold products, and franchises) as stated by adidas in its absolute Scope 3 Science Based Target. adidas will begin reporting its Scope 3 Science Based Target emission reduction progress in the next reporting year."
"Each production plant has a plan to achieve their targets each year.They are different from each other and are having a effect on the volumes of pieces which are demanded.How more parts are requested, the more energy is required to achief the requested volume.And they way around, when less volumes will be used, the lower the used energy is requiredFor the year 2020 we had less production due to Corona and chip shortage, which gave us a more global save in energy use"
This target covers 100% of scope 1 and 2 emissions arising from our workplaces and managed data centers.  Primary emissions sources include stationary combustion of natural gas and diesel and purchased electricity.  We are targeting a 35% reduction in emissions by FY2025 compared with FY2018.
"This target covers business travel, with the primary contributor being air travel.  We are targeting a 30% reduction in emissions by FY2025 compared with FY2018.  COVID19 pandemic related travel restrictions resulting in a very significant reduction in business travel in the reporting year."
"We updated our target ambition of Scope 2  from 2°C to 1.5°C in order to comply with the most recent climate science. It was officially approved in 2020. The target covers complete Scope 2 and has runtime of 16 years, therefore 67% absolute (16x4.2%).Originally,  our Scope 2  target, compatible with the former global target of a maximum global warming of 2°C, was set in 2017 and officially approved by SBTi in March 2019.  In 2020, we tightened our Scope 2 target to ensure it is compatible with the new global target of a maximum global warming of 1.5 °C. The base year and the target year were retained as before."
"We updated our Scope 1 target  from 2.0°C to 1.5°C pathway  in 2020. The target covers ~79% of total Scope 1 emissions (Natural gas + car fleet) and refers to the car fleet. It aims at 67% reduction over 16 years runtime (16x4.2%).Originally,  our Scope 2  target, compatible with the former global target of a maximum global warming of 2°C, was set in 2017 and officially approved by SBTi in March 2019.

"Refers to sold-product use-phase emissions, which cover 80% of our total Scope 3 emissions. All emissions (100%) of the sold-product use-phase are covered. This target was submitted in 2017 and approved by SBTi in 2019.It was part of our original 2°C target. It was kept when improving  to 1.5°C targets. The target itself may not be aligned with neither new 2°C nor 1.5°C definitions. However, it has to counteract very strong ICT throughput growth (and therefore is a small but absolute target). In total, these emissions are also massively over compensated by the Greening-by-ICT climate-change mitigation potential."
"We have set this YoY target based on our historical performance in reducing emissions from our direct operations on a yearly basis. In our first iteration of this year on year target, CY2018 was our baseline GHG Inventory year."

"AE has set a goal to reduce its Scope 2, location-based emissions by 2.5% from the base year of 2014 in terms of absolute CO2 and CO2 equivalent greenhouse gas emissions. AE has achieved and is on track to exceed this goal. In order to reach the 2.5% reduction, absolute Scope 2 CO2e emissions needed to be reduced by 1,807 metric tonnes. From 2014 to 2020 there was a decrease of 42,083 metric tonnes, resulting in a 58% absolute reduction from the base year."
"In 2020, performance against our 20% GHG reduction goal by 2020 for scope 1 and 2 emissions was a 38% reduction from the 2014 goal baseline. We have reduced energy use by 17 percent since 2014. In 2020, AMD sourced 34 million kwh in renewable energy certificates (RECs) in the U.S. (Green-E certified wind) and China (iRECs wind) which represented 28% of global energy use, enough to power approximately 4,420 homes in the U.S. for a year (based on EPA's Greenhouse Gas Equivalency calculator)AMD is announcing a new SBT for operations in August 2021."

Baselines were determined by analysing data over the period 2017 to 2019.The target has not yet been achieved, but continues to be pursued. We are working towards achieving the target by implementing a number of emission reduction projects.The target is not a science-based target. However, we will consider science-based targeting as we look to setting targets for 2030."
"This is applicable to the Scope 2 emissions (location-based) of all our operations. The target is a reduction of 8% by 2025. Baselines were determined by analysing data over the period 2017 to 2019.Although we achieved the target in 2020, the absolute target that needs to be achieved by 2025 is still being pursued. We acknowledge that some of the reduction in electricity consumption in 2020 was because of the impact of COVID-19 on operational activities and not only energy efficiency initiatives. As such, we will continue to implement energy efficiency projects to ensure that the target is realised in 2025.The target is not a science-based target. However, we will consider science-based targeting as we look to setting targets for 2030."
"In early 2021, Aegon UK publicly committed to achieving net zero carbon emissions in their default solutions by 2050 with the aim of exploring the feasibility of reducing them by half by 2030.

"Airports have great potential for implementing renewable energy, due to their unique conditions and infrastructure. Thus, the challenge is to integrate the renewable energy systems that are increasingly important in energy provision. As part of the new Climate change strategy, Aena has set as an objective the achievement of 100% renewable energy use for its electricity consumption by 2030. Which will come either from self-generation sources or from Guarantees of Origin, with the ultimate aim of achieving carbon neutrality for its main airports and an overall use of 100% renewable energy."
"Released and adopted mid-2019, and revised in 2020, in an effort to align with the objectives set by the Paris Agreement, ACI, of which Aena is a member, has committed to achieve net zero carbon emissions from airport operations fully within their own control (Scope 1 and 2) by 2040 at the latest, reducing absolute emissions to the furthest extent possible and addressing any remaining emissions through investment in carbon removal and storage."
The target is set to be achieved by the end of 2022.
Planned target for fuel consumption and emission is fixed for the year. In the end of this year fact fuel consumption is compared with planned fuel consumption. The fact indicator is not exceeded the planned indicator.
"The company has assumed the goal of neutralizing its emissions by 2025 and making them positive by 2030. For the purposes of completing the CDP, and due to the format restrictions of question 4.1a, AES Brasil identified a reduction target of 100% in relation to the base year. However, it is worth clarifying that the target assumed by the company covers the neutralization of 100% of emissions by 2025, which may combine emission reduction strategies and compensation through the purchase of carbon credits.In 2020, the company has already neutralized its emissions for the period (845.97 tCO2e) through the purchase of carbon credits from a forest preservation project with the Friends of the Climate initiative. Therefore, for calculation purposes in this CDP questionnaire form, the value of 0 tCO2e in the year was inserted (achievement of 100% of the goal).All emissions figures presented here in the CDP consider the consolidated metric tons of CO2e of AES Brasil Energia S.A. and all subsidiaries. In the GHG Protocol public tool, until 2019, emissions were presented separately by company."
AMG has achieved our reduction target through decreased usage directly resulting from enhancements to our energy efficiency.
"This target is inclusive of Scope 1 and 2 emissions from Aflac Japan and Scope 2 emissions from US operations. The target was updated most recently by a pledge from Aflac US in 2020 to further reduce its Scope 2 emissions to increase the targeted base reduction from 71.5 to 75. Aflac, Incorporated became carbon neutral in 2020 for Scopes 1 and 2 by reducing emissions and by purchasing renewable energy credits and carbon offsets. We anticipate setting a Science-Based Target in the next two years provided no material change in industry and sustainability best practices."

"In 2010, Air Canada endorsed the global aviation industry targets set by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) to collectively achieve a reduction in CO2 emissions of 50% by 2050 relative to 2005 levels. This absolute target generally aligns with a science-based target of a 2°C scenario. In 2012, Air Canada (via the National Airlines Council of Canada) further endorsed the global industry collective targets through Canada's Action Plan to Reduce Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Aviation: a voluntary agreement between aviation partners and the Federal Government. This target includes the most important GHG sources of Air Canada's scope 1 emissions: jet fuel consumption. As Air Canada's operations have grown through the years, the achievement of an absolute reduction target is ambitious. Air Canada continues to improve fuel efficiency through many initiatives and is closely involved in the development of sustainable alternative jet fuels which will contribute to this target."
"In 2019, Air Canada initiated work on a Company specific climate strategy, conducting extensive climate scenario analysis taking into consideration both Canada's domestic climate commitments, as well as scenario analysis based on the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) methodology.

Despite the Covid?19 public healthcrisis and if no action is taken, the forecasts for global air traffic growth in the coming years could, however, see this proportionincrease.The aviation industry is the first economic sector to have set ambitious long?term reduction targets and to have adopted a worldwide carbon offsetting system within the framework of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) to guarantee carbon?neutral growth for global air transportation as of 2020.In 2009, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) thus set ambitious worldwide targets for reducing the CO2 emissionsfrom air transportation:— 1.5% average annual fuel efficiency improvement until 2020;— carbon neutral growth from 2020 onwards;— a 50% reduction in net aviation CO2 emissions in 2050relative to the 2005 level.While international aviation is not included in the Paris Climate Agreement, the industry's efforts respond to the latter's targetof limiting the global temperature increase to below 2°C. In its Energy Technology Perspectives 2017, the International EnergyAgency considers that the airline industry's target for 2050 is more ambitious than what would be required for a 2°C scenario(2°C Scenario – 2DS) and close to a scenario of beyond 2°C (Beyond 2°C Scenario – B2DS) without taking into account theeffects of carbon offsetting.Air France – KLM endorses the IATA's targets and has set itself proprietary intermediate targets aimed at reducing its CO2 emissions by 2020, 2030 and 2050.See Universal registration Document p189 4.3.1 Carbon emissions Context and strategy (https://www.airfranceklm.com/en/finance/publications)"
"Air France and KLM have the target of operating a carbon-neutral ground operations by 2030. This includes scope 1 and scope 2 emissions related to gas, cooled and heated water, diesel, GtL, kerosene for ground bounded engine testing, and electricity used in the ground operations in France and the Netherlands. n 2020, we reduced our CO2 emissions by 68% compared to 2018. The progress is largely made through increasing energy efficiency, electrification of the ground support equipment en by switching to renewable electricity in all KLM locations at and around Schiphol Airport. Air France plans to reach 90% of GSE electrification  in 2025We have not submitted this target for approval by the Science-Based Targets initiative as it covers only 1% of our total CO2 emissions. We do however consider this as a Science-Based Target as the EU member states must be carbon neutral by 2050 to realize a 1,5 degrees scenario. By setting the target year for achieving carbon neutrality  twenty years earlier, we aim to contribute to reaching the EU targets."
"Air Liquide is committed to reducing its CO2 emissions in absolute terms by 33% by 2035. This includes direct emissions from its hydrogen production and cogeneration units, as well as indirect emissions related to the production of electricity and steam purchased by the Group for its activities."
"Carbon neutrality applies to the entire value chain. Air Liquide is working today on all its scopes, and has already set quantified objectives for scopes 1 & 2. Work on scope 3 is underway in the chemicals sector to harmonize reporting methods."
"This target is part of our ''High5+” plan to reduce emissions by 40% by 2030 (baseline 2015). The target covers scope 1, scope 2 and a subset of scope 3 (upstream logistics and transportation). It has been calculated following the SBT methodology and updated in 2019 in line with the ''well below 2°c scenario”. It has not been certified by SBTi as the perimeter does not include sufficient scope 3 emissions yet.The 2020 status shows a significant decrease of environmental footprint compared to 2019 due to the unexpected and unprecedented COVID-19 crisis, materially affecting the Company's commercial aircraft operations. CO2 emissions have decreased by around 20% in 2020, in part due to the decrease of industrial activities mainly in the Company's commercial aircraft operations. Nevertheless, significant efforts have been made on all environmental aspects with regards to metering and digitising data acquisition and analysis in order to comply with long-term objectives."
"This target is an annual target set for Airbus (42 sites across Airbus Divisions, excluding Subsidiaries and Airbus sites outsite Europe. Additional sites are integrated in the scope of this target each year, when efficient monthly monitoring and project roadmap are available), in line with the well-below 2°C scenario."
"This target concerns the reduction of CO2 emissions from our fleet of specialised transport aircraft (Beluga) used for internal logistic transporting aircraft structures between production sites and assembly lines. The objective is to reduce Beluga emissions by 30% by 2030 (2019 baseline) through the gradual introduction of Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) in the fuel used by the aircraft fleet. This comes as a contribution to our global High5+ plan to reduce industrial emissions (scope 1, 2 and a subset of scope 3) by 40% by 2030 (2015 baseline), which was set up using science based target methodology and guidelines but has not been submitted for validation since industrial emissions do not cover the required two-third of value chain emissions."
"Mainly for the company's production and operation of energy consumption, including electricity, gas, and diesel."
"This year we announced our commitment to achieve carbon neutrality for our corporate operations by 2021, which includes our Scope 1 emissions and Scope 2 corporate emissions.  We will offset our Scope 1 emissions with carbon credits. Previously, we have set up a goal to purchase 1% renewable electricity in our Sydney West and Melbourne data centres, and 100% renewable electricity in our Sydney Head Office. This covers 100% of our corporate electricity consumption and related Scope 2 emissions. We have achieved our goal annually since 2018. The customer electricity consumption and related Scope 2 emissions are not covered by this target.  We aim for our carbon action to expand beyond our corporate emissions and are working to set Paris-aligned climate targets for our business. We are in the process of working with our customers and partners to achieve this."
"Scope 1 covers direct emissions from fuel consumotion of stationary plants (gas), from mobile source (vehicle fleet, petrol, diesel) and process emissions. Scope 2 covers indirect emissions from the purchase of electricity and district heating. The target for Scope 1 and 2 has already been achieved through a variety of energy efficiency measures (e.g. switching to LED) as well as through the procurement of electricity from renewable energy sources. We will set new CO2 reduction targets this year (both for Scope 1 + 2 and Scope 3, especially with regard to the Scope 3 category of purchased goods and services, which accounts for a high proportion of emissions)."

"The target is to reduce absolute GHG market-based emissions below 2015 levels by 2020. This work will be accomplished by procuring renewable energy and building colocation partnerships through the Renewable Energy Buyers Alliance (REBA) Future of Internet Power (FoIP). Akamai will cover 50% of our global network energy consumption of our paid leased facilities. We have achieved just over 100% of our goal renewable goal due to our colocation partnerships that supply 100% renewable energy and direct-vPPA renewable projects invested in to bring net-new renewables to market. We saw a 109,540 MT reduction in our CO2e footprint in 2020.When we look at our baseline targets from 2015 against per-gigabit capacity on the platform, Akamai was able to divert ~440% of its carbon emissions through the end of 2020. The data is based on platform efficiency, due to lower hardware power consumption while still having continued capacity growth within a similar data center power footprint close to baseline. Under this view, since 2015, we have mitigated over ~950,000 MT of potential carbon emissions when compared to today per gigabit of capacity served by our networkThe % of emissions in Scope is less than 100% because the target is focused on GHG emissions associated with Akamai's global network and office operations. It makes up ~92% of our total impact, which includes:1) Akamai operated and owned data centers and colocation facilities (including server hardware)2) Leased, colocation data centers (including server hardware)3) Leased office space (Includes lab space)This does not include items in Scope 3:1) Data Centers where Akamai has free space and power to support operations of network partnersABS1 was initially reported on the 2017 CDP report.Akamai is investing in virtual power purchase agreements (vPPAs) in target regions where we have significant network operations. We also incepted a program in conjunction with the REBA's FoIP to educate data center operators on procuring affordable renewable energy to power their facilities through a newly pioneered program Called LESSEN which will help with additional GHG reductions beyond 2020."
"The target was established to reduce absolute GHG market-based emissions in Akamai's Scope 1 and Market-Based Scope 2 to Net-Zero (0) by 2030. This work  and approach will be mainly accomplished by procuring renewable energy and building colocation partnerships through the Renewable Energy Buyers Alliance (REBA) Future of Internet Power (FoIP).Akamai will mitigate 100% of our global server energy consumption in our paid leased facilities, Akamai Owned Data Centers (AODC) and diesel generators under our operational control. Please Noter: Only 38 MT accounts for our diesel generators at our AODC's, the rest of this figure falls into Scope 2"
"The target was established to reduce absolute GHG market-based emissions in Akamai's Market-Based Scope 2 to Net-Zero (0) by 2030. Akamai will approach this work mainly by procuring renewable energy. In addition, we will look to offset our Natural Gas usage from only creditable and attestable offset sources such as those from: Gold Standard, Verified Carbon Standard, Climate Action Reserve, American Carbon Registry, Plan Vivo and The Climate, Community & Biodiversity Alliance. We will also explore emerging technology such as carbon and emissions capture technology when it becomes available."
"The target was established to reduce absolute GHG market-based emissions in Akamai's Market-Based Scope 2 to Net-Zero (0) by 2030. Akamai will approach this work mainly by procuring renewable energy and building colocation partnerships through the Renewable Energy Buyers Alliance (REBA) Future of Internet Power (FoIP) to mitigate emissions coming from Power Usage Efficiency (PUE). PUE includes our portion of Cooling,  UPS and common areas services for those data center providers that do not convert to renewable power in their operations."
"The target was established to reduce absolute GHG market-based emissions in Akamai's Scope 3: Upstream leased assets by 93% by 2030. Akamai will approach this work mainly by procuring renewable energy.  This goal is focused on mitigating 100% of our global server energy consumption in our non-paid, Akamai Accelerated Network Partners (AANP) and free space and traffic deployments globally."
"Akastor's own emissions are limited to the office- and travel related emissions of its 15 employees. Compared to the climate-related issues in Akastor's investment activities, its own emissions are insignificant. Scope 3 emissions are expected to increase due to increased overseas activities, which will necessitate more travel. Scope 2 emissions, which are from Akastor's office activities, are expected to remain stable over the next five years. Akastor will reduce the net CO2 emissions from our own activities to zero by 2030."
"Akbank plans to beceome a carbon-netural bank by eliminating its gross CO2 emissions of its company-wide facilities (covering Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions) until 2025 by implementing SBTi with well-below 2°C aligned target ambition. In order to calculate yearly emission reduction plan, as Akbank, we conducted scenario analysis for the intervals of 2020-2025 in terms of the scenarios of keeping the global temperature way below 2 degrees Celsius (WB2C) When we chose 2020 as the base year, we have to decrease our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 12.5% since 2025. Akbank will become a carbon neutral bank by taking the following steps:•Decreasing the operational emissions through current and future energy efficiency projects•Switching to 100% Renewable Electricity By June 2021, we are planning to purchase  60% of electricity from REWe aim to reduce our energy consumption by 5% with the solar energy panels to be installed•Carbon offsetting While we implement the 2 steps above, we will be carbon neutral by offsetting the remaining carbon emissions in 2025."
Aker BP has committed to reduce CO2 emissions  according to the Paris agreement.  Target covers all our operated assets
"Ivar Aasen started up in 2016 and in 2017 the scope 2 emissions were 127170 tons.  However, 2017 was a year with only partial water injection and gas compression., therefore 2018 is chosen as baseline.   Flaring was higher than expected in 2018, so the baseline is slightly higher due to this.  Aker BP will implement power from shore to Ivar Aasen in 2023, so reductions will be  approximately 95% in 2023 due to upset flaring on Edvard Grieg (estimated to 5%).  Methodology for science based target initiative not available for Oil & Gas"

"Aker BP has committed to reduce CO2 emissions  according to the Paris agreement, and has set a target to reach close to zero emission by 2050 for all our operated assets"
"Our target covers 100% of our Scope 1 and  Scope 2 emsissions. We consider this to be a Science Based target, and that our ambition is 1.5°C aligned, since our target exceeds 4.2% year-on-year emissions reductions between base year and target year."
"Albaraka Turk has medium and long-term targets milestones  (see 'Abs 1' and 'Abs 2'). Our Abs1 emission reduction target includes a 35% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 2030 against the 2018 baseline.  Albaraka's 2020 scope 1 and 2 emissions were  9,994.35 tCO2-e, equivalent to a 9.99% emission reduction from the 2018 base year emissions,meaning we are  reaching our target (9.99/35 = 29.95%).Furthermore, Albaraka Turk signed the science-based targets letter for financial Institutions in 2020 and this target was also submitted to the SBTi Validation Team."
"Albaraka Turk has medium and long term targets milestones  (see 'Abs 1' and 'Abs 2'). Our Abs2 emission reduction target includes a 65% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 2036 against the 2018 baseline.  Albaraka's 2020 scope 1 and 2 emissions were  9,994.35 tCO2-e, equivalent to a 9.99% emission reduction from the 2018 base year emissions,meaning we are  reaching our target (9.99/65 = 16.12%).Furthermore, Albaraka Turk signed the science-based targets letter for financial Institutions in 2020 and this target was also submitted to the SBTi Validation Team."
"This target covers all of our scope 1 & 2 emissions. In 2020, our progress to decarbonise our own operations continued, however with the caveat of Covid-19. Our energy efficiency programs are at the heart of our success. Our electricity usage intensity per sq. ft decreased by 27% relative to 2016, and 38% relative to our historical baseline (2013).  Having more and more stores proactively choose renewable energy contracts with their energy providers is another measure that is having a strong impact in reducing our scope 2 emissions. All but one distribution center (DC) are no longer under operational control, as of 2019. This has resulted in a drop in electricity and natural gas consumption as well as fugitive emissions; the intensity figures of 27% and 38% are independent of DC energy usage being reallocated as a scope 3 category."
"We have an absolute target of 30% reduction in scope 3 emissions because we are members of the United Nations Fashion Industry Charter for Climate Action (UN FICCA).  This target covers all relevant scope 3 categories: purchased G&S, F&E activities, upstream transportation, waste, business travel, upstream leased assets (3PL DCs), downstream transportation, end-of-life treatment of sold products and franchises. Use of sold products is considered immaterial as our footwear, handbags and accessories are seldom cleaned during their use phase. The majority of our improvement has been due to more efficient product transportation, reduced business travel, improved packaging materials and lower emissions product materials.  Note that FY2020 product materials & manufacturing emissions has not yet been calculated therefore we are unable to fill out the appropriate field."
"Alfa Laval's carbon emissions target aimed at reducing carbon emissions by 15% between 2015 and 2020.The target reported in our Sustainability Report 2020 (see page 28 of Alfa Laval's Sustainability Report 2020) refers primarily to energy consumption within and outside the organization (Scope 1 and Scope 2 market-based emissions):emissions in 2015 = 76,777 tonnes CO2eemissions in 2020 = 35,465 tonnes CO2e-> 54% decreaseIn the answer to this particular question we further apply a broader approach to our carbon emissions and disclose emissions in Scope 1+Scope 2 (market-based)+Scope 3 (see page 47 of Alfa Laval's Sustainability Report 2020). Scope 1 includes energy consumption within the organization and company cars. Scope 2 includes direct emissions (market-based method) and Scope 3 includes goods transportation, business travel (air travel and rental cars). The base year and the year the target was set is 2015 and the strategy period was 2016–2020:emissions in 2015 (Scope 1+2 market-based + 3 downstream) = 155,093 tonnes CO2eemissions in 2019 (Scope 1+2 market-based + 3 downstream) = 83,399 tonnes CO2e-> 54% decrease since the base year.The base year emissions figure was revised due to organizational changes and a transition to a new reporting and data management system.To ensure Alfa Laval reached its carbon emission target, we continuously work to increase the proportion of renewable electricity used. In 2020, 78% of Alfa Laval's electricity was sourced from renewable sources, compared with 27% in 2015 (see page 46 of Sustainability report 2020). We further continue to increase the share of power purchase agreements in our global electricity supply. We focused on sites where electricity was generated from coal or other fossil fuels. Recently, six of our large operation sites in China and India began to source 100% of their electricity from renewable sources. However, our carbon emissions from goods transport remain high due to greater transport need and more air freight compared to sea freight. In 2020, emissions from goods transportation amounted to 42,864 tonnes of CO2e, a 15% decrease relatively to 2019 and a 7% drecrease compared to the baseline 2015 (see page 28 of Alfa Laval's Sustainability Report 2020). Goods transportation emissions per tonne kilometre were 93 gram/tonkm compared with 92 gram/tonkm, which was the baseline 2015."
We have achieved our GHG emission reduction target by slightly over one million metric tonnes CO2e earlier than  our 2023 deadline.Note: The % of target achieved was calculated as: (Covered emissions in base year - Covered emissions in reporting year)/Targeted reduction from base year.
During the base year of 2018 we produced 0.72 metric tons of CO2  from the use of Furnace Oil. During reporting year we did not use furnace oil as source of fuel for Boilers at all and  CO2 emissions are zero for the reporting year starting from 1 Jan 2020 to 31 December 2020.
"At the end of 2020, the CO2 emissions had fallen by 22% to (6,612 tonnes) compared to baseline (9,658 tonnes). The target covers all production sites, which account for apporx. 76% of our global workforce. In addition to these sites, ALK has smaller sales offices in several countries worldwide. These are usually small offices in rented buildings, and ALK has little opportunity to make significant changes at these locations, which is why they are determined to be out of scope for environmental target-setting and reporting. ALK does however conduct awareness-raising initiatives at these locations and to the extent possible seek to make changes that positively impact the environment. One example is our offices in the Netherlands that have switched to majority electric or hybrid cars, a solution that works at this particular location because of the short distances travelled by sales representatives."

"Alliant Energy strives to accelerate emissions reductions as part of its Clean Energy Vision.  In 2020, our fossil-fuel generation carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions decreased 42% from 2005 levels.  We also recently achieved one of our goals – to have 30% of our energy mix come from carbon-free renewable resources – 10 years ahead of schedule. In 2020, our Clean Energy Vision goals were updated given the significant progress achieved adding new company-owned wind generation (1,150 MW) and plans to implement solar generation (1,500 MW). The updated goals are:- Achieving a 50% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2030 (up from our prior goal of 40%)- Eliminating all coal from our generation fleet by 2040 (10 years faster than our previous target) - Adding an aspirational goal that achieves net-zero CO2 emissions from the electricity we generate by 2050- Adding a new goal that 100% of our active company-owned light-duty fleet vehicles will be electric by 2030Furthermore, Alliant Energy added another new goal in 2021, an initiative to donate and help plant more than one million trees – one tree for each of our customers – over the next decade.Alliant Energy's plans for a clean energy future are expected to be consistent with the carbon reductions and climate goals pledged originally by the U.S. under the voluntary United Nations Paris Accord.  Our company is participating in an Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) technical study assessing the relationship between company-specific carbon transition scenarios and scientific research on the projected emission reductions derived from global climate warming models. Key insights from the published study found that there is significant uncertainty between modeled predictions for achieving a global temperature goal and an individual company's emission pathway. EPRI's updated evaluation ""Review of 1.5°C and Other Newer Global Emissions Scenarios"" provides additional insights when considering how to attain a net-zero goal. This includes finding that significant additional electrification and continued fossil energy use could be consistent with limiting warming to 2°C and even 1.5? by 2050. Alliant Energy believes that our aspirational net-zero CO2 goal is within the range of plausible scenarios shown in EPRI's technical study to limit global warming.

"The target was set in Q4 2020. The target covers the asset classes listed equity and corporate bonds of our insurance investment portfolio. The target has been developed in line with the Target-Setting Protocol of the UN-convened Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance which is rooted in climate science, following no / low overshoot pathways of the IPCC Special Report on 1.5°C. We expect the Protocol as well as our targets to become accepted / verified by SBTi during 2021, early 2022.On covered emissions we entered 100% as the targets cover all our emissions under the asset classes we are we currently able to measure GHG emissions. For asset classes like sovereign bonds or private listings methodologies are not yet agreed upon in the sector but Allianz is working to solve this as part of the ASCOR project of Ceres, IIGCC, PRI, AOA, TPI and others."
"Our covered emissions for our base year was 98,963. Our covered emissions in reporting year was 97,799. That is a total reduction of 1,164 in covered emissions."
"Alma Media has set a combined emissions reduction target (science-based) for its Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions. According to the target, by 2025 the company  will reduce its Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions by 21  per cent (an absolute  target) from the 2016 base year. In 2020,  Alma Media's combined Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions fell by 48 per cent compared to the reference year (2016), to 731 tCO2eq, calculated using the market-based method. The reported figures have been adjusted to reflect the outsourcing of the delivery operations and the divestment of the regional news media and printing businesses as well as the effect of other restructuring moves and changes in business operations in 2016–2020.Alma Media's science-based Scope 1 and 2 target covers GHG emissions caused by the use of electricity, district heating and district cooling in all Alma Media's properties, and the GHG emissions caused by Alma Media's leased cars. The emissions caused by distributing Alma Media's newspapers have been reported as part of Alma Media's Scope 3 emissions.Alma Media's science-based Scope 1 and 2 target has been calculated in such a way that the emissions trajectory goes from the base year of 2016 until 2050.

"Every year, we have a goal of being carbon neutral. As of December 31, 2020, we reached carbon neutrality for 100% of our FY2020 operational emissions, which represent Scope 1 + Scope 2 (market-based) + Scope 3 (business travel, candidate travel, and employee commuting).Abs1 covers Scope 1 + Scope 2 (market-based) + Scope 3 (business travel, candidate travel, and employee commuting). We committed to being carbon neutral in 2007 and we have achieved this goal each year since then. We maintain our commitment to carbon neutrality of our operational footprint first through energy efficiency, second, by signing long-term contracts for renewable energy directly from our utility providers and from renewable energy facilities in the same grid regions as our data centers, and lastly, by investing in high-quality carbon offset projects. In 2020, we achieved 14 consecutive years of carbon neutrality. In 2020, we also neutralized our legacy carbon footprint since our founding, making Google the first major company to be carbon neutral for its entire operating history.We understand that CDP does not acknowledge carbon offsets as a way to reduce emissions, however, we do recognize offsets as a viable and important approach for mitigating our carbon emissions impact, as well as a critical component of our three-tiered carbon neutrality strategy. In June 2021, Google announced that we had joined the Exponential Roadmap Initiative and the Race to Zero. In joining the Race to Zero and the Exponential Roadmap Initiative, Google commits to halving emissions before 2030 towards net zero throughout the value chain.

"Abs2 includes Low1, as well as Scope 1 emissions. In 2012, we set a long-term goal to purchase enough renewable energy to match all the electricity we consume globally on an annual basis. For the past four years (2017-2020) we achieved it: Google's total purchase of energy from sources like wind and solar exceeded the amount of electricity used by our operations around the world, including offices, data centers, and networking infrastructure. While we're still drawing power from the grid, some of which is from fossil fuel resources, we're purchasing enough wind and solar energy to match every megawatt-hour (MWh) of electricity our data center and office operations consume annually. In 2020, our annual GHG reductions from our renewable energy projects were 4.9 million metric tons. This puts us 341% of the way towards this goal from an emissions reduction perspective. Google is the largest annual corporate purchaser of renewable energy in the world. From 2010 to 2020, we've signed more than 55 agreements totaling nearly 6 gigawatts of renewable energy. Reaching our 100% renewable purchasing goal means that Google buys on an annual basis the same amount of MWh of renewable energy—both the physical energy and its corresponding renewable energy certificates (RECs)—as the amount of MWh of electricity that we consume for our operations around the world. Where possible, we buy this energy directly from our utility providers and from renewable energy facilities in the same grid regions as our data centers.Since we're using Abs2 as our interim target for Abs3 and it would be difficult to predict our emissions in 2040, we used most of the same data here for Abs3 as we did for Abs2. We know we'll increase our annual GHG emissions reduction by at least 1.8 million tCO2e of emissions (our Abs2 target) sometime before 2040. The actual reduction in tCO2 will likely be greater as we believe our Scope 2 emissions will grow between our base year and 2040. Matching 100% renewable energy is just the beginning. We'll continue to buy renewable energy to match our growing electricity load. And in those regions where we can't yet buy renewables, we'll keep working on ways to help open the market. By 2030, we aim to operate on carbon-free energy 24/7. For more details about our 24/7 Carbon-free Energy goal, see https://sustainability.google/commitments/"

"An emissions reduction target is science based if it is in scale of reduction required to keep global warming below 2°C. That requires at least an annual reduction of CO2 emissions of 1,23%. To stay well bellow 2°C an annual linear reduction of 2.5% is required. With a target that aims for 10% reduction with a base year of 2018 and a target year of 2020 our target would be considered as a science based target."

"We assume our 2018 purchases have been over estimated.Data collection has been made more precise in 2020. As the target is reached, we decide to close this targetHowever, ALTEN as implemented several actions in order to decrease its scope 3 emissions:With the signing of the Climate Engineering Charter at the end of 2019, ALTEN strengthened its commitment to promotingsustainable development, integrated at the heart of its strategy of development.The 2019-2022 purchasing policy and program ALTEN's Purchasing policy is carried out by the Purchasing Department Group. It is built around the following 5 axes of work:1. the business line, aimed at sharing and supporting the parties internal stakeholders in the formalization, application and monitoring of procurement process and best practices;2. the economic axis to guarantee the purchasing performance of the business;3. the quality and performance axis which measures and monitors performance its suppliers, partners and subcontractors;4. the business relationship axis, dedicated to integrity and sustainability supplier relationships while stimulating innovation and competition;5. the risk axis, relating to the control of risks whatever their nature: financial, societal, SSI, confidentiality, CSR, legal,ALTEN image, regulations and certifications.The Purchasing Department oversees the deployment of the program 2019-2022 purchases in synergy with the other Departments of the business. This program aims to continue to provide:l defining a specific steering strategy for the subjects priority;continuous improvement of the purchasing function across the Group.Since 2018 but also in 2019, several structuring projects were conducted for:-Update of the CSR evaluation of suppliersTransformation of management Information system for employee travel;.In 2019, the 1st Supplier Committee took place, bringing together 17 suppliers to make them aware of this approach and tohelp grow on this subject.In 2020, we revised our CSR questionnaire by intensifying the dialogue on climate with our suppliers"

"This target covers all Amadeus' Scope 1 and 2 emissions worldwide. Amadeus has established objectives to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions and become a carbon-neutral growth company.  In 2016 we set a company-wide carbon-neutral growth policy, with 2015 as the baseline year. To make this target more ambitious, our baseline year emissions are net of carbon offsets. Our gross emissions in 2015 without discounting carbon offset were 34,171 tons of CO2  - of which 2,364 tons CO2e were offset, and as already mentioned these are excluded from the base year resulting in 31,807 for our target.We have adapted this objective to make it compatible with our ambition to reduce our emissions to zero by 2050, in line with the objectives of the Paris Agreement. Accordingly, the objective for 2020 is calculated based on the linear rate of emissions reductions needed from the baseline year to achieve full carbon neutrality by 2050.Since we set the target in 2016, we have implemented measures to reduce emissions. We worked with the UNFCCC (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change) to offset the emissions that we could not avoid, to reach our target. We invested in Clean Development Mechanism projects in India and offset more than 32,000 tons of CO2, with Certified Emissions Reductions from these projects.In 2019 we took a significant step forward by moving the Data Center to 100% renewable energy. This was achieved through the purchase of Guarantees of Origin of renewable energy. In 2020, with the use of Guarantees of Origin we have reduced our CO2 emissions company-wide (Scope 2) by 70.5% and delivered net emissions reductions of 32,775 tons of Scope 2 emissions compared to the reported in 2018.  With this more ambitious strategy, direct reductions were achieved and we did not need to use offsetting credits."
"In 2017 we signed the UN Climate Neutral Pledge. In line with the Paris Agreement on climate change, and by signing the pledge, we commit to become climate neutral by 2050. As 2050 is a very long-term goal, we intend to achieve our target to become carbon neutral by 2030. Based on our objective of zero emissions by 2050,  and taking a linear approach, we have calculated that this long-term target needs a yearly reduction of 2.86% since the baseline year. Accordingly, in 2020 the targeted reduction from baseline year would be 14%, a percentage that we have significantly exceeded as hereby reported (52.63% of target achieved). Calculation of the yearly reduction:-Years to achieve the zero emissions 2050 – 2015 = 35-Percentage of emissions to reduce each year: 100/35 = 2.86%-Objective for 2020: (2020-2015) x 2.86% = 14%This target covers all Amadeus' Scope 1 and 2 emissions worldwide. In 2020 we have achieved a reduction of 52.63% CO2e in our combined Scope 1 & 2 from our baseline year thanks to energy efficiency measures and the implementation of 100% renewable energy at the Data Center through Guarantees of Origin (GOs) of renewable energy. Although this reduction is consistent with the continuous decrease of CO2e that we have been reporting last years, we are aware that it has been particularly remarkable in 2020 due to the partial or total closing of our offices as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic.More detailed information on our performance regarding emissions can be found at:http://www.amadeus.com/documents/corporate/corporate_responsibility/amadeus-operations-environmental-performance.pdf"
"In 2018, Ambipar carried out a technical, environmental, and economic feasibility study for capturing and using biogas generated at the Aracruz CTR (the organization's main source of emissions) for energy production.Although the study demonstrated the ''unfeasibility of the project to use biogas” for energy production, the organization decided to implement capturing and flaring without energy production. Considering the production of 25m³ CH4/t of waste; that 85% of the  biogas issued will be recovered and flaring efficiency standards are around 90%, by 2030 we expect it will be possible to reduce burning by about 76.5% of the methane generated at the Aracruz CTR. This flaring percentage will be revised due to another feasibility study that will be prepared for this flaring process."

"To calculate these targets, we relied on SBTi's guidance and tools, and reviewed the IPCC's 1.5 degree special report, to determine the appropriate level of ambition. With annual ambition of 3.3% (2030 target) and 2.7% (2040 target), both targets are aligned with 1.5 degree scenario, and adhere to criteria C19 of SBTi's April 2019 guidance (V4)."

"AEO joined the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change's (UNFCCC) Fashion Industry Charter for Climate Action in 2019, adopting their overarching goal of achieving 30% reduction across all scopes by 2030."
"AEO joined RE100 in 2019, committing to achieving carbon neutrality across all of our owned and operated facilities (offices, stores, distribution centers) and employee business travel by 2030. This includes sourcing 100% renewable electricity."
"In mid-2017, in response to ongoing engagement on these issues with various stakeholders, AEP began to develop new intermediate and long-term carbon reduction goals. In 2020, we undertook a year-long Climate Impact Analysis effort to analyse the risks to our company from climate change, as well as potential business opportunities it might create. The report reflects our commitment to working toward 100% clean energy while also addressing the physical risks to infrastructure and people from a changing climate and the socio-economic effects that coal-fueled power plant closures have on the workforce as well as local and regional economies. We reviewed our carbon emission reduction goals as part of this process and have accelerated them to achieve an 80% reduction by 2030 and net-zero emissions by 2050 (from a 2000 baseline).We have long believed that our clean energy transformation strategy is aligned with the Paris Agreement. The climate scenario analysis we undertook demonstrates that our strategy is on course with achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement. And, it reminds us that the transition must build resilience into the system to handle extremes. It also shows us that there are still many uncertainties about technology, resources and the pace and cost of the transition. Our path forward will evolve, and, as it does, we will continue to engage our stakeholders."
"We are committed to achieve carbon neutrality for our operations Scope 1 and 2 (market-based) and  Scope 3 (business travel and employee business travel, including third-party air, rail and rental cars) by 2025. Operations include all our managed facilities, field sites and data centers. To help us achieve this GHG goal, we are implementing energy efficiency projects and procuring renewable energy at our facilities. We also have an operational goal to reduce energy use by 35% across our global managed portfolio from 2011 to 2025. For unavoidable emissions we invest in certified carbon offsets to achieve the carbon neutrality commitment."
"We are committing to maintaining carbon neutrality for our operations Scope 1 and 2 (market-based) and Scope 3 (business travel) (employee business travel, including third-party air, rail and rental cars) through at least 2035.

"In 2020, AmFam committed to achieving carbon neutrality by 2030 for our scope 1, scope 2 (market-based) and scope 3 upstream emissions. The upstream scope 3 emissions covered by this commitment include Purchased goods and services (from paper and cloud services only), Fuel and energy-related activities (not included in Scopes 1 or 2), Waste generated in operations, and Business Travel. To reach this goal, we are continuing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through implementing energy efficiency projects, increasing on-site renewable energy production and renewable energy purchases, transitioning to a high-efficiency vehicle fleet, and diverting waste from the landfill. As part of this carbon neutrality commitment, we plan to reduce our emissions 50% by 2025. For unavoidable emissions, we are committed to purchasing carbon offsets where we operate. We consider this target science-based because it aligns with an over 4.2% annual linear reduction rate over the target period, which is consistent with the 1.5°C aligned target ambition."

"AIG is a supporter of the UK Carbon Reduction Commitment (CRC) in the UK, and has committed to reducing the Carbon emissions associated with its UK business operations by 20% by the year 2020.  AIG's UK operations have exceeded the target commitment, reducing overall Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 69%, more than three times the target. The CRC expired in 2020, so there won't be future reporting."
"Nearly all of our carbon footprint is attributed to generating power as a service for tenants in markets with non-existent or unreliable electric grids. Though we cannot control the energy demand from tenant equipment, we are working to reduce the associated scope 1 emissions by investing in efficiency improvements and renewable energy. Since 2017, we have invested approximately $160 million toward these efforts. We targeted these markets because they account for 99% of the total diesel purchased by American Tower, and a representative portion of the Company's scope 1 footprint. In 2020, we achieved an additional 8% reduction from 2019, reaching 53% of the 10-year goal. We intend to build on this momentum and are in the process of developing implementation plans to achieve greater GHG emission reductions that are aligned with the Paris Agreement and the Science-Based Targets initiative.Note that the baseline emissions figure has been revised to account for acquisitions in accordance with The Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (Revised Edition)."
"American Water has committed to reducing our GHG emissions by 40% from our base year of 2007 by 2025. Our GHG emissions as of 2020 were 545,111 MT CO2e meaning we achieved approximately a 36% reduction from our base year, and are 90% of the way toward our goal."
"In 2018, we set a goal to have 2-3% of our US electricity from on-site renewable sources by FY20. Since 2018, we have completed two on-site solar arrays at our Phoenix and Sacramento locations. Due to unexpected delays as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we are reporting this target as revised. While both were completed in FY20, due to them coming online much later than planned, they generated approximately 1% of our U.S. electricity for the year. With both projects now online, we anticipate we will achieve this goal by the end of 2021 for on-site generation. Globally, more than 3% of our purchased electricity comes from renewable sources (on-site and purchases). Additionally, we saw a decrease in Scope 2 emissions overall as a result of efficiency projects implemented over the last several years, and as mentioned previously, a reduction due to the impact of COVID-19 on our operations."
"In the beginning of 2021, we announced the intent to acquire Alliance Healthcare, formerly a part of the Walgreens Boots Alliance family. The acquisition was finalized in June 2021.  With the announcement of a new acquisition that would significantly change our carbon footprint, we determined it would not make sense to submit a formal target to the Science Based Target initiative (SBTi) until the acquisition was finalized and we could include our Alliance Healthcare footprint in our target. We made the decision to set a short-term target for the AmerisourceBergen portfolio inclusive of Scope 1 and 2 emissions for the interim while we determine our new global footprint including Alliance Healthcare. This interim target, a 5% reduction by the end of FY2022, was developed in line with the SBTi's criteria and guidelines. We have formally committed to set a science-based target through SBTi and plan to submit within the next year. Note on Target Status: While we have achieved a significant reduction year on year beyond the goal target, this is in part due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in the temporary closure of many of our offices and facilities as well as a reduction in fuel use. While we have continued to advance our efficiency improvements at our distribution centers, we do anticipate our emissions to rise slightly as we ''return to normal” and our offices reopen."
"In 2020 we initiated our third multi-year environmental sustainability plan with the aspiration to achieve carbon neutrality by year end 2027.   Our carbon neutrality encompasses 100 percent of Amgen's Scope 1 and Scope 2 (market-based) emissions.  This includes emissions from our sales fleet; fugitive emissions from purchased and generated carbon dioxide and refrigerant losses; executive travel; and from energy usage in our operations.  For energy use in our operations, we track invoiced energy usage from 88 percent of our worldwide facility space, based on total square feet and calculate emissions from fuel and supplied electricity emission factors.  Energy and carbon data for the remaining 12 percent of facility space is estimated based on building energy intensity factors and country specific emission factors. This includes leased buildings where we have operational control over building infrastructure, including utilities."
"We track a variety of climate-related metrics across our operations and value chain. We believe our new goals demonstrate to our stakeholders that we are committed to reducing our environmental impact, while also reducing our exposure to a carbon price. Our commitment to carbon neutrality by 2030 involves a combination of approaches, including reducing our emissions, migrating energy procurement in favor of renewable and clean energy, and purchasing carbon offsets. By doing so, we are finding ways to reduce the potential effect of future carbon prices on our business. We will continue to measure and disclose our performance against our goals. There is also a plan to generate 100% renewable energy by 2030."
"AMP recognises that it has a corporate responsibility to seek to reduce its environmental footprint including greenhouse gas emissions. In 2013, AMP became carbon neutral for the first time. Since then, AMP has maintained its carbon neutral commitment in each subsequent year. Achieving greater performance in this area is the right thing to do as a responsible corporate citizen for our clients, people and community. AMP has targets to reduce scope 1 and 2 emissions by 42% by 2030 (compared to our 2019 base year). We have updated our base year to 2019 to account for the sale of AMP Life, which represents a structural change to our emissions inventory."
"This target is a combined  target for all 5 former ams sites in Austria, Singapore and Philippines, rolled up form the individual site targets. They represent about 25% of the scope 2 emissions o f ams-OSRAM overall. For ams manufacturing in Austria, Premstaetten, we are purchasing 100% from hydropower. and thus there can be no additional contribution. The target was missed by about 3.8% driven by increased output at two facilities in Singapore.Since ams took over OSRAM only in March 2021 there was no unified system for 2020 yet. We have set common goals for 2021 though."
"This target reflects the ambition of the former OSRAM business to be CO2 neutral in 2030, reflecting about 70% of all CO2 emissions of ams-OSRAM.The former OSRAM  Environmental System covered 99% of the impact as assessed and reported in our Sustainability Report. This comprises our relevant production sites with more than 1400 MWh energy consumption per year,  our company and US headquarters and larger R&D sites. Not in-scope are smaller sales offices and R&D sites. We believe to have reached the practical limits.The target was approved and announced in November 2019, i.e. after the reporting period was finished. https://www.osram-group.com/en/media/press-releases/pr-2019/25-11-2019 The baseline of 265,000 tons CO2 (absolute)  is derived from our FY2019 emissions (268,900 tons CO2) minus divested or closed sites which will no longer appear in our reporting going forward (i.e. FY20, next reporting period)."
"This Abs3 target is a year-by-year target in connection with Abs2. It measured the deviation from our road map. For FY2020, the goal was to stop the bleeding and emit NO MORE CO2 than OSRAM did last FY2019.

"In FY20, we reduced GHG emissions by 14% (131,030 MT of CO2e) compared to last year surpassing our 2.6% target.  The target included Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. The significant reduction was due to decreased train service as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.  While operating levels impacted fuel and electricity consumption, our employees continued to focus on reduced idling and energy consumption wherever possible.The GHG reduction target is set and measured annually to align with a larger goal to achieve a 40% reduction compared to a 2010 baseline. The target includes sources in all categories of our Scope 1 and 2 emissions including all locomotive diesel fuel, traction power for Amtrak's electric trains, electricity, natural gas and steam used in Amtrak facilities, fuels for maintenance equipment, refrigerants, and highway fleet fuel."
"With the urgency of climate change at the forefront of decision making, we have committed to a 50% reduction in carbon emissions by 2025. This is against a baseline that has been measured and independently verified. An Post believes that transparency and accountability are at the heart of making sustainability actions credible. In December 2019 we committed to the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) aligning climate and sustainability targets with an ambitious 1.5°C limit in line with the Paris Agreement and are working to define our science based targets this year."

We have set an absolute target of a 50% reduction to Scope 1 + Scope 2 emissions by 2030 relative to a 2019 baseline. This target covers all our locations.
from 2020 all the energy supplied to the company is 100 renewable
due to the Covid-19 situation the target was revised and the goal is to maintain during 2021 the same level of emissions for scope 2.
"The target relates to our Gross Operational Carbon emissions and covers the period 2015-20. It was achieved through delivering energy efficiency projects, increasing our renewable energy, designing carbon out of new projects and a significant decarbonisation of grid electricity. When the target was set in 2015 we would judge that it was in the context of reducing global temperatures well below a 2 degree rise on pre-industrial levels."
"In conjunction with others English water companies, in late 2020 Anglian Water committed to become net zero carbon by 2030. We are currently developing our own Anglian Water specific net zero carbon 2030 routemap which we plan to publish in July 2021. This target uses the market based methodology, previously Anglian Water has reported using the location based methodology. By committing to net zero by 2030 we would take the view that this target is aligned to keeping temperatures well below 2 degrees higher than pre-industrial levels but demonstrates our commitment to pursuing a 1.5 degree trajectory."
This is our new 5-year Gross Operational Carbon emissions target which replaces our 2020 target described above and was set as part of our regulatory requirement. This target has now been complemented by our commitment to achieving net zero carbon by 2030.
"This is our target to reduce the capital carbon in our 5 yearly investment programme.  Once a project is approved for delivery it's 2010 capital carbon baseline is calculated.  Once the project is completed the actual capital carbon is measured - allowing a % reduction against the baseline to be calculated.  Anglian Water has hundreds of models to support this measurement process.    The long term company target is to achieve a reduction of the total baseline carbon for all the projects in the 2025-2030 investment programme by 70%.  The projects for the 2025-2030 period have not yet been identified.  Therefore, it is not yet possible to confirm the 2010 capital carbon baseline nor current actual capital carbon for the projects in the 2025-2030 period.  The ""Covered emissions..."" have therefore been reported as follows:""....in base year"" = the 2010 capital carbon baseline for the projects in the 2020-21 period""...in reporting year"" = the calculated capital carbon at 31/03/21 for the projects in the 2020-21 period The 2015 target was a 50% reduction, the 2020 was 60%, the 2025 is 65% and the 2030 target is 70%.   We beat the 2015 reduction target of 15% and in 2021 our actual was 61.3% compared to our 2021 target of 61%.We are currently developing our post-2030 capital carbon reduction strategy where we hope to deliver even larger capital carbon reductions. Although this target is not science based, we believe our performance in this area is market leading and therefore aligns with the the ambition of limiting global temeratures to a 1.5 degree rise"
"Anglo American Platinum aligns with the Anglo American 2020 energy and carbon targets, and sustainability strategy 2030 climate-change stretch goals. Our energy-efficiency target for 2030 is a 30% reduction in our absolute energy intensity against our 2016 performance, while our long term GHG emissions target is a net 30% reduction in emissions against the 2016 level. The long term stretch targets align with our aspiration to achieve carbon neutrality across our operations, we are focusing on radically reducing energy consumption through our FutureSmart Mining™ programme, switching to low-carbon energy sourcing and increasing the role of renewables in our energy mix. In2019, we have been completing technical reviews to identify priority energy and carbon reduction options at our major operations. Operational site-specific targets have been cascaded and monthly progress per site is reported."
"Anglo American Platinum aligns with the Anglo American 2020 energy and carbon targets, and sustainability strategy 2030 climate-change stretch goals. Our 2020 target of 10% absolute reduction in emissions was not fully met despite a reduction in emissions. This target is set at a company wide level.We are on track to achieve our 2030 targets. Continued work on operational productivity and energy efficiency sustained our steady decline in levels of GHG emissions generated and energy consumption."
"ABI has set a new SBTi approved science-based target for carbon reduction across our value chain. Our target: to reduce 35% in absolute value our Scope 1 and 2 emissions and to reduce 25% GHG emissions per beverage throughout our value chain by 2025 (scopes 1, 2, and 3) vs a 2017 baseline."
"During the reporting year, our climate consultant leveraged the SBTi Target Setting tool to determine a scope 1 and 2 target that aligns with a 1.5 degree Celsius scenario.  We estimate that total Scope 1 and 2 reduction needs to be 53,648 tons by 2030, which is a 46% reduction from the 2019 baseline.  We will leverage a combined demand side efficiency and a 100% renewables strategy to meet this target."
"In 2018, Antofagasta Minerals was one of the first mining companies to adopt a GHG emission reduction target of Scope 1 and 2, which was set at 300,000 tons of CO2e by 2022 compared to its 2017 values. Thanks to a series of initiatives, which include migrating the companies' energy contracts to only renewable energies, the Group not only fulfilled its objective two years earlier, but also almost doubled it, by reducing emissions by 580,000 tons of CO2e. In July 2020, Minera Zaldívar became the first company in the Group to operate with electricity from only renewable sources. This is in addition to part of the supply that Minera Los Pelambres uses, which today is generated from wind and solar sources. By the end of next year, all the Group's companies will use electricity from 100% clean sources, which do not generate emissions to the environment.Antofagasta plc during 2021 will announce new goals for reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to help tackle climate change and continue moving towards increasingly sustainable mining. The first objective is to reduce its direct and indirect emissions (scope 1 and 2) by 30% by 2025 compared to its 2020 values, which is equivalent to 730,000 tons of CO2e.The possibility of having a science-based goal is being analyzed to be aligned with national and international goals."
"In its corporate responsibility programme Apetit has set a target to reduce its climate impats. Apetit will reduce its direct CO2 emissions by 75% by transitioning to energy solutions based on renewable resources and by improving energy efficiency. The reduction of emissions in 2020 was mainly caused by Apetit switching to electricity generated by wind power in all of its production sites. Apetit updated its corporate responsibility programme and the targets in early 2021, as continuation to the earlier targets set in 2019. Making the initial emission targets in 2019 in its earlier responsibility programme, Apetit had emission reduction targets only set by intensity.

"This target follows the guidelines of the Dutch LTA (long term agreement energy reduction) system called MJA-3. This method covers energy efficiency during production, raw material savings and lower energy consumption during usage (chain savings).This method meets the requirement of the European Energy Directive (EED)."
"For years, we have increased energy efficiency and the use of renewable energy, yet we know we have to do more. That's why last year, we unveiled our most ambitious plan to date: to achieve carbon neutrality for the entire life cycle of our products by 2030. Our plan to reach neutrality by 2030 centers around our strategy to reduce emissions by 75 percent, relative to our 2015 footprint. This reduction aligns with what current climate science shows is necessary to limit warming to 1.5° Celsius. The Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) recently validated an emissions reduction target for Apple: 61.7 percent by 2030 relative to our 2019 emissions. This SBTi-approved target is derived from our current target—to reduce emissions by 75 percent by 2030—only with a 2019 base year, instead of 2015. This target is company-wide."
"As of April 2020, we are carbon neutral for scope 1, 2, and scope 3 emissions relating to Apple's operations (employee commute and business travel) beginning in fiscal year 2021. In 2020, we also set a new goal to become carbon neutral for our entire carbon footprint by 2030. We plan to reduce emissions by 75 percent by 2030, compared to 2015 levels, through product design and engineering, energy efficiency and renewable energy, and direct emissions abatement. A science-based target aligned with 1.5° C trajectory calls for a 4.2% annual linear reduction. Since this equates to a 47% reduction over our target period, we consider our target to well-exceed the requirements for a science-based target. The Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) recently validated an emissions reduction target for Apple: 61.7 percent by 2030 relative to our 2019 emissions. This SBTi-approved target is derived from our current target—to reduce emissions by 75 percent by 2030—only with a 2019 base year, instead of 2015. This target is company-wide."

"We started to set Science Base Target and sent our application in Apr 2018. According to SBTi recommendation in 10/11/2018 as below:Scope 1 and ambition:Requirement C7 - Level of ambition: At a minimum, the target will be consistent with the level of decarbonization required to keep global temperature increase to 2°C compared to pre-industrial temperatures, though companies are encouraged to pursue greater efforts towards a 1.5° trajectory. Recommendation:Please consider erasing Abs1 target from your next submission as it is not in line with any 2°C pathway approved by SBTi. Abs1 is based on the historical average CAGR growth of emissions, thus limiting emissions in 2010% would mean ‘business as usual'. However, the ambition of the pending Abs2 target would be in line with our C7 criterion.AOI Action:The original Abs1 of Science Based Target was removed according to SBTi comment. And we sent Abs2 to SBTi for evaluation."

AOI received 2nd SBTi comments on 3/5/2019: Rationale: According to your submission form and query answers the scope 3 target addressing emissions from use of sold products cannot be considered measures to reduce emissions, but rather aspects of recalculating an overestimated base year inventory. Recommendation: Please consider using the most accurate scope 3 inventory as baseline in order to be representative of the value chain and set a target that meets at least one of the 3 options above in terms of ambition.AOI Action in 6/6/2019: AOI spent more resource to complete a most accurate scope 3 inventory calculation in FY2018.   The tCo2e of Use of Sold Product emission is more than 59% but still less than 66.6% of total Scope 3. The tCo2e of Purchased Goods and Services emission is more than 20% of total Scope 3.

"Aptargroup's target submission for scope 1 and 2 emissions is a reduction of absolute emissions 28% by 2030 from a 2019 base year, which exceeds the minimum ambition for well below 2°C pathway defined by the Absolute Contraction approach and is therefore considered ambitious.Our ABS1 target approved by SBT in target assessment report (dated January 2021) has been achieved thanks to the increase or renewable electricity usage in our operations. In fact at year end 2020, 85% of our global electricity consumption comes from renewable sources, surpassing our renewable energy target.  Market based emissions decreased 74% respect  baseline 2019. About Scope 1 in 2020 we achieved 14% reduction from baseline."
"Along year 2019 we completed Scope 3 screening in compliance with GHG Protocol Scope 3 Accounting and Reporting Standard and this Scope 3 inventory has been verified from third party certification body in compliance with ISO 14064-1. Aptargroup's target submission for scope 3 emissions is a reduction of absolute emissions 14% by 2030 from a 2019 base year, which exceeds the minimum ambition defined by the absolute contraction approach and is therefore also considered ambitious.Base year emissions calculated on 2/3 (67%) of total Scope 3 emissions (as defined by SBT regulation)"

"During 2020, we completed a greenhouse gas inventory covering emissions we control and influence and identified opportunities to improve emissions tracking. In February 2021, Aramark announced a specific climate goal as a core pillar of our sustainability plan – we've committed that by the end of 2025, we'll reduce our greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S. by 15% from our 2019 baseline, equating to a 3% year-over-year reduction over 5 years. Our ambition is in line the Science-Based Target initiative (SBTi) ambition standards and the goal of the Paris Agreement to limit global warming to well-below 2C above pre-industrial levels. As we expand our GHG inventory, within the U.S. and beyond, we continue strive toward meeting all SBTi criteria and applying for an SBT approved target in the future."
"The Abs 1 target is set for our operations in the Netherlands. In 2015, the Netherlands achieved its 2012-2015 emissions reduction goals previously set and updated its goals to 2020 to reflect a longer-term vision of continuous improvement (30% reduction compared against its 2010 baseline year for Scope 1 and 2 market based emissions). We consider this target as a science-based target as the operations has a yearly 2.72% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 (market-based emissions) which is more ambitious than the well-below 2D target for the absolute contraction for SBTi (2.5% yearly reduction). In 2016, Arcadis began assessing whether these rigorous goals aligned with science-based targets which is anticipated to continue into 2019.To date, the Netherlands achieved its goal, -48.8% reduction compared against its 2010 baseline year. The number 48,8% is taking into account an increase of 12,1% in scope 3 emissions due to measures that have been taken. E.g. one of the measures taken is promoting working from home. This results in an increase of the electricity usage at home, which falls under Arcadis' scope 3 emissions. This means that even though there is a Netto reduction in scope 2, there is still an increase in scope 3 emissions (12,1%). These effects have been taken into account when calculating the overall reduction.Please note our Dutch Organization is locally obliged to use conversion factors that are different from the dataset we use for Global. To keep reporting consistent with previous years, the target above is calculated using the Dutch -local- set of conversion factors (https://www.co2emissiefactoren.nl/). This will be updated with new targets set for 2030."
"Please note 100% of our 2020 footprint will be Offset.  The Global emissions are lower than they were in 2008.In 2019, Arcadis set a zero-carbon goal, through the purchase of offsets, by 2030. In 2020 our full Carbon Footprint will be offset through purchase of high-quality carbon offset.We note that, in line with the SBTi, our main priority is to achieve reductions through energy efficiency and elimination. The remaining emissions will be neutralized by Carbon Removal projects as of 2030, in which we start investing in 2020. In 2020, Arcadis pledged to SBTi (1.5C) and we are now developing targets for our material Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions."
"In 2020 Arcadis pledged to SBTi to reduce it's emissions in line with 1.5C science-based targets. The details of these targets (including short-, mid- and long-term milestones), are being developed and submitted to SBTi in 2021."

"In 2010, the world's governments agreed to work towards holding the average global temperature rise to below 2°C, a level deemed likely to prevent the worst effects of climate change. Thisthreshold implies a ‘carbon budget' – a total volume of greenhouse gases that can be emitted while still providing a degree of confidence that the 2°C target can be met. According to figuresfrom the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), this requires a 41- 72% reduction of global emissions by 2050. Based upon its analysis of the feasibility study summarized above, ADM has set an ambitious goal to reduce its absolute Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 25% from its 2019 baseline by 2035. This represents an annual reduction of 1.67% for 15 years. This is more aggressive than the absolute emissions contraction approach that takes into account the global carbon budget, which requires an annual reduction of 1.23% to limit global warming to two degrees Celsius.WSP and ADM have developed a plan with sufficient reductions to reach a GHG reduction target of 25% over 15 years. The projects selected to achieve the reductions include purchasing renewable electricity, increasing use of biomass fuels, transportation fleet changes, and in some locations, equipment changes.• Renewable energy and biofuels – Through the purchase of renewable electricity, ADM can significantly reduce its Scope 2 emissions. Increasing the amount of biofuels burned onsite will reduce Scope 1 emissions. ADM is moving forward with several projects to use biodiesel in its fleet of boats and trucks.• Fuel switching – In both stationary and mobile equipment, ADM has opportunities to switch to less carbon-intense fuels. Some facilities can feasibly switch to natural gas or cofire biomass in the boilers. ADM is also assessing the use of liquefied natural gas for its boat fleet and compressed natural gas for its truck fleet in certain geographies.• Energy treasure hunts – ADM has had success over the past few years conducting energy treasure hunts which identify energy efficiency and reduction opportunities across its facilities globally.Although sufficient reduction projects have been identified to achieve the 25% reduction target, as ADM implements these projects over the next 15 years, new technologies may becomeavailable that offer greater or less costly reduction opportunities."

"From a base year of 2018, we recorded a 5.55% reduction across our scope 1 & 2 location based emissions from 4,391.02 --> 4,146.93 CO2e in 2019 through efficiency initiatives across our operations including LED retrofit of our British Columbia DC (and within our store network) as well as the adoption of a Street Front Closed door policy. For 2020, we built on this, with another absolute reduction target of 5% from 2019. We met and surpassed this target by with a 17% absolute reduction. This is partially due to continuing our LED retrofit roll out, and improved processes in the implementation of our street front store door policy. However, a significant portion can be attributed to store operations closures as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in us surpassing our target. We expect that our emissions and energy consumption will increase next year aligned with the 2018 and 2019 trajectory as businesses continue to open and remain open, in addition to Aritzia's accelerated trajectory for overall business growth."
"We set a target to achieve Carbon Neutrality across our operations (scope 1 and 2) – which we met through the purchasing of offsets to cover our scope 1 emissions and Renewable Energy Credits (RECs) to cover 100% of our scope 2 market-based emissions from electricity consumption.  By purchasing RECs, with an emissions factor of 0, for 100% of electricity consumption volume, Aritzia's Scope 2 market-based emissions reduced to 0, equal to a 100% reductionThis was done for 2019 retroactively, which is why it was not reflected in our 2020 CDP Climate Change disclosure. We plan to continue to maintain Carbon Neutrality across our operations (scope 1 and 2) by purchasing RECs and offsets retroactively, which has not been completed yet which is why covered emissions in reporting year is left blank."
"As it has met its GHG reduction target ahead of time in 2018 and aims to bolster its contribution to climate issues, the Group has decided to set a new GHG emissions reduction target based on scientific knowledge. This new long-term Science- Based Target (SBT), is deemed consistent with the goal of keeping the rise in global temperatures to well below 2 °C above pre-industrial levels by the end of the century, in accordance with the Paris Agreement and recent reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).As a responsible manufacturer, Arkema includes the gases from Montreal Protocol in its direct emissions for this target, as they represent around 11 % compared to scope 1 emissions.To set this target, the methodology was based on a breakdown over time of the carbon budget in choosing a global GHG emissions scenario adapted to a trajectory well below 2 °C (2018 report of the IPCC). Next, an allocation mechanism is applied taking the approach of a contraction of absolute emissions, in line with Science Based Targets recommendations and based on a 41% to 72% reduction in GHG emissions between 2010 and 2050. For the Group, this comes out to an annual reduction in GHG emissions of 2.5% for direct and indirect GHG emissions.In July 2020, Arkema submitted a commitment letter and its targets for validation  to the SBT initiative ."
"In 2019, Arkema set Science-Based Targets (SBTs) aligned with a trajectory well below 2°C for its Scope 1 and 2 emissions and ozone-depleting substances. In 2020, it introduced SBTs for certain categories of Scope 3 emissions, thereby setting targets for its value chain in line with the Paris Agreement: • a 19% reduction in Scope 3 emissions categories 3, 4, 5 and 9 between 2015 and 2030; and• commitment from suppliers representing 82% of Scope 3, category 1 emissions to set SBTs for their Scopes 1 and 2 emissions by 2025.The Abs 2 target described above corresponds to the scope 3 categories 3, 4, 5 and 9."
"The reporting year 2020 is the target year for limiting absolute GHG emissions in accordance with the APPM's Climate Strategy, approved in 2013. The Company's voluntary commitment to limit absolute GHG (Scope 1+2) emissions (for all Company's business divisions), set by the Strategy is 2.2 million tCO2e in year.The actual value of GHG (Scope 1+2) emissions of the APPM in 2020 turned out to be equal to 1.96 million tCO2e, which is by 0.24 million tCO2e or 10.9% below the voluntary commitment value.Thus, the voluntary commitment of JSC ""Arkhangelsk PPM"" to limit absolute GHG emissions for the period up to 2020 was successfully fulfilled."
"This target was set in 2017 in the framework of the Strategy of Low-Carbon Development for the period until 2030.In the base year (2012) GHG emissions (Scope 1 + 2) were 2,095,961 tCO2e. The Company's absolute target is 1,400,000 tCO2e by 2030. Thus, target reduction from base year = (2,095,961-1,400,000)/2,095,961*100=33.2%In 2020, GHG emissions (Scope 1 + 2) were 1,959,242 tCO2e. The reduction for the reporting year 2020 = (2,095,961-1,959,242)/2,095,961*100=6.5%Thus, % of target achieved = 6.5/33.2*100=19.6%When developing Low-Carbon Development Strategy for the period up to 2030, GHG emission reduction target was defined based on 2°C scenario using the method of absolute GHG emissions reduction.We have sent Commitment Letter to SBTi to approve this target as science-based."
"This target was set in 2017 in the framework of the Strategy of Low-Carbon Development for the period until 2030.The target  was developed  for the main production site of Arkhangelsk PPM in the city of Novodvinsk. It's the largest business unit of APPM.In the base year (2015) GHG emissions (Scope 3) were 462,771 tCO2e. The Company's absolute target is 370,000 tCO2e by 2030. Thus, target reduction from base year = (462,771-370,000)/462,771*100=20.0%In 2020, GHG emissions (Scope 3) were 438,907 tCO2e. The reduction for the reporting year 2020 = (462,771-438,907)/462,771*100=5.2%Thus, % of target achieved = 5.2/20*100=25.8%"

"Arm has declared its commitment to achieving net-zero carbon emissions (to reduce absolute greenhouse gas emissions including carbon dioxide in line with a 1.5°c temperature pathway, and balance any residual emissions with carbon sequestration offsets) in its operations by 2030. Arm is seeking to achieve absolute reductions wherever possible in direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions to achieve this goal before we consider investments in offsetting initiatives.Note that we have set a net zero target for ""Scope 1 +2 (market-based) + 3 (upstream & downstream)"" but due to the time lag in the CDP Supply Chain data and the CDP disclosure we are exploring how to report on these figures so in the meantime we are reporting on ""Scope 1 + Scope 2 (market-based).This commitment was presented to the Sustainability Committee in May 2020 and discussed and approved in September 2020. It was announced internally in October 2020 and externally in December 2020. We have set individual targets across all scopes to deliver the net zero commitment.  Our net zero commitment covers scope 1, scope 2, and all scope 3 upstream emissions (only scope 3 upstream emissions are relevant to Arm). The individual targets we have set so far to meet this commitment are: 1) Switch to 100% renewable electricity by 2023 (and we have also committed to RE100 by this date) 2) reduce energy consumption by 20% 3) reduce business travel emissions by 7% 4) reduce supply chain emissions by 42%. We are collecting data to be able to to set targets in line with our net zero commitment for some other areas of our footprint eg commuting. We agreed to commit to net zero in 2020 despite some data gaps due to the urgency of the climate crisis. We  are collecting data and setting targets for lower impact area of our footprint eg commute, at the same time as we work to meet the reduction targets for the higher impact areas of our footprint in acknowledgement of this urgency ie there is no time to delay.In 2020 we began working with CDP Supply chain for the first time to measure the carbon in our supply chain. This is an exciting step forward for us and we have invited our top 500 suppliers to disclose this year for the first time. We are working to understand how we manage the lag in CDP supply chain data availability  (due December each year) with the CDP disclosure reporting deadline (July each year)."
"In 2020, the actual emission of greenhouse gases on our plant is 4835 t of CO2, which is 8% less than the base year"
"The Covid-19 pandemic resulted in an exponential and unanticipated increase in demand for core products lines, e.g. sanitiser, disinfectants and PPE. Business revenue increased by 20%, and the resulting increases to distribution, importing (as a result of global supply chain challenges), storage and goods transportation meant carbon emissions increased beyond business growth forecasts, e.g. the predicted reduction was not achieved. However,  Arrow are on-track to achieve their revised 2021 target, in line with industry and government guidance."
"Initially, the target was set in the financial year of 2013-14, in which the emissions were 853,979. The target was to reduce the emissions by 20% by 2018-19. For the same many activities were undertaken like installation of 24 MW solar rooftop, 10 MW wind power, and replacing coal with renewable biomass. In 2018-19, the emissions were 696,942.17 and a revised target was set to reduce emissions by 20% of the 2018-19 level by 2022-23. We consider this a science-based target as it is a company-wide target and it aligns with the minimum ambition thresholds required according to absolute emissions contraction methodology for reaching the long-term temperature goal of 1.5 degrees celsius. The minimum threshold required is an annual linear reduction rate of 4.2 % in absolute emission, relative to the base year i.e. 2018-19 and as per our target we aim to reduce 5% annually which aligns with the threshold to achieve 20% by 2023.Additionally, we also plan to get the science-based target validated in the upcoming two years."

"At the Management Briefing  held in May 2021, we have announced to replace our GHG emissions reduction target from an intensity target to an absolute target. We newly set our long-term GHG reduction target to become carbon neutral by 2050 and to decrease GHG emissions by more than 30% compared to 2013 levels by 2030 as a milestone."
"The base year was set to 2013 with reference to the base year of the Paris Agreement. We set the reduction target aiming to archive 26% reduction in FY2030 and conduct annual assessment to review which extent the target has been met. However, we do understand that some of the items in our scope do not comply with the SBT requirements."
"(1). This absolute reduction target was set in 2017 with the base year of 2016, covering 100% of ASEH's Scope 1+2 emissions.(2). The target is approved by SBTi in June 2021.(3).

"These are our main corporate concern in climate change and the following goals are set: 1) Emission reduction targets (quantitative): Reduce CO2 emissions associated with energy consumption by 2.5% from previous year. 2) Energy-saving targets (quantitative): Energy-saving target in the 13th Five-Year Plan period is estimated to be 328tce. Correspondingly, the comprehensive energy consumption per unit product will reach 0.5895tce/10,000 pieces in 2020, and the energy consumption per unit of total industrial output value will reach 0.0250tce/10,000 yuan.. The company has two reward projects - ID (Idea) and SPI (System and Process Improvement) which encourages every employee to come out with improvement programs in any areas and processes including energy and water saving.We set the target based on financial years. Thus, our target year is the same as the reporting year. The company set the goal for our CO2 emission reduction of our operational activities. With each responsible departments, business units and support from top management, we were able to achieved our set goal. We achieved total 2.9% GHG emission reduction in 2020 compared to base year 2018. To calculate for total % CO2e value: (47,875.10 - 49,309.18) = negative 1,434.08 / 49,309.18 x 100 = 2.9% CO2e reduction. Also, we achieved GHG emission reduction for about 1,582.74 metric tons CO2e in 2019 from implementing the completed energy-saving projects. To calculate for % CO2e value: (1,701.01 - 118.27) = 1,582.74 / 1,701.01 x 100 = 93.04% CO2e reduction. (Please refer to C6.10 for further details). These results support our commitment to address climate change. Overall, our business units and related responsible departments continuously do the efforts on improving to meet the set CO2 emission reduction goal.Energy consumption per unit output value"
"Due to a proactive approach to switching to renewable electricity contracts combined with investments in solar panels in several locations, the 2020 targets of 5% absolute CO2 emission reduction in our own operations has been achieved and exceeded ahead of schedule. 2020 emissions showed a 25% reduction compared to 2015 base year emissions."
"Due to a proactive approach to switching to renewable electricity contracts combined with investments in solar panels in several locations, we are well underway in reaching our 2030 goals for 63% reduction of CO2 emissions from direct operations.  In 2020 we decided to adjust our targets to align with the 1.5 degrees scenario in line with various commitments we made and coalitions we joined, so this target has been revised to 63% reduction instead of the previous 38% reduction. 2020 emissions showed a 25.0% reduction compared to 2015 base year emissions, amounting to achieving 39.7% of the total 2030 reduction goal for this target."

"The pursuit of climate neutral operations is part of the a.s.r. strategy. a.s.r. is actively getting to grips with waste management, mobility, energy usage and carbon emissions in order to minimise its impact on the environment. a.s.r. puts a special focus on its direct carbon footprint due to its own operations. As such the  target coverage of this target is the direct footprint. The goal to reduce direct CO2-emissions by 50% in the period 2019 - 2025 compared to the base year 2018.Regarding science-based target:Currently there is no science-based target approach available for the insurance sector. When this is the case our next step is defining SBTs for a.s.r.'s own footprint. Which we will use as input for our engagement and encouragement towards our clients / investees to set SBTs."
"Data refers to the scope of the Group Environmental Management System, which includes around 60 offices and over 350 local agencies in Austria, France, Germany, Italy, Czech Republic, Spain, Switzerland, where 45% of Group personnel work. The monitoring of environmental performance related to mobility has a wider coverage and includes 65% of Group personnel. However, there is a plan to extend the reporting scope progressively in the coming years.The implementation of the current strategy focused on the decarbonization of the Group main offices, data centers and business travel made it possible to over-achieve the objective 2020 of a 20% cut in greenhouse gas emissions against the 2013 baseline. The net 2020 reduction is also due to the limitation of work travel and the low presence of staff in the offices due to the covid-19 pandemic.The target and the results achieved in 2020 are consistent with the methodology of the science-based target initiative, absolute contraction approach, aligned to a well-below 2°C trajectory, which requires for scope 1+2 GHG emissions an absolute reduction of at least a 2.5% per year, which is equivalent to a cumulative reduction of 15% over a 6-year period (2013-2019)."

"In April 2018, AB Sugar launched its 2030 commitments, as part of its Global Mind, Local Champions sustainability framework. Global Mind, Local Champions sets out AB Sugar's global principles and priorities for how to address the emerging challenges faced across our sugar value chain. The delivery of the framework is implemented on the ground by each of the AB Sugar manufacturing businesses; AB Sugar China, Azucarera, British Sugar and Illovo Sugar Africa. AB Sugar has committed to reducing its end-to-end supply chain absolute CO2 footprints by 30% (baseline 2018) from energy fuels mix.  In this reporting year, AB Sugar completed a comprehensive baseline of each of the 2030 commitments based on current data and methodologies.  For CO2e AB Sugar developed a baseline for the end-to-end supply chain from farm to factory. The baselines have been completed by country, business, site and supply chain. The baselines have comprehensive data for scopes 1, 2 and 3 and have considerable details about AB Sugar's supply chain partners such as the growers, agricultural inputs and logistics partners. The baselines are now supporting the work to articulate the levers and projects that can help AB Sugar reach its 2030 commitments.   The baselines enable the group to create a strategy that will deliver investments and efficiency programmes that materially reduce CO2 from its energy fuels mix and drive investment in renewable energy sources.    Internally, AB Sugar has calculated the full end to end supply chain emissions and the data methodologies are aligned to specific industry and agricultural activities.  As a result of the baseline work in 2019 to 2020, the data is being rigorously interrogated and the programme is being monitored at an executive management level."
"At Assurant, we aim to identify, monitor and report our relevant energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and improve our energy and emissions intensity. At an operational level, we set a goal to reduce energy consumption by 20% by 2020 compared to a 2010 baseline. We achieved this goal in 2019, and we are currently in the process of developing a new emissions goal. In the interim, we have set a goal to continue to reduce scope 2 (location based) emissions by 2% per year."
"In 2018, Astellas has renewed the voluntary medium-term GHG emission reduction targets and Environmental Action Plan (EAP). Astellas has reduced emission from scope 1+2 by 79,594 tons-CO2 (39%) from 2015 base year and by 43,541 tons-CO2 from the previous year. Starting in April 2020, Astellas switched all electricity consumed by its three research and production facilities in Japan (Tsukuba Research Center, Tsukuba Biotechnology Research Center and Takahagi Chemistry & Technology Development Center) to hydroelectric power(The Aqua Premium plan provided by TEPCO Energy Partner, Inc.), which is free of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.  This enabled a reduction of emissions of 29,700 tons. In fiscal 2020, COVID-19 had an impact on our business activities. Activities continued for pharmaceutical development and supply at research and production bases, but significant restrictions were placed on sales activities and employees' business trips. As a result, the limitations on business activities had an impact on greenhouse gas emissions, with reduced use of vehicles for sales activities resulting in a reduction of about 7,400 tons in emissions (compared to fiscal 2019). As the pandemic is suppressed, we forecast this impact will gradually contract."
"This new target intends to renovate the ambition of ASTM to define a decarbonization strategy in line with the requirements of the Science-Based Target initiative. The target covers 100% of Group-wide Scope 1+2 emissions for the base year 2020. Through a quantitative tool implemented with the support of an expert, ASTM defined a target in line with the SBTi Well Below 2° Scenario. In absolute terms the target is to reduce Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 25% by 2030 from the base year (2020). This target trajectory is also consistent with the intermediate reduction milestone for 2025 (-13% absolute Scope 1+2 emissions) defined by ASTM as one of its strategic ESG goals. In particular, ASTM signed a long-term ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) Loan Contract (due date 2026) of € 100 million with Mediobanca linked to the achievement of environmental KPIs such as CO2 emissions into the atmosphere (Scope 1+2) and the use of electricity from renewable sources.

"In January 2020 we publicly launched our new climate strategy Ambition Zero Carbon, including the goal to be carbon negative across our entire value chain (all Scope 3 sources) by 2030, bringing forward decarbonisation plans by more than a decade. The coverage therefore, is 100% of Scope 3 emissions.  This new target supersedes our previous value chain target that was intensity based.The estimated total emissions are from the combined 15 GHG Protocol Scope 3 categories, a combination of some primary datasets (minority) and some secondary (majority). Achievement of this target will not follow a linear glidepath, there is still significant effort being invested in better calculation and understanding of our biggest Scope 3 sources, principally within Category 1 Purchased goods and services, where spend data is used to estimate the carbon emissions associated with each procurement category according to the CEDA database of emissions factors. Our Scope 3 Targets as submitted to SBTi for verification:Reduce absolute Scope 3 GHG emissions 50% by 2030 from a 2019 base year and go beyond SBTi Net Zero by 2030. Achievement will be through the following absolute, engagement, and renewable energy targets:Absolute: •C3 fuel and energy related activities, C8 upstream leased assets and C13 downstream leased asset: 80% by 2030 from a 2019 base year, with an interim target of 60% by 2025•C4 upstream transportation and distribution, C5 waste generated in operations, C6 business travel: 46% by 2030 from a 2019 base year, with an interim target of 23% by 2025•C11 use of sold products: (within AstraZeneca's inhaler portfolio) 95% by 2030 from a 2019 base year, with an interim target to launch its first next generation inhaler by 2025•C7 employee commuting and working from home, C12 end of life treatment of sold products: 46% by 2030 from a 2019 base year, with an interim target of 100% primary data by 2025Engagement:  100% of its suppliers by spend covering all relevant upstream and downstream Scope 3 categories (C1, C2, C4, C6) will have SBTs by 2030, net of any reasonable exclusions based upon:•Supplier size•Spend threshold with individual suppliers•Procurement category i.e. spend areas that are not feasible to include•Term of commitment with supplier"

"The Atlantia Group is determined to mitigate climate impact, setting itself the ambitious target of ensuring to be carbon neutral (scopes 1 and 2) by 2040, 10 years earlier than required under the Paris Climate Agreement. This will involve a major commitment, both internally, with continuous Group-wide efforts to identify technological innovations capable of changing the way we work, and in the markets in which we operate, with the adoption of green solutions to support the transition to sustainable forms of mobility (e.g., integrated mobility platforms, digital payment systems and smart mobility).This commitment to carbon neutrality will take the form of specific targets that Atlantia's subsidiaries will be expected to meet thanks to SBTi - Science Based Target initiative. In fact, in the 2nd semester of 2021, Atlantia will apply for SBTi to translate the long-term target into middle-term certified targets, which will include even a reduction target in scope 3 emissions. The targets to be certified by SBTi will have the year 2019 as baseline and a time period in line with the criteria, with a reduction target by 2030.These ambitious targets will be achieved through the following integrated steps:• by increasing companies' use of renewable energy;• by improving the energy efficiency of infrastructure;• by offsetting greenhouse gas emissions through participation in reforestation and carbon capture initiatives;• by boosting the circularity of processes through the reuse and recycling if materials.At the same time, the Group plans to invest in innovative services and enter partnerships with third parties, following the examples set by Telepass, in developing fully digital integrated mobility services."
"Since the early 2000s the Group's three airports on the French Riviera have been committed to a voluntary and ambitious initiative to reduce their carbon footprint; they have now set themselves a new challenge: to reduce CO2 emissions to zero by 2030 and to switch from offsetting their own residual emissions to removal - of not only all their own emissions, but also in part those of the planes landing at their airports.As a result, on the 15 January 2020, the Aéroports de la Côte d'Azur Group announced, 20 years ahead of its original schedule, its commitment to no longer emit a single gram of CO2 at any of its three airports. This unique pairing of the environment and the future is based on a clearly defined agenda which, with each action, and as technical opportunities become available, will be openly released to the public. In practical terms, the Group's three airports, following their own schedule and according to their own specific-characteristics, will implement various solutions to eliminate the use of fossil fuels, develop the production of solar-powered energy, support the emergence of new fuel sources or even create on-site carbon sinks to capture residual emissions or aircraft emissions.This commitment is highlighted by the Group in achieving the most stringent 3+ level certification of the independent Airport Carbon Accreditation programme, in 2016 for Nice, and in 2018 for the entire Group, thus becoming the first carbon-neutral airport group in France. This accreditation recognised efforts taken to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions directly attributable to airport management activities: emissions from buildings, ground equipment, vehicles, employees, etc. This is why, in 2019, independent calculations at Nice Côte d'Azur Airport estimated the volume of greenhouse gas emissions per passenger passing thorough the Nice terminals at around 71 grams of CO2 equivalent. This volume is four times lower than in 2012, despite the number of plane movements increasing by 3% over the same period. The Group aims to achieve the level 4 and 4+ by 2030.The planned reduction target is aligned with and contributes to the Group's extensive decarbonization roadmap that will be submitted to SBTi for approval (please refer to target Abs1)."
"On April 22, on the occasion of World Earth Day, Aeroporti di Roma announced the placement of the first Sustainability-Linked Bond, for a value of 500 million euros and with a duration of 10 years, dedicated to institutional investors.  The issue received requests for more than 5 times the offer, totalling orders for an amount of approximately 2.7 billion euros. The success of this issue follows that achieved in November 2020 with the placement of ADR's first Green Bond, and is a strong signal of recognition of the convincing sustainable strategy of the Group that manages Fiumicino and Ciampino airports, which have just obtained, first in Europe, the highest Airport Carbon Accreditation 4+ certification on the reduction of CO2 emissions.The bond issue is linked to Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) regarding the reduction of direct and indirect CO2 emissions controlled both directly by ADR and by third parties. Here the targets set for Scope 1 and 2 emissions are reported.The goals in relation to the emissions controlled directly by the Company envisage achieving zero emissions in 2030, mainly through the construction of 2 photovoltaic plants, for a total amount of 60MW, the electrification of the entire vehicle fleet and the conversion of the cogeneration plant powered by fossil fuel.The planned reduction target is aligned with and contributes to the Group's extensive decarbonization roadmap that will be submitted to SBTi for approval (please refer to target Abs1)."
"Our target for Scope 1 and 2 aligns with the SBTI absolute contraction method, with the prescribed 4.2% annual linear reduction rate over the target period.  This is in line with the 1.5 degree C long term temperature goal."

"SBT Absolute target, interim for 2021, Scopes 1, 2 and 3 (Upstream categories 3 - Energy and 6 - Business Travel).  The abbreviation L+M., meaning ""Location and Market based""  in the description is stated because we use market CFs where these are available and where they are not, we refer to location based CFs. For the many countries that we operate we are not always able to obtain market based CFs. We have included some Scope 3 upstream data, as these two categories are moderately within our control. Note that this target is achieved although the longer terms SBT (Abs2) has been replaced as Atos has migrated from a 2DS target to a new more ambitious 1.5 degree SBTs endorsed by the SBTi."

"In 2020, Atresmedia has renewed the contracts that it manages directly with the electricity supply company by changing to 100% renewable energy, except for a small part of the consumption, which is included in those supplies that it cannot manage as it is not the titleholder (premises leased for Onda Cero Radio offices). Likewise, in December 2020, the fleet of Antena 3 and La Sexta News mobile units was renewed, a large part of which were converted to electric vehicles, which has meant that 71% of the fleet is now in the ECO-CERO category."
"One of Atresmedia's long-term objectives is to become involved in projects that will bring it to the ""zero emissions"" scenario (scope 1 + 2)."
"The scope of the organization's absolute carbon emission reduction is based on the greenhouse gas inventory of ISO 14064-1, with the SBT method as the basic tool, 2018 as the base year as the internal target, and the path of absolute emissions and carbon emission reduction by 2025. The target covers manufacturing sites directly operated by AUO worldwide and was SBTi certified in July 2021."
"To implement energy conservation and carbon reduction, AUO proposed the Carbon 2020 initiative in 2015 to decrease carbon emissions by 1 million tonnes within 5 years. As of 2020, we have exceeded the target by reducing a total of 1.94 million tonnes of carbon. In particular, green procurement and operations accounted for 1.3%, green manufacturing accounted for 30%, and low carbon product design accounted for 68.7%.In terms of low product energy consumption, in light of energy star 8.0 coming into effect in 2020, it has become the biggest contributor in reducing carbon emissions by 1 million tonnes by directing product design. AUO is committed to developing products with low energy consumption, and we have established a good technical foundation in this field."
"The absolute reduction target in the medium term is primarily an energy efficiency target which has been translated into tons of CO2. In fiscal year 2013 we launched our Group wide Sustainability Strategy, which aims to reduce CO2 emissions by 100,000 t CO2 by 2022/2023 (updated in 2018 in line with the Vision 2025). The program is being implemented through concrete projects at individual sites."
"Our SBT GHG emission reduction target is aimed at reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions by 24% by 2025 and by 35% by 2030 (against a 2015 baseline). ANZ's total global Scope 1 and 2 target has been submitted to the Science Based Target Initiative (SBTi) for informal review. The SBTi confirmed that the target can be considered ‘science-based'.Our 2020 scope 1 and 2 emissions were 134,093 tCO2-e - a 36% reduction from our 2015 baseline. This reduction was driven primarily by ongoing energy and emission reduction activities across the portfolio, including:• site refurbishments that include energy-efficient fixtures and fittings;• continuous improvement in energy efficiency initiatives, such as lighting upgrades and adjustments of automated building controls within our branches and corporate offices;• consolidation of our property portfolio, including the closure of our 100 Queen Street, Melbourne office and relocation of employees to our new, energy-efficient ‘ANZ Campus', in Docklands;• continued focus on energy efficiency in our data centres; and• technology improvements enabling the removal of hardware such as desk phones."

"Australia Post set the performance reduction target in 2010 and revised the baseline in 2014 following the acquisition of the StarTrack business which had a material impact on the emissions of the group. In 2010 emissions peaked at 360,599 tonnes and by 30 June 2020 we had achieved our target. This is a 25% reduction against our target (89% of the target) and a 27.5% reduction against our 2010 peak. There are significant cost and energy savings with this transformation, working out at $15 million (AUD) each year from a cost avoidance perspective. The reduction in fuel usage represents total annual savings of around $1 million. Overall since 2010 the program has led to cost avoidance of $75m in electricity alone to the end of FY2020. During FY19 Australia Post implemented an LED lighting project at 107 sites designed to ensure that we achieved the FY2020 target.  This did occur despite the unexpected increase in electricity and fuel usage arising from COVID during FY2020.  In FY20 Australia Post has joined the Science Based Targets Initiative and publicly announce the new target in June 2021."
In June 2021 the SBTI announced the endorsement of our target which was formally approved in February 2021.
"Autajon is remain in a growth phase. This means that calculating carbon footprint is still very new for some of our facilities. We strive to assure better data reliability each year as we make progress with our methodology and train more and more people on the subject. But this also means that as the activity is growing on our sites, it requires materials and energy that will generate GHG emissions. This target covers all of our production sites and all 3 scopes."
This target covers all of Autajon's production sites and all 3 scopes.
"This target represents our annual absolute target for fiscal year 2021 as part of Autodesk's commitment to the trajectory of ANNUAL TARGETS set by our science based target methodology, the Corporate-Finance Approach to Climate-stabilizing Targets (C-FACT), through fiscal year 2021. The annual absolute target for this year was a further 2% reduction from the target for the prior year and is derived from the intensity target. A new annual target is derived each year, which translates to 45% reduction in fiscal year 2021. For more information, please see SBTi's C-FACT webpage. Autodesk has developed an approach that corporations can follow in setting targets to reduce GHG emissions. The approach calls for companies to reduce GHG emissions in line with global scientific and policy climate stabilization targets, and in proportion to companies' relative contribution to the economy, measured by gross domestic product (GDP). Autodesk has made this approach open source so that other companies can adopt and build upon it and it has been adopted by the SBTi.Please note Autodesk's 2021 fiscal year ran from February 1, 2020 through January 31, 2021."

Additionally, Autodesk set a new science?based Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions targets to reduce Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions by 50% by fiscal year 2031, compared to fiscal year 2020.  This target was developed using the absolute contraction approach and is aligned with the 1.5 degree scenario. This target is currently in the process of being reviewed by the Science Based Target Initiative.Please note Autodesk's 2021 fiscal year ran from February 1, 2020 through January 31, 2021."
"The 2014  US based  target was established on an incomplete data set of only ADP owned facilities (68) and two data centers.  Subsequent audit revealed another 87 leased locations that were not included in the original GHG Emission baseline. That said, 16 of the active locations in 2014 are now closed. The locations in scope for the 2014 targets reflect a reduction of 38% compared to the base year. We are currently assessing our Global GHG emissions targets."
"In 2016, we pledged to reduce emissions intensity from our power plants 25% by the end of 2020 compared to 2015, and to be 100% carbon neutral by the end of 2035. In 2020, AVANGRID updated its targets with a pledge to reduce Scope 1 greenhouse gas emissions intensity by 35%, from our 2015 baseline by the end of 2025 and to be Scope 1 carbon neutral by 2035."
"A continuous improvement representative target to reduce total emissions by 1% from CY2019 to CY2020 is presented. In 2020, we generated 61,885 MTCO2e GHG emissions, representing a 6% reduction from the prior year. These reductions are primarily a result of operational changes due to COVID-19 and site-specific energy efficiency and optimization initiatives.Announced in 2021, we are committed to reducing our own carbon footprint and delivering product and service solutions that support a low-carbon economy. As Avantor's first environmental sustainability target, we will reduce our scope 1 (direct) and scope 2 (indirect) emissions by 15% by 2025. We believe this aggressive reduction target against our most recent baseline (2019) demonstrates our commitment toward combating climate change. To achieve this goal, we have developed a comprehensive energy and emissions reduction road map that invests in energy efficiency and conservation projects. These initiatives will enhance and optimize our operational processes, in addition to lowering our emissions. This target serves as our initial stepping stone on our long-term environmental sustainability journey.Note: Avantor is evaluating a science-based target approach to our long-term climate strategy and targeting setting."
"Avaya adopted the ""3% Solution"" target developed by the WWF and CDP,  targeting a 3% absolute reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions each year for a total 15% reduction by 2020. Fugitive emissions and sites smaller than 400 sq. ft. are excluded from our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions and target because they are negligible, only accounting for 2% of these emissions.  As such, our target covers 98% of our total, gross global Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions."
"Avaya set a target to achieve a year-over-year absolute reduction in its total Scope 3 emissions, or a minimum of 0.01% per year."
"Our goal is to achieve at least a 3% absolute reduction year over year. By basing our approach on The 3% Solution developed by World Wildlife Fund, CDP and McKinsey & Company, we plan to cut emissions by a minimum of 26 percent by 2025."

"Avis Budget Group's 2030 emissions reduction target covers our entire company's Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions. In 2020, the impacts of COVID-19 on our company, including the reduction of vehicles in our fleet resulted in a 28% decrease in Scope 1 and 2 emissions since 2018.   Central to the execution on this target will be expected transition to predominantly electric, hybrid and/or more fuel-efficient vehicles in our fleet over the next decade.This target is based on a decarbonization pathway in the excess of the 2.5% annual decreases expected for alignment with the 2-degree level of ambition for science-based targets using the Science-Based Targets initiative's absolute-based approach."
"We have had two long term carbon reduction targets in place with a baseline of 2010.  the first one was 50% by 2020 and 70% by 2030.  By the end of 2020 we had achieved a 76% reduction.  We believe that the 70% target is science based, however we are still awaiting the SBT mandatory methodology for financial services to truly set a target for Scope 3 - investments.   Whilst Covid 19 disrupted operations during 2020, with significant drops in business travel, initiatives to reduce our emissions continued, highlighted by our installation of combined solar, energy storage and EV charging facilities at our Perth office. We are confident that we would have achieved the 70% target irrespective of the pandemic. We have now announced that our operations will be Net zero by 2030. We have also rebaselined our figures to take account of our focus on reporting our Scope 2 (market based methodology going forward) using a baseline of 2019"
As well as having a long term carbon reduction target we have a year on year absolute reduction target of 5% per annum.

More on this target by edotco, and their performance for this, can be read on page 44 of Sustainability and National Contribution Report."
Axilone Plastique has made a commitment to provide renewable electricity to the EDF operator. This objective of 2017 was concretized in 2018 by the renewal over three years of the contract with the option 100% renewable energy.Axilone metal is also in contract with a supplier of renewable electricity.Both Axilone Plastic and metal repredent 8% of the scope 2 of the group.
"Using SBTI calculation tool. Axilone is committed to a vision of 2030 to reduce its scope 1 + 2 emissions by 58.8% compared to the reference year 2016. We chose 2016 because we had our emissions certified by the CARBONE4 firm. Considering the detail of our carbon footprint, the main lever for action concerns the energy consumption of our Chinese division. Despite the increase in emissions in the first years, we are very confident in achieving the objectives because Axilone Shunhua will, like the European divisions, sign a renewable energy supply contract between 2021 and 2022 , drastically reducing scope 2 of the group."
Axilone is committed to a vision of 2030 to reduce its scope 3 emissions by 54.6 % compared to the reference year 2017. We used the SBTI calculation tool to set this goal. Axilone will engage in the SBT Initiative.

"This target relates to the Air business in the UK, who update the target annually and therefore re-baseline each year.  This fits in with the requirement on all businesses to set objectives and targets in line with their ISO 14001 (Environmental Management Systems) and /or ISO 50001 (Energy Management Systems).  This Air target has been converted from an energy reduction target to an emissions reduction target using relevant location- based emissions factors from 2020 taken from gov.uk website. Note that although the Air business target is used as an example here, all businesses set targets to improve their energy performance. These targets take various formats depending on what works most effectively for the different businesses across the Group. They could require an absolute reduction; a reduction against an informed forecast energy consumption; or a reduction calculated on the basis of the successful completion of a large programme of energy saving projects, or there may be targets to improve reporting, maintain energy systems, raise awareness, etc."
"Note : due to Covid crisis, Baikowski stopped its activity during 2 months. The actual CO2 emitted in 10 months in 2020 was 7461 MT, which corresponds to 8953 MT on a 12-months basis."
Bain had earlier set a target to reduce our Scope 1 and scope 2 emissions by 90% by 2040.  This target has been revised and we aim to achieve this by 2030. Bain includes scope 1+2 emissions from all our operations and businesses and hence we have a company-wide target coverage
"Bain had set a target to move 100% of our energy consumption to renewable sources till 2030. This target was revised to be achieved in 2021. We managed to achieve 100% (company-wide) renewable energy consumption in 2020, a year ahead of our revised target"
"As per Bain's commitment to set SBTi targets in 2020, we have set our Scopes 1 and 2 science based targets according to SBTI's absolute contraction approach. We cover all of Bain's Scope 1+2 (market based) emissions, hence setting our target coverage as company-wide. We plan on getting this target approved by SBTi in coming weeks"
"2030 50% Reduction - This goal is in alignment with the Paris Agreement, which Baker Hughes supports.  We believe that the private sector has a crucial role to play in limiting the global temperature rise to 1.5-degrees Celsius.  As our company evolved over the last several years, there have been substantial structural changes. We have reset our base year from 2012 to 2019, to provide an accurate view of our company and its emissions profile.  As we continue our journey to achieve a 50% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2030 and net-zero by 2050, a reset to 2019 also results in more aggressive mid-term targets over this decade.We reported in our 2019 Corporate Social Responsibility report a 31% reduction in operating emissions since 2012 (our prior base year) through a commitment to new technology and operational efficiencies. We will continue to employ a broad range of emissions reduction initiatives across manufacturing, supply chain, logistics, energy sourcing and generation. Our carbon emissions reporting is conducted in accordance with the World Resources Institute and World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WRI/WBCSD) Greenhouse Gas Protocol for corporations. Each year, we evaluate organizational structure changes to determine if adjustments are needed related to acquisitions or divestitures of business units. For 2019, we have restated our emissions to account for recent divestitures, to include emissions related to field activities, and to reflect changes in methodology.   This is completed in accordance with the WRI/WBCSD Greenhouse Gas Protocol base year recalculation methodology for structural changes using a fixed base year approach. In accordance with the GHG Protocol, Baker Hughes has established a base year emissions recalculation policy with a 5% cumulative Scope 1 and Scope 2 significance threshold applied to any significant change including improvements in accuracy of emissions factors or activity data, errors, inventory boundary, methods or any other relevant factors. This 5% threshold also applies to the restatement of combined Scope 1 and 2 emissions for any reporting year."
"This target has been set with a view to submit to the SBTI once scope 3 targets have been set in 2021.The progress against this target will not be linear as the target is set against a period of growth that will see output from the business double, and it relies on a number of big investments which will be made by 2030.We have listed this target as company-wide but it should be noted that the target does not currently cover emissions from  Bakkafrost's most recent acquisition of the Scottish Salmon Company. While figures given in sections below do include the Scottish Salmon Company (SSC), SSC has not yet aligned itself with Bakkafrost's GHG target. We anticipate that SSC will commit to this target within this following reporting year.  We also need to re-baseline our base year emissions to account for the acquisition and this has not yet happened."
"This absolute target, to reduce Ball's absolute Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions by 55% against a 2017 baseline, is part of Ball's approved Science-Based Targets. Between 2017 and 2020 Ball has reduced its combined Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 6.4%. However, we expect to make considerable progress on this target in the next several years based on the recent signing of four Virtual Power Purchase Agreements, two in North America and two in Europe, that will come online in 2021."
"This absolute Scope 3 target to reduce Ball's GHGs 16% against a 2017 baseline is part of its approved SBTs. This increase was anticipated because Ball updated its calculation approach to purchased metals to better align with its customers. Different methodologies exist for calculating the embedded GHG emissions of materials such as aluminum. The main difference stems from how recycling credits are being allocated for the material: 1.) A material can get the full credit for avoided emissions by only considering the amount of recycled material used when producing the material (called recycled content, cut-off, or 100:0 allocation). 2.) Or, one can argue that products – like fast moving consumer goods – should get a credit for their real end-of-life recycling rate because only a product that is recyclable and actually recycled creates environmental benefits by replacing the need for more resource and energy intensive production of virgin materials (called end-of-life recycling, substitution, or 0:100 allocation). There is no scientific consensus around which methodology is most appropriate when calculating embedded GHG emissions. Scope 3 GHG emissions from purchased metals published by Ball prior to 2020 were based on the 20:80 method and relied on industry average recycled content values published by regional aluminum trade associations, and recycling rates published by governments and – where not available - estimates based on research conducted by Ball and its partners. In 2020 Ball used the 100:0 approach because Ball has primary data (supplier-specific recycled content values) which will  more accurately account for our GHG footprint from purchased metals. Average emission factors for primary aluminum and steel are calculated by adjusting the average grid mix impact. If no specific emissions factor exists for specified tons of purchased metal from a supplier/country/site/metal, then a default figure for that country is used. Ball updated its 2017 baseline Scope 3 data to the 100:0 approach for internal SBT tracking purposes, but Ball has not yet submitted this revision to the SBTi for approval. Companies re-baseline and re-submit their SBT data every 5 years. Thus, for this reporting period Ball maintains the 2017 baseline Scope 3 data as it was first submitted to the SBTi, but the 2020 data have been updated to the 100:0 approach as described above."
"The Abs1 target refers to the total Scope1 and Scope 2 (market-based) emissions and is part of a wider goal to reduce the environmental impact of the Group, according to the new emerging European regulations in terms of GHG emissions. In fact, Banco BPM aims to reach carbon neutrality by 2023 thanks to energy efficiency, emissions reduction, and compensation. Abs1 target is company-wide and covers Scope 1 emissions from natural gas and diesel used for heating purposes, from HFC gases, from fuels used in the company's vehicle fleet, and Scope 2 (market-based) emissions from purchased district heating and purchased centralised heating. 100% of electricity purchased and consumed by Banco BPM comes from renewable sources and is certified via GOs. In perspective, Banco BPM is committed to play a leadership role not only in the low-carbon transition of the financial sector, but also in the radical change of its stakeholders' habits, in accordance with the path set by the new elected European Commission's representatives, that will lead the Continent to become carbon neutral in 2050."
"n 2020, Bradesco continued the third cycle of the Eco efficiency Master Plan (2019-2021). The new plan set part of its goals in line with scientific recommendations to limit global warming to 2°C.As there is no specific tool for the financial sector, the Organization, supported by a specialized consultancy, developed SBTs for emissions related to Air and Ground Fleet (Scope 1) and Energy consumption (Scope 2), following the model published by the International Energy Agency (IEA), in its report ''2014 Energy Technology Perspectives”.Scope 1 targets were prepared taking into account all the emitting sources that make up this scope, thus covering 100% of emissions. The elevation in Scope 1 emissions was mainly due to the 45.4% increase in fugitive emissions compared to the previous year."

In 2020, the Organization assumed the commitment to turn its energy matrix supplied by 100% renewable sources, therefore several actions were taken for the reduction of scope 2 emissions. As a result, the goal set was not only reached, but we achieved an almost total reduction of indirect emissions (99.6%)."
"We account scope 3 emissions from transport and distribution (outsourced fleet), transport of waste generated in operations, business trips and the displacement of employees on the way home-to-work. In 2019, the Bradesco Organization began the new cycle of the Eco-Efficiency Master Plan. This plan seeks to establish a series of initiatives, guidelines and goals to reduce the environmental liabilities of our operations and promote the efficient use of resources.In this cycle, in order to facilitate the monitoring and management of aspects contemplated in the Eco-Efficiency Master Plan, we set goals for consumption of inputs (gasoline, diesel, kilometers driven), or for cost reduction (transportation by taxi and transportation of values). Therefore, the 2020 target for scope 3 is specifically related to the reduction of consumption of costs with taxi transportation and transportation of values, corresponding to its representativeness in scope 3. Emissions of Employee displacement (home to work) correspond to 46% of Scope 3 emissions. In this source, there was a decrease of 35.96% in 2020 compared to 2018 (92,030.32 tCO2e in 2018) and a reduction of 39.63%, compared to the previous year (97,624.58 tCO2e in 2019), mainly due to a significant portion of employees who adopted the Remote Work regime. According to Human Resources department , only 33% of employees were working in the departments in April (that is, commuting from home to work). For the months of May to December, this percentage was 43%.Emissions related to Transportation and distribution (upstream) correspond to 46.76% of Scope 3 emissions. In this category, the sources of Emergency Transportation and Transportation of Cash were the main two, with respectively 22.51% and 12.97% of emissions. When compared to 2018, there was an increase in the category of Transport and distribution (upstream) of 21.22% (49,813.48 tCO2e in 2018), mainly due to the 63.47% increase in Emergency Transportation emissions. Compared to 2019, there was a decrease of 4.29% (63,088.79 tCO2e in 2019), mainly due to the 5.41% decrease in Emergency Transportation emissions. Business travel corresponds to a total of 4.04% of Scope 3 emissions and decreased 75.53% in 2020 compared to the previous year. Waste generated in operations corresponds to 3.20% of Scope 3 emissions and decreased 21.16% when compared to the previous year."
"As part of its environmental commitment, BCP set for Portugal environmental goals and reduction targets for 2020, namely to reduce scope 1, scope 2 and scope 3 (business travel + employee commuting) GHG emissions, by 5% in 2020, when compared to the previous year. BCP also set a goal for 2021,  proposing a reduce of 7% in GHG emissions (scope 1, scope 2 and scope 3 (business travel + employee commuting)."

"In 2019, BB set GHG emission reduction targets, using the methodology provided by the Science Based Target initiative (SBTi), without, however, subjecting them for validation by the initiative. The submission for validation by the SBTi is under study, given the need to expand the scope of reduction by the scope 3.The established target covers 100% of the emissions for scopes 1 and 2, with a 30% reduction in GHG emissions by the year 2030, based on 2018 emissions disclosed through the Public Emissions Registry website (https://www.registropublicodeemissoes.com.br/participantes/1134). The reduction targets are part of a carbon management program over Banco do Brasil's operations. In 2020, BB announced the implementation of seven solar power plants (two are already in operation) and committed to offset 100% of scope 2 emissions as of 2021, in addition to ensuring the acquisition of 90% of energy from renewable sources by 2024.It is also foreseen the continuity of water reduction and efficiency programs, energy and resources as paper."
"In 2019 Santander launched the 2019-2021 efficiency plan with new reduction targets for the period 2019–2021. These targets include a 1.93% emissions reduction in G10 countries (10 main markets where Santander operates: Germany, Poland, Spain, Portugal, UK, US, Argentina, Chile, Mexico and Brazil) from 2018 total emissions levels.This target is already achieved, as we have implemented diverse initiatives, focusing on energy savings, saving raw materials, waste reduction, emission reduction and awareness campaigns.In addition, it is worth mentioning that in 2020, we made significant progress, achieving carbon neutrality by offsetting the emissions from our operations."
"As the target ''Abs 1” was already achieved, in 2019 we set a new, more ambitious target to reduce 58% of our Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions (upstream) by 2025, compared to 2019 emission levels. To meet this target, Santander has already increased the purchase of green energy in Argentina, Brazil, Poland, Portugal and USA and has been implementing energy efficiency measures. For example, in 2020, we replaced 4,500 fluorescent lamps with LED lights in our Alhambra and Montepríncipe corporate buildings in Spain, reducing our energy consumption reduction by 400,000 kWh."
"In 2019 Santander Brazil assumed the goal of consuming only renewable energy in its entire operation by the end of 2025. This goal will be achieved through by the purchase of energy (location-mased), supported by its own Energy Trader area, and by through the leasing of power plants (market-based). The goal is monitored monthly by members of its executive comittee, through the responsible banking dashboard, and reported annually in our Annual Report. In December 2020, 47% of all its consumption was already coming from this type of energy, one growth of 23 p.p. compared to 2019."
"In order to do our part we have adhered to the Science Based Targets initiative, where we have committed to define greenhouse gas emission reduction targets that are in line with currently available climate scenarios in order to avoid an increase in global temperature above 1.5 degrees Celsius.We have taken a step by defining reduction targets for our direct and indirect (Scope 1 and 2) GHG emissions by 2024 and we will be carbon neutral in 2030 at a corporate level, including our global operations where we have operational control (Colombia, Panama, El Salvador and Guatemala).

The electricity consumption reduction from the private electricity supplier (market-based) was actually 5.11% (instead of 2%) and the relevant emissions target was achieved and trespassed, having a 551.7% reduction (23,811.88 tCO2e)."
"In 2019, we reached our goal of becoming carbon neutral for Scope 1 and 2 emissions, one year ahead of our plan. To reach this goal, we started by reducing our location-based emissions by 60% since 2010. Second, we have focused on purchasing renewable electricity in a way that supports new solar and wind. This is being done through installing onsite solar and long-term agreements for new utility and small scale solar and wind projects in the U.S. Finally, for unavoidable emissions we purchased high quality, certified carbon offsets in each region in which we operate."

"In tandem with the carbon neutrality goal, we are committing to reduce our location-based emissions by 75% by 2030."
"In 2021, we set a new target to reduce operational greenhouse gas emissions by 30% by 2030 versus a 2019 baseline using science-based approaches (Absolute Contraction), building on BMO's Carbon Neutral operations (since 2010) and matching 100% of global electricity use with renewable energy purchases (since 2020).  Although ""% of target achieved"" is over 100, we have marked target status as ""underway"" because we have not yet reached target year end of 2030.Note that due to COVID, many of our buildings were not occupied and hence emissions in the reporting year were lower than they would have been during ""normal"" operations."

In fiscal 2019, the Bank surpassed its initial target of 10% decrease in Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 2021. In 2019, the Bank set a new target of reducing its global absolute Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 25% by 2025."
"The coverage is company wide and the target is planned to be achieved by saving fuel and electricity.LEDs generally consume very low amounts of power. The statistics to look for when comparing the energy efficiency of different lighting solutions are called by one of two terms: luminous efficacy or useful lumens. These two items essentially describe the amount of light emitted per unit of power (watts) consumed by the bulb. In our experience LED lightings result in a 50% improvement in the overall energy efficiency of the building's lighting. With the work from home scheme in this pandemic situation, it is expected to support savings in terms of electricity and fuel use in order to achieve emission reduction targets target."
"In 2016 Sustainability Plan, several targets were planned, including this 12% reduction of Scope 1+2 emission. Furthermore, as part of its climate change strategy, Bankinter has defined a road map for becoming carbon neutral in 2020 that includes formulas both for the reduction of emissions through eco efficiency programmes, and for neutralisation (green energy purchase), and offsetting (indirect purchase of carbon rights for reforestation and conservation projects). Bankinter has been offsetting scope 1 emissions during several years. In case o Scope 2 emissions, from 1st July 2018, all electricity purchased in Spain comes from renewable sources, ""Green energy"". So, in 2019 all electricity consumed in Spain has been Green Energy.

"Bankinter to implement new climate change strategy https://saladecomunicacion.bankinter.com/prensa/bankinter-to-implement-new-climate-change-strategyIn 2019 Bankinter drew up a new strategy that incorporates the recommendations of the main international initiatives in this area, based on important preliminary work, and established short, medium and long-term objectives with the areas of the Bank that are most directly involved (e.g. Risks, Investment Banking, Asset Management). Also as part of its climate change strategy, Bankinter has defined a road map for becoming carbon neutral in 2020 in scopes 1 and 2,  that includes formulas for the reduction of emissions through eco-efficiency programmes, as well as their neutralisation (green energy purchase) and offsetting (indirect purchase of carbon rights for reforestation and conservation projects).Form july 2020, Bankinter is neutral in scopes 1 and 2. The bank offsets its direct emissions (derived from the consumption of fossil fuels and cooling gases) since the start of its Sustainability Plan in 2012: it joined ECODES' CeroCO2 platform, collaborating with the Amazon conversation project in Madre de Dios. Regarding indirect emissions, all the power consumed in bank facilities comes from renewable sources, in buildings and branches both in Spain (from June 2018) and in Portugal (from 1 July, 2020).https://saladecomunicacion.bankinter.com/prensa/bankinter-achieves-carbon-neutrality-and-completes-this-strategic-objective-for-2020.

"Changes in data collection and processing between the base year and the target for scope 1 and 2 emissions have introduced a bias when comparing results for the two years (2010 and 2019). Given that the methodology for calculating our carbon footprint has changed, we plan to set a new base/reference year and a new target in 2021"
"In 2020, we made significant progress towards our 80% carbon reduction commitment by 2021, achieving a 71% reduction in Group emissions against the 2018 baseline through purchase of renewable energy contracts across our operations in the UK, US continental Europe and APAC. We are procuring 74% of our operational electricity needs from renewable energy and are on track to hit our interim RE100 target of 90% by the end of 2021. In 2020, we committed to accelerating these timelines and are targeting an 80% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 emissions and to procuring 90% of our electricity from renewable sources by the end of 2021."
Energy portfolio absolute emissions will reduce by 15% by 2025.
"A Science Based Target was set in the course of 2020. This target aims at reducing all of the emissions of Barco's complete scope 1+2+3 and heavily focuses on the biggest category, i.e. use of sold products (78% in base year). Barco will focus on efficiency measures in this category which will lead to strong reductions in the years to come. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic the target has already been achieved in 2020, however this also has to do with decrease of sales."
"Following our 2018/19 financial year we set our baseline for scope 1 and set a target of 10% year on year reduction of our scope 1 emissions.  Barhale had already identified fuel to be our biggest energy source following accreditation in 2015 to ISO50001.  The target we set was a business wide target including all of our Operational Regions, depots and company offices.  The data stats shown above is our performance during our financial year of 2019/20 (July19-June20) where we were able to report a scope 1 emissions reduction of 25%, exceeding our target of 10% as a business."
"As a continuation of our Scope 1 reduction target of 10% year on year the data above is our scope 1 data for financial year 2020/21 (July 2020 - June 2021) We achieved a further 24% in CO2 scope 1 emissions compared to 2019/20 financial year and an overall 43% reduction from our baseline year 2018/19.  The above target applies to the entire operational business including operational regions, depots and company offices."
"Barilla has committed itself to further reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions engaging in two SBTi targets: scope 1 + 2 (an absolute target of 25% reduction by 2030 against 2017) and scope 3 (an intensity target of 26% reduction by 2030 against 2017).Progress is periodically monitored through a comprehensive CSR data collection exercise and declared through the yearly GYGP report.To fix the absolute target for scope 1+2, Barilla included in its GHG inventory all companies over which it has operational control – thus excluding one joint-venture company and its related production plant based in Mexico, over which Barilla has no operational control.For scope 1 emissions the primary operations and activities taken into account are:• Pasta production: thermal energy by the combustion of natural gas in industrial boilers used for pasta drying equipment, as well as for heating and sanitary uses. Where possible, a cogeneration or trigeneration plant is used. Muggia plant, that had been acquired during the reporting year (October 2020) isn't included in the emissions disclosure. It will be included in 2022, when annual data will be available.• Sauces production: thermal energy for heat treatment, pasteurization, heating and sanitary uses.• Bakery production: thermal energy by the combustion of natural gas in industrial boilers used baking in ovens, heating and sanitary uses.For scope 2 emissions the following activities have been taken into account: purchased electrical energy used for the process (e.g. dough mixers and packaging machines) and for all auxiliary production systems, such as compressed air plants, refrigeration plants, lighting, etc."
"Our Board has committed to reducing Scope 1&2 market based absolute emissions by 2025, in January 2020. All our GHG targets are based on Financial Years (1st July – 30th June) and cover England, Wales and Scotland as do our operations. Performance is a result of the national lockdown due to the impacts of COVID-19."
"In 2019, we have committed to become a net zero emissions business by 2040, covering all our Scope 1+2 (market-based) direct operations, aligned with a 1.5C scenario. This is using 2018 baseline data of 29,958 tCO2e."
"To calculate the reduction target for 2030, Barrick established the baseline emissions by including the emissions of newly acquired assets that were reported in their respective CDP disclosures for the full 2018 year (totaling 7,500,000 for the collective expanded operation). Emissions reported for 2019 include the assets acquired during the year from Newmont Corporation and the assets of Acacia Mining plc from the dates that Barrick took operational control (i.e., July and October respectively). The reported 2019 emissions are thus not directly comparable to the 2018 baseline. While Barrick's target is not formally lodged with the SBTI, it has been informed by climate science and followed the methodology of the SBTI.Throughout 2020, we continued to work to understand our emissions profile and to identify further reduction opportunities. We also updated our emissions reduction target. Our updated target is to reduce our emissions by at least 30% by 2030 against the 2018 baseline of 7,541kt CO2e per annum, with a defined interim (2025) emissions reduction target of 15%. The interim reduction target is based on feasible projects that have been identified and are being implemented, while maintaining a steady production profile. The 30% reduction target is in line with a continuing steady state production profile. Ultimately, our vision is net zero GHG emissions by 2050 achieved primarily through GHG reductions and certain offsets for hard to abate emissions."
"Barry Callebaut commits to reduce absolute Scopes 1, 2, and 3 GHG emissions 35% by 2025 from a 2018 base year. The target boundary includes biogenic emissions and removals from bioenergy feedstocks. The targets covering greenhouse gas emissions from company operations (scopes 1 and 2) are consistent with reductions required to keep warming to 1.5°C. Barry Callebaut has a financial year running from 1 September through to 31 August. The base year is therefore the financial year 2017/18 and the target year 2024/25."
"At the beginning of 2019, we set ourselves to reduce emissions by 20% compared to the previous year. and the same in the following years. 2018 was the first year in which we began measuring carbon dioxide and other emissions. we intend to do so in the coming years. we think it will be permanent. since then, we have also started to pay attention to the consumption of carbon dioxide-emitting substances and we have started to introduce measures to replace them with greener substances.  On the other hand, the level of production in our company has increased significantly.  Due to the epidemic, the works related to the planned commissioning of the photovoltaic installation were delayed. therefore, we have not achieved the total result as planned by us, which will be postponed to this year."
Reporting period underway (September 2020)
"We want to achieve CO2-neutral growth until 2030. In other words, from 2019 to 2030 we aim to maintain total greenhouse gas emissions from our production sites and our energy purchases at the 2018 level (21.9 million metric tons of CO2 equivalents) while increasing production. The target applies to our main business as a chemical company, accounting for 97% of total emissions in the base year. We excluded a small share of emissions related to the generation of steam and electricity for sale to third parties (3% of total emissions in the base year), which are not part of our core business activities and partly even driven by external factors (e.g. supply regulations in the power sector). +++ Note that this target applied in the reporting year but has been updated in 2021: Based on the most recent progress in developing low-emission and CO2-free technologies, we now want to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions worldwide by 25% until 2030 compared with 2018. Moreover, we want to achieve net zero emissions by 2050."
"We recently announced our goal to achieve carbon neutrality for our direct operations by 2040 and reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions 25% by 2030, aligned with a well-below 2? Celsius science-based target. Through 2020, we reduced our absolute GHG emissions from operations by 13.6% compared with 2015, exceeding our goal of 10%. The 2020 goal was the company's first absolute GHG emissions reduction goal. Baxter's 2015 goal (baseline 2005) was to reduce GHG emissions indexed to revenue by 45%. Baxter reduced GHG emissions by 40% indexed to revenue, an absolute decrease of 19%, from 2005 to 2015."
"In November 2019, Bayer committed itself to the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). In line with this, Bayer has developed and set itself the target ''to reduce absolute Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions by 42 % by 2029 from a 2019 base year.” Bayer achieved the status ''target set” by the SBTi in July 2020. This target aims to keep Bayer's emissions from Scope 1 and 2 in line with a global temperature raise below 1.5°C."
"In November 2019, Bayer committed itself to the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi).

"In 2018, BayWa AG developed and adopted a climate strategy. The goal is to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions of the Group's locations, company cars and own logistics by 22 per cent compared to 2017 by 2025.BayWa used the findings of the IPCC Special Report 2018 ''Global Warming of 1,5°C” and both methods and criteria (V 3.0) of the Science Based Target Initiative to model a GHG emission reduction target for Scope 1&2 that is oriented at the scientific findings about the level of decarbonization required for a maximum of 1,5°C of global warming. The BayWa Group reduced its emissions in the reporting year by 7.7% compared to the base year 2017. This means, that in the reporting year 2020, around 35% of the target to reduce its emissions by 22% until 2025 was achieved. BayWa is therefore further committed to continue reduce emissions in the coming reporting year in accordance with the targeted reduction path."
"BBVA  approved its new strategy on climate change and sustainable development in 2018.  As part of its commitment to mitigate environmental and social risks and minimize potentially negative direct and indirect impacts, this stratey included a new emission reduction target  of 68% by 2025, compared to 2015. This target covers 100%  of BBVA's scope 1 and 2 emissions, which include those that come from the direct energy consumption (fossil fuels) and from electricity consumption. More than 80% of the total gross emissions in the base year came from the electricity consumption. This means that the evolution of this indicator will be highly impacted by the use of renewable energy in our buildings. In this sense, BBVA has committed to the RE100 initiative to sourcing 100% renewable power by 2030. On the  hand, BBVA has been the first Spanish bank to commit to the Science Based Targets Initiative. After the launch of the financial institutions emissions methodology in 2020, we are committed to setting and validating the SBT within two years  from then.  The base year emissions have been recalculated from last years to exclude Chile from the global scope."
"Within the framework of its 2025 Pledge, BBVA has committed to manage environmental and social resources, minimize the potentially negative direct and indirect impact of its activity, and to source 70% of the BBVA Group's power consumption from renewable sources by 2025, and 100% by 2030. In line with this commitment, and considering that most of our CO2 emissions come from our electricty consumption, we plan to reduce by 90% our carbon footprint by 2050.  The remaining 10% correspond to those emissions that come from fossil fuels for back up systems that work in case of power outage (scope 1). Please note that the base year emissions have been recalculated from last year to exclude Chile from the global scope."
"Beginning in 2010, Beck's signing of the AIA 2030 Commitment set into motion a goal to reduce operational GHG emissions from our main offices, operations, and mobile fleet to be carbon neutral by 2030 and continue to be carbon neutral afterward. Beck continues to prioritize emissions reductions despite significant growth in our business practice. In 2016, we added mobile emissions to be included in our target.  2010 scope 1 and scope 2 emissions were 1966.23 t CO2e."
"Rational use of energy and CO2e emissions generated by its consumption are integrated into Befimmo's day-to-day management, throughout all the operational processes.

"Beiersdorf commits to reduce absolute scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions 30% by 2025 from a 2018 base year. This group-level target has been approved by SBTi in April 2020. In our consumer business segment, we have the same commitment. In Scope 1 and 2, small offices with less than 50 full-time equivalent have been excluded from the target boundary. All production sites and bigger offices are covered by this target."
"Beiersdorf commits to reduce its scope 3 emissions in its consumer business by 30% by 2025 with a base year of 2018. This includes emissions from categories of purchased goods and services, upstream transportation, business travel and investment."
Carbon dioxide emissions in five years do not exceed 50 tonnes / year
"Long term emissions reduction plan, to line up with overall plan committed to by the China government."
"Our emissions generated from shipping was reduced by more than 20% from 2018.  These reductions were due to load consolidation, shipping to a closer seaport, which reduces the less efficient rail shipping.  Our goal was to reduce shipping emissions by  6% per year from 2019 to 2030 for a total reduction is shipping of 18%.  We hope that this can be maintained and not just an aberrant year due to the Covid 19 pandemic interruptions to shipping world wide."
This is a target covers scope 1
"As the bank has undertaken numerous activities to reduce carbon emissions in the preceding decade including energy efficiency initiatives, decreased paper consumption, reduced branch operating hours and reduced business travel, the rate of emission reductions was expected to flatline with emissions anticipated to remain at around 35,000 tonnes per year of CO2e. As such a target of 35,000 tonnes per year of CO2e was adopted for F18, F19 and F20. The bank subsequently approved becoming carbon neutral under the Climate Active system and as such, this reporting year 2019/20 will form a new baseline, with an expanded range of scope 3 emissions. We have then set a target to reduce absolute emissions by 50% by 2030 from this new baseline.The above figure of 24,470 tons CO2e is using the same methodology that the 35,000 tonne figure was set for.  After adding additional scope 3 emissions as part of our carbon neutral application, the full footprint measured for 2019/20 was 42,094Net emissions are lower than these figures due to the procurement of renewable energy in some locations, a partnership with Greenfleet to plant trees to offset travel emissions and offsets purchased to attain carbon neutral status."
"Berbrand developed an efficient stakeholders engagement virtual channel: no physical travels are needed because our sales and C-level departments can reach the stakeholders (suppliers, clients and institutions) through a virtual platform. In 2020 Berbrand purchased ""greener"" vehicles, i.e., Diesel 6.2b vehicles for the sales department.The reduction in the emissions in 2020-2021 was due to the Covid-19 pandemic that gave us the opportunity to travel less and meet our stakeholders virtually through videoconferences."
"Berbrand received the ""100 GREEN A2A"" certificate, that is issued by the electricity supply company. This certificate proves that Berbrand uses only 100% renewable energies from 2020."
"In 2020 Berbrand applied for the ""GoGreen"" solution provided by DHL, its major partner for transportation and logistic services.This solution allows companies to cut their emissions up to 30% per year and allows them to monitor this reduction through a periodical report - it will be issued in August 2021 for Berbrand.Berbrand adopted the GoGreen service on specific large shipments only, that represent our major emission source. Berbrand is working with its transportation provider to implement this service on all shipments (either large or small) within 2022."
"due to the fact that scope 2 is zero it is a scope 1 target, rising amount of raw material produced"
"In 2019/20, the Berkeley Group worked with an external party to develop a science based target for Scope 1 and 2 emissions, based on modelling aligned to a 1.5 degree Celsius scenario using the Absolute Emissions Contraction Approach (ACA). The resulting draft target is to reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 50% by 2029/30 from a 2018/19 base year. The Scope 1 and 2 elements of the target relate to our direct emissions from our development sites, permanent offices, sales suites and business travel activities. Note that the science based target covers 100% of emissions from our joint ventures. Berkeley submitted the final science based target, along with one for Scope 3 emissions, to the Science Based Target Initiative in Autumn 2020 and it was approved in December 2020."
Emission reductions are consistent with the original U.S. NDC under the Paris Agreement (26-28% reduction by 2025)
The current short-term target for all Scopes is to reduce GHG emissions by 5% (= 53 tons) when compared to the emissions in 2019. Please note: The baseline 2019 has been set after the achievement of a considerable reduction of GHG emissions over the period 2001 - 2019! The base year emissions figure for this target has been calculated according to the VfU Indicators version 2018.GHG data for Scope 1+2+3: GHG emissions base year 2019 = 1064 tons. GHG emissions target 2023 = 1011 tons. GHG emissions 2020 = 1005 tons = >100% complete.
"BEKB has committed to a voluntary energy efficiency and GHG reduction target of 12% (= 86 tons) within the time span 2012-2022 in an agreement with the Swiss Economic Energy Agency, a public-private partnership in Switzerland to implement CO2 legislation. The base year emissions figure for this target has been calculated according to the VfU Indicators version 2015.GHG data for Scope 1+2: GHG emissions base year 2012 = 720 tons. GHG emissions target 2022 = 634 tons. GHG emissions 2020 = 479 tons = >100% complete."
"The current medium-term target for Scope 1 and 2 is to reduce GHG emissions by 61% from 2004 to 2022. Please note: This medium-term target includes the achievement of a considerable reduction of GHG emissions over the period 2004 - 2012, due to many actions, such as increasing energy efficiency of buildings and switching to electricity from renewable sources. The base year emissions figure for this target has been calculated according to the VfU Indicators version 2007.GHG data for Scope 1+2: GHG emissions base year 2004 = 1643 tons, GHG emissions target 2022 = 641 tons = reduction target of 1002 tons.

"BPCL is persistently working in making its operations greener and reducing its carbon footprints. BPCL refineries were given with the target to reduce Specific energy consumption (MBN)/ PAT targets by Centre for High technology (CHT), MoP&NG aligned with NDC which was achieved by both the refineries. Reduction in absolute GHG emission  for BPCL is driven by various initiatives taken by business units .  The company's continuous efforts to invest in various energy efficiency ,  conservation measures and renewable energy has helped its business units to achieve 27% reduction in GHG Emissions - (Scope 1 + Scope 2) in FY 2019-20 as compared to FY 2018-19."
"Reducing GHG emissions at our operated assets is a key component of our climate change strategy. We have set public GHG emissions reduction targets since the 1990s and regularly review them as our strategy and circumstances change.  This current five-year target, which took effect from 1 July 2017, is to maintain our total operational emissions in FY2022 at or below FY2017 levels (16.3 million tonnes CO2e, as adjusted), while we continue to grow our business. The FY2017 baseline will be adjusted for any material acquisitions and divestments based on GHG emissions at the time of the transaction and carbon offsets will be used as required.  This target covers all Scope 1 and 2 emissions based on an operational control approach in line with World Resources Institute/World Business Council for Sustainable Development guidance.The FY2017 baseline emissions provided in this CDP disclosure represents total reported emissions from both Continuing and Discontinued operations as at 30 June 2020 (please see Annual Report 2020 for details on Discontinued operations). On this basis we are meeting our target by a margin of approximately 3%. We also calculate an adjusted baseline excluding material divestments - this detail is available in our Annual Report 2020 and Climate Change Report 2020.  Our operated asset-level emissions forecasts indicate we are on track to meet our FY2022 target on this basis also, due primarily to implementation of renewable energy contracts in Chile in FY2022. More recent information on progress against this and our other targets will be available in our 2021 reporting suite (including the Annual Report), which will be available at bhp.com."
"BHP supports the aim of the Paris Agreement to limit global warming to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels, and pursue efforts to limit warming to 1.5°C. We have been active in addressing climate risks for more than two decades, and in 2017 established our long-term goal of achieving net zero operational emissions by 2050. This goal covers all Scope 1 and 2 emissions based on an operational control approach in line with World Resources Institute/World Business Council for Sustainable Development guidance. More recent information on progress against this and our targets will be available in our FY2021 reporting suite (including the Annual Report) which will be available at bhp.com."
"In July 2019, we publicly committed to establish a medium-term, science-based target in 2020 to support achievement of our long-term goal to achieve net-zero operational emissions by 2050. The target year of FY2030 provides scope for realising significant decarbonisation opportunities, while establishing a trajectory to meet our 2050 net-zero goal. It aligns with the date of many countries' nationally determined contributions (NDCs) made under the Paris Agreement. Based on the scope of these NDCs, we expect decarbonisation trends to accelerate significantly over the next decade. The baseline year of FY2020 represents the most recently completed operating year from which to measure our performance to FY2030, and we consider it to be consistent with a science-based methodology to establish a target.This target covers all scope 1 and 2 emissions based on an operational control approach in line with World Resources Institute/World Business Council for Sustainable Development guidance. The FY2030 baseline will be adjusted for any material acquisitions and divestments based on GHG emissions at the time of the transaction and carbon offsets will be used as required. More recent information on progress against this and our other targets will be available in our FY2021 reporting suite (including the Annual Report) which will be available at bhp.com."
"Target set to reduce scope 1 and 2 emissions by 4% year on year. In FY19 scope 1 & 2 emissions total was 746,925. In FY20  the total was 646,677 and in FY21 the total was 533,187. This represents a 17% reduction on our FY20 emissions and a  28% reduction on our FY19 baseline figure."
"Biffa has reduced its emissions by 70% since 2002, but aims to deliver a further 50% reduction by 2030, using the baseline of FY19. This target covers all scope 1 and 2 emissions.  An interim target of 30% reduction by 2025 has also been set. In February we signed up to the Science Based Target initiative and are currently working on a Scope 3 emissions target. We will then be submitting our Scope 1, 2 and 3 targets for verification. In addition to this, we have outlined our net zero strategy within our Annual Report 2021 and Sustainability Report 2021. This sets out our road map to achieve net zero by no later than 2050.You can read more about our Sustainability Strategy at www.biffa.co.uk/sustainability  Copies of our 2020 Sustainability Strategy ""Resourceful, Responsible"" and our 2021 Sustainability Report can be accessed using this link.You can also read our full Annual Report at www.biffa.co.uk/investors/reports/annual-report."
"% of target achieved has been calculated as follows: (100% target of 80%)* current reduction achieved Big Yellow's main strategic objectives when setting targets are to: -deliver carbon emission reduction in line with Paris Agreement and UK Net Zero goals - reduce the risk of cost to business through carbon taxation - enhance ouremployer and customer brand by providing goods and services that are desirable, efficient and sustainable. Big Yellow's two main approaches to reducing our carbon emissions are: 1. reduce energy consumption where possible: since 2012 we have invested £100'000s in LED upgrade and installing motion sensors - although our estate is now ca 85% converted, we have some remaining opportunities, which are ongoing as part of our Facilities & Maintenance programme 2. Invest in onsite renewable energy - in our case that means Solar PV. We currently have installed capacity across 28 stores, with 6 new solar PV systems installed in 2020/21. All new built stores will have Solar PV installations of ca 50kWh and potentially other technologies, such as ground/ air source heat pumps to further reduce our carbon footprint. We have also started to explore options on how to support our employees and customers to reduce their footprint: 1 store (Oxford ) offers an EV Charging pod; Manchester had a pod fitted in May 2019 and the next 4 store developments all include EV charging pods by design. Please refer to our Basis of Reporting document for full description of scope, boundaries etc. In June 2019, the UK Government has committed to setting a new target which will require the UK to bring all greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050. Big Yellow have developed a Net Renewable Energy Positive and Zero Emissions strategy in supportive of the Government's commitment. Until recently, the setting of a science-based target has been out of Big Yellow's reach, both in terms of people and financial resources. With fewer than 500 employees and one full time employee managingSustainability and CSR, signing up to the SBTi has not been a realistically achievable commitment. With the recent creation of a SBTi process for SMEs, Big Yellow is able tocommit to setting a target in the next 2 years. This initiative, targeted at smaller organisations, is very welcome. Big Yellow completed an in-depth assessment of its Scope3 impacts, in 2021."
"With Big Yellow's current emissions reduction at 58.5%, we have over-achieved our initial target. In June 2019, the UK Government  has committed to setting  a new target which will require the UK to bring all greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050. We have launched our NREP (Net Renewable Energy Positive) strategy this year, which covers our pathway to 100% Net Renewable Energy Positive and Net Zero scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2030.This aligned neatly with our TCFD work we undertook in 2020/21.  In the meantime, we continue to look  for energy reduction by interrogating sub metered  data. This interrogation will take place as part of the standing agenda of the Quarterly Environmental Committee. We set out scope on all of our metrics and targets in our yearly refreshed and externally published  'Basis of Reporting' document.Until recently, the setting of a science-based target has been out of Big Yellow's reach, both in terms of people and financial resources.

"Scope 1+2 was 10% lower than 2016 (base year), meaning that (10/59)*100=18% of the target has been achieved. The relative improvment compared to 2019 was due to improved production stability resulting in significant reduction in fuel oil consumption.The target is:By 2030 the greenhouse gas emissions from BillerudKorsnäs' production and purchased energy shall be at least 59% lower than in 2016.By 2050 the greenhouse gas emissions from BillerudKorsnäs' production and purchased energy shall be at least 74% lower than in 2016."
"Scope 3 decreased with 17% compared to 2016 (base year), meaning that (17/30)*100=58% of the target has been achieved. The increase in Scope 3 emissions compared to 2019 is due to increased emissions from transport of finished products (mainly oversea transports) and increased consumption of chemicals (both due to increased production and changes in product mix). Please not that from purchased goods (chemicals) have been restated for 2017-2019 due to a changed emissionfactor for one of the most common chemicals. This does not impact the base year emissions.The target is:By 2030 the greenhouse gas emissions from sources not owned or controlled by BillerudKorsnäs shall be at least 30% lower than in 2016. By 2050 the greenhouse gas emissions from sources not owned or controlled by BillerudKorsnäs shall be at least 70% lower than in 2016."
Compared to  base year FY18 the overall emissions from purchased electricity decreased in FY21. This was due to the fact that 157.6 million units of power was procured in FY21 was from renewable sources compared to 66 million units from renewable sources in FY18. We have achieved  very successfully more than target of 10% scope 2 emission reduction  from base year FY18 by reducing emissions by  50 % in FY21 compared to base year FY18.
"Compared to FY18 the overall scope 1 emissions from inside facility manufacturing operations is 4.42% less in FY20.  We have achieved 91% of the target of 5% scope 1 emission reduction  from base year FY18. Since we included Hyderabad and vizag site emissions for this reporting year, the additional emissions had impacted the overall reduction compared to target year 2018, where these 2 sites were not in reporting scope. We had achieved the target of 5% scope 1 emission if we take same baseline 2018 reporting scope."
"For more information, see our target on sciencebasedtargets.org.  Full wording of our target is as follows: ''Biogen commits to reduce absolute scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions 55% by 2032 and 100% by 2040 from a 2019 base year. Biogen commits that 80% of its suppliers by spend covering purchased goods and services and capital goods, will have science-based targets by 2025.The targets covering greenhouse gas emissions from company operations (scopes 1 and 2) are consistent with reductions required to keep warming to 1.5°C."""
"The premise adopted is to exclusively account for emissions from Biorigin's operations for scopes 1 and 2. Scope 3 was not accounted for. Inventory sources: fuel, electricity, industrial effluents, sugar fermentation, domestic effluents, extinguishers, air conditioning, gases (acetylene, etc.), LPG. The other sources were considered Scope 3 and were not accounted for."

Black & Veatch is committed to reducing our GHG emissions and be net zero for overall emissions by 2025 from a 2019 baseline.
"By 2023, Black & Veatch will reduce overall emissions (scope 1, 2, and 3) by 20% from a 2019 baseline."
"As an interim goal for other overall emissions targets, by 2023 Black & Veatch will reduce scope 1 and 2 emissions by 40% from a 2019 baseline"
"BlackRock committed to reducing facility location-based GHG emissions by 30% by 2020. Due to the growth and acquisition of several companies since 2014, our base year, while we have continuously reduced our emissions YOY, and our square footage footprint has increased by 35.5% and headcount by 47.1%, we achieved 106% of our target with a 35% emissions reduction in 2020 compared with the base year."
"The scope of this target is scope 1 (stationary fuel combustion, private aviation, and refrigerants) and scope 2 (purchased electricity and purchased heat) for our offices and managed data centers. For this target, we are not counting the purchase of unbundled renewable energy credits (""RECs"") towards achievement of the target."

For this target, we are not counting the purchase of unbundled RECs towards achievement of the target.  This is our long range target on our way to net zero emissions."
"The scope of this target includes air travel (98% of total business travel) as well as rail travel, rental cars and corporate housing and hotels. The first year of measurement towards this target was 2020 when the COVID19 pandemic curtailed business for most of the year. As a result, 2020 data and emissions reductions related to business travel are not representative of a normal business activity."
"In 2016, Bloomberg committed to RE100 to source 100% of Bloomberg's electricity (Scope 2 market-based calculation) from renewable sources by 2025. Achieving this target will result in a 100% reduction in Scope 2 emissions (market-based) vs. 2010 Scope 2 market-based baseline.  At end 2020, Bloomberg had sourced 49.8% of its electricity from renewable sources and had achieved a 47.2% reduction in Scope 2 market-based emissions vs. 2010 baseline emissions."
"In 2016, Bloomberg committed to RE100 to source 100% of Bloomberg's electricity (market-based calculation) from renewable sources by 2025.  Part of this target for Bloomberg is not just achieving this target in 2025 but maintaining this level of renewable energy commitment through 2050 in order to help meet the 1.5degreeC scenario. Maintaining 100% of electricity from renewable sources through 2050 will result in a 100% reduction in Scope 2 emissions (market-based) vs. 2010 Scope 2 market-based baseline.  At end 2020, Bloomberg had sourced 49.8% of its electricity from renewable sources and had achieved a 47.2% reduction in Scope 2 market-based emissions vs. 2010 baseline emissions."
"In 2020, Bloomberg set a science based target reduction for scope 1+2 market-based emissions of 80% by 2030 vs. a 2018 baseline. This target covers all scope 1+2 market-based emissions company-wide.By year-end 2020 , Bloomberg had achieved a 26.1% reduction in scope 1+2 market-based emissions vs. that 2018 baseline (32.6% of the way towards goal), but scope 2 emissions in 2020 were artificially low due to slightly lower-than-expected energy consumption at offices from low-occupancy due to the pandemic.  Long-term, our success with our RE100 goal (100% electricity from renewable sources by 2025) will dictate our ability to meet this 80% reduction in scope 1+2 emissions by 2030."
"In 2020, Bloomberg set a science based target reduction for scope 3 emissions of 20% by 2030 vs. a 2018 baseline.  This target covers all Bloomberg scope 3 emissions that exist within the company's boundary of Operational Control.  The categories this boundary currently includes are Purchased Goods, Fuel & Energy, Waste generated in operations, Business Travel and Downstream transportation & distribution.By year-end 2020 , Bloomberg had achieved a 69.4% reduction in scope 3 emissions vs. 2018 baseline, but that was due to significant reductions in business travel, our biggest scope 3 component, from pandemic implications.  Once business activities are back to normal and business travel activity approaches pre-pandemic levels, we will have a better assessment of our actual progress against this goal.In addition, for a few scope 3 emissions categories, we had never calculated emissions before committing to this science based target and were forced to estimate emissions based on secondary or tertiary data.  . As we move forward, we will work to refine these calculations and depending on the outcome, may adjust the scope 3 categories that are applicable to this target."
"BMC analysed its carbon footprint for the first time in its financial year 2021. The analysis included the entire value chain of BMC. A relevance assessment showed that six of the fifteen categories are applicable to BMC they are, purchased goods and services, fuel-and-energy related activities,  waste generated in operations, business travel, employee commuting and use of sold product. BMC has set an ambitious target where it aligned its reductions with the 1.5 degree target pathway defined by the science-based target initiative. It"
"Historically, BNY Mellon had a Scope 1 and 2 target of 40% for globally owned or controlled locations excluding Data Centers by 2020 relative to 2008. As of 2018, that goal was on track to be exceeded, with a 55% reduction relative to baseline. In 2019, BNY Mellon undertook the initiative of setting a new SBTi-based target that aligns with a well-below 2C scenario. The new target is inclusive of all global Scope 1 and 2 emissions including Data Centers."
"As part of the company's carbon neutral commitment, BNY Mellon plans to procure renewable energy for all Scope 2 electricity. In 2014, emissions from electricity made up 92% of the company's total Scope 1 and 2 market-based emissions; therefore procuring solely renewable electricity would represent a 92% reduction in emissions compared to 2014 when no renewable electricity was purchased.In 2015 and 2016, BNY Mellon purchased 290,000 MWh of Green-e Certified Renewable Energy Credits (RECs), 31,000 MWh of Guarantees of Origin (GO) and 45,000 MWh of PowerPlus Green Power to match the company's entire Scope 2 electricity use. In 2017, the company purchased 257,000 MWh of RECs, 34,000 MWh of GOs, 5,899 MWh of International Renewable Electricity Credits (I-RECs) and 35,919 MWh of PowerPlus Instruments to match BNY Mellon's entire Scope 2 electricity use. In 2018, BNY Mellon purchased 264,000 MWh of RECs, 28,500 MWh of Renewable Energy Guarantees of Origin (REGOs), 3,779 MWh of I-RECs, and 39,863 MWh of PowerPlus Instruments to match the company's entire Scope 2 electricity use. In 2019, BNY Mellon purchased 268,000 MWh of RECs, 28,185 MWh of Renewable Energy Guarantees of Origin (REGOs), 5,593 MWh of I-RECs, and 36,972 MWh of PowerPlus Instruments to match the company's entire Scope 2 electricity use. In 2020, BNY Mellon purchased 230,000 MWh of RECs, 13,061 MWh of Renewable Energy Guarantees of Origin (REGOs), 9,000 MWh of Guarantees of Origin (GOs), and 29,800 MWh of I-RECs to nearly match the company's entire Scope 2 electricity use. A small remainder (0.5%) remains in markets in which renewable energy is difficult to purchase- carbon offsets are used in those locations to cover the remaining balance, however, that is not reflected in our market based emissions here."
Target was to lower our direct emissions with 30%. The target was archived.
BOA aim to be caron neutral by 2025. We are at an early stage of this goal and exact measures will be calculated. The initial plan is to use carbon offset.

"According to our last regulatory CO2 report (scope 1) the evolution of CO2 emissions was -31% in 4 years (reduction from 2014) due to our progress actions . The major CO2 emissions are due to direct mobile combustion sources (vehicles). The target is to reduce this part of emissions. In 2020 due to sanitary crisis few travels were performed. It explains that results are better than the target (143% achieved). But for the future new ways of Teams meetings organization will be maintened and people are aware about our new travel policy : travel optimization (only if necessary) and mainly by train , Our new car policy is also in place to buy only hydric or electric for new company cars and electric ones for utility vehicles."
"CO2 indirect emissions due to electricity consumption are not very  important comparing with direct emissions but our goal is to be committed to undertaking joint actions to reduce energy consumptions and losses. In 2019 the amount of CO2 retated to electricity consumptions is 66t, a decrease of 22% compared to 2014. In 2020 the aim has been met and even exceeded due to actions related to progressive relamping, employee awareness on energy savings and also teleworking due to the sanitary crisis."
"CO2 emissions due to our business travels are very important. Our activity is mainly to manage turnkey projects all over the world so the business travels from our business developpers or project managers are permanent. Our objective is to promote train for short travels instead of cars or air travels and using of visio conferences or skype meeting when possible.  The % of kilometers by train for short travels is 88%. Our car policy promote also electric or hybride cars and for 2020, business travels are reduced this year . For 2020 the measures of emissions due to train or air travels are not available from our partners, they are not representative because a few business travels were performed especially international ones."
"The 25 percent GHG target is set for the large majority of Boeing's manufacturing facility operations, accounting for roughly 70 percent of Boeing's global Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions inventory.  This target was developed using SBTi Sector-based approach in effect at the time we set our targets."
"This target is based on our energy usage as provided by our local electric company, PGE."
"As a global player in transport and logistics, Bolloré Logistics has an important role to play to fight against climate change, that is the reason why the Bolloré Group started to define emissions targets for this specific division. Moreover, Bolloré Logistics represents 31% of the greenhouse gas emissions (scope 1&2) of the Group.  Regarding its climate strategy, and with a view to contributing to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, Bolloré Logistics division has drawn on the Science-Based Targets Initiative (SBT) to bring its target in line with the 2°C threshold. As a result, the Company is committed to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 43% for scopes 1 and 2 in absolute terms by 2027 for the whole of its network (baseline 2017). As a member of the Clean Cargo Working Group and EcoTransIT World, we aim, together with our partners and suppliers, at contributing to industry developments as required, in particular through any available tool and technology conducive to achieving a more responsible supply chain. With some of them, we have been working on long-term projects to bring about tangible and efficient reductions of greenhouse gas emissions and improvement of air quality.Analyzing environmental and social risks, anticipating change while integrating current and future customer's concerns are central to Bolloré Logistics' strategy. The launch of the ""Powering Sustainable Logistics"" Program demonstrates Bolloré Logistics' will to place sustainable development and CSR centre stage of its operational model. Also, it expresses a far-reaching commitment and a genuine wish on our part to join in with those at the forefront of environmental and social value creation through our worldwide supply chain activities. The ''Powering Sustainable Logistics” Program sets 54 targets to be achieved by 2025. They are translated in an action plan deployed per department (real estate, procurement, QHSE, commercial offering ...) but also at local level in each region in which the company operates."
"Bolloré Logistics division has set up a new objective in 2020 for downstream scope 3 emissions aligned with well-below 2 degrees using sectoral SBT methodology. Downstream scope 3 corresponds to indirect emissions linked with transport execution i.e. 52% of the total carbon footprint of the Group.The provision of transport services causes significant greenhouse gas emissions and air pollutants. While these are mostly indirect emissions from scope 3 downstream, the company has identified this as a major issue. Identified as a risk, it is also a growing opportunity to stand out on markets. GHG emissions from building (warehouses and offices) operations are also overed in the action plans. The same is true for emissions from our own vehicle fleet, which nonetheless accounts for less than 8% of the total volume of goods transported by Bolloré Logistics. Between 2019 and 2017, the emissions decreased by 18,6% due to actions of reduction implemented such as reinforcement of low carbon transport plan support for our customers, training for sales, carbon pacts, new industrialized decision making tools, ad-hoc team working on sustainable innovations within our B.Lab."

"In 2018 we've committed to reduce absolute scope 1 and 2 CO2e emissions by 30% by 2030 against 2017 baseline. The target was approved by SBTi in Apr 2019. In 2019 we accelerated the target committing to achieve it by as early as 2025, and in 2020 we've stretched the target even more aiming to reduce absolute scope 1 and 2 CO2e emissions by 50% by 2025 against 2017 baseline. In 2020 we have achieved a 37.4% absolute reduction in our Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions across all our operations vs 2017 baseline, with improvements driven by renewable energy (mostly through more renewable electricity purchases, but also via renewable energy on site generation) and energy efficiency projects as well as changes in footprint in some markets. Further, this was driven by lower production output and effect of Covid-19 related restrictions that led to temporary shutdowns at a few factories and reduced use of fleet vehicles for trade marketing activities. % of target achievement is calculated as follows: (864 257 - 540 864) / (864 257 - 432 129) = 75% In 2021 BAT commenced the process of redefining aggregated Scope 1 and Scope 2 as well Scope 3 CO2e targets to ensure that they are aligned with the 1.5-degree trajectory and is planning to submit these to SBTi for approval."

"Our target is to reduce  scope 1 &2 emissions across our portfolio by 51% by 2030 compared with 2020.  This primarily relates to energy consumption for the common parts and shared services of our assets.Our SBTs coverage includes all directly managed assets, all assets managed by a third party on behalf of British Land, and all new developments including residential assets and those with Fully Repairing and Insuring (FRI) leases. Coverage excludes all assets not managed by British Land with an FRI lease, although these will be included when leases end and the assets return to the portfolio. Current residential assets are also excluded, as they are either due to be sold or are on long leases. These assets are excluded as British Land has limited control and influence over their performance."
"Britvic's financial year runs from October to September - all targets and data refer to these periods, i.e. 2020 refers to October 2019 - September 2020In 2019  we were proud to commit to setting a science-based emissions reduction target to ensure that our carbon strategy reflected  the ambition and urgency required to keep global temperature rise to within 1.5°C. We have targeted an overall absolute reduction of 36% vs 2017 by 2025.  This involves us reducing our scope 1 & 2 emissions by 50% and our scope 3 emissions by 35%. We also pledged to become net zero carbon by 2050.  To set this target, we completed a full value chain analysis including engaging with over 300 suppliers to understand their current carbon impact and programmes in place to reduce it. This baseline data set has enabled us to identify hotspot areas and develop projects that will have the biggest impact on reducing our indirect emissions footprint. Going forward, this information will aid us to better measure and understand the climate change risk in our key supply chains, as we step towards incorporating the recommendations of the Taskforce on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures. The specific target coverage includes all scope 1 & 2 emissions.  Due to the initiatives we have made since our baseline year Britvic has achieved 50.6% of the target. Reductions measures such as continued purchase of  100% renewable electricity at all of our sites in the UK, Ireland and Brazil (accounting for 46.6% overall energy usage) partially contributed to the scope 1 and 2 emissions reduction seen in 2020 . We also expect our French business unit to start using 100% renewable electricity from 2021.  Additionally, hybrid and electric vehicles in our GB company car fleet increased from 27% to 43% during the year. In 2020, we also benefited from the full-year carbon reduction from the biomass boiler installed at our Araguari plant in Brazil last year."
"Britvic's financial year runs from October to September - all targets and data refer to these periods, i.e. 2020 refers to October 2019 - September 2020In 2019  we were proud to commit to setting a science-based emissions reduction target to ensure that our carbon strategy reflected  the ambition and urgency required to keep global temperature rise to within 1.5°C. We have targeted an overall absolute reduction of 36% vs 2017 by 2025.  This involves us reducing our scope 1 & 2 emissions by 50% and our scope 3 emissions by 35%. We also pledged to become net zero carbon by 2050.To set this target, we completed a full value chain analysis including engaging with over 300 suppliers to understand their current carbon impact and programmes in place to reduce it. This baseline data set has enabled us to identify hotspot areas and develop projects that will have the biggest impact on reducing our indirect emissions footprint. Going forward, this information will aid us to better measure and understand the climate change risk in our key supply chains, as we step towards incorporating the recommendations of the Taskforce on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures. The target coverage includes all scope 1 & 2 emissions and over 90% of over scope 3 emissions. The  second year of scope 3 emissions inventory analysis is currently being carried out with completion expected by middle of  2021 . The scope 3 emissions reported in FY20  is 730,108 tonnes of CO2e and reflects a combination of 2017 baseline  carbon data and the latest data for categories that we were able to update since setting our SBTs  in 2019."
"In late 2013/early 2014 Broadridge launched several additional, significant energy use reduction/energy efficiency projects.  Based on those new initiatives, and other energy saving programs implemented previously by Broadridge, in late 2014 Broadridge decided to make a voluntary commitment to reduce GHG emissions and emissions intensity.  The details of that GHG reduction target commitment are as follows:  by the end of 2020, Broadridge will reduce its Scope 1 + Scope 2 emissions total by 7.5% from its 2013 baseline emissions level, on an absolute GHG emissions basis.  Also by the end of 2020, Broadridge will reduce its Scope 1 + Scope 2 total GHG emissions intensity by 30% from its 2013 baseline emissions levels, on an intensity basis of total Scope 1 + Scope 2 GHG emissions per $ Million of revenue.  After the first six (6) years of this seven (7) year target commitment program, Broadridge's performance progress as of this 2019 CDP report has achieved the absolute GHG emissions reduction target commitment ahead of schedule, with an absolute emissions reduction of 24.2% from 2013 to 2019.  This target's early achievement was due primarily to implementation of numerous energy efficiency and energy use reduction projects over the last 6 years; corporate streamlining/operational efficiency improvements from consolidating major printing operations after a large acquisition made at the beginning of 2017; and closing a captive Broadridge data center in FY2018 and shifting those operations to an existing contracted data host.  Based on this performance success, in FY2020 Broadridge evaluated options for setting a new, long-term GHG emissions reduction target, as part of its expanding program for climate change and carbon management.  The details of Broadridge's new target are a 15% reduction in total Scope 1 + Scope 2 (market-based) GHG emissions by the end of 2025, from a 2019 base year's Scope 1+2 baseline emissions level."

"This target was developed using the 3% Solution method from CDP and WWF. This target is listed on the We Mean Business list of companies ''committed to adopt science based targets.”We established this absolute emissions reduction target in calendar 2014. This science based target consists of Scope 1+ 2 emissions, and our emissions from business travel (Scope 3). While we have realized reductions over the time period due to projects such as fuel switching, the increased growth of business and its associated emissions have resulted in small increases to our emissions annually, so we have not realized progress against the goal.Brown-Forman's 30MW wind PPA, which was signed in FY 2018 and came online in FY 2020, will be a significant part of reducing our absolute greenhouse gases over the remaining target period. Additionally, we are evaluating the potential of setting a new target which directly aligns with the science-based methodology identified by the Science-Based Target initiative (SBTi)."
"Havíamos estabelecido uma meta de 5% ao ano para redução na emissão de carbono provocada por viagens de negócios. Tivemos uma redução de aproximadamente 80,93% , muito além da meta estabelecida. A redução foi do patamar de 107,8 tonelada de CO2e no ano de 2019 para 20,57 toneladas de CO2e de escopo 3 no ano de 2020 devido à drástica redução nas viagens de negócios realizadas pela Companhia. Isso ocorreu em função da companhia ter aderido a atuação 100% home office e não ter ocorrido nenhuma viagem de negócios a partir de abril de 2020. As reuniões passaram a ser virtuais."
"Our target is to reduce the carbon emissions associated with our supply chain (GHGP Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard categories 1 through 8) by 42% by 31 March 2031 against a 2017 baseline. This target was revised in June 2020 from a 29% reduction to a 42% reduction, in line with 1.5?C scenarios. In 2020/21 we achieved a 19% cut in supplier carbon emissions since 2016/17."
"At the global level, AB InBev has a set of science-based targets approved by the Science-Based Targets initiative. Although our specific APAC decarbonization targets have not been approved by the Science-Based Targets initiative, they are in line with the method and scenarios adopted when developing the global targets. As such, we consider our target science-based. As part of AB InBev, we are also contributing to the global- and group-level science-based target. In particular, our target covers the APAC region, including operations across China, India, Korea and Vietnam."
"Our goal of reducing CO² emissions is based on the European Climate Protection Law. The target is to save 30% CO² from 2019 - 2025, i.e. 6% every year. Due to the corona pandemic, more Scope 1 and Scope 2 savings were achieved in 2020 through short-time work, home office, etc."
"Burberry currently has two climate goals approved by the Science Based Target initiative (SBTi): to reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 95% by 2022 and absolute Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions by 30% by 2030 (all from a 2016 base year). The Scope 1 and 2 target focuses on emissions from Burberry's direct operations (including electricity and gas consumption at stores, offices, internal manufacturing and distribution sites) and are consistent with reductions required to keep warming to 1.5°C, the most ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement. While the Scope 3 target relates to indirect emissions in the extended supply chain (which includes the impact from the sourcing of raw materials and manufacturing of finished goods as well as waste and business travel). In FY2020/21, Burberry announced its commitment to be Climate Positive by 2040 and achieve net-zero emissions in the same timeframe. Pending certification by the Science Based Targets Initiative, Burberry is accelerating its ambition to reduce emissions across its extended supply chain, updating its reduction target for Scope 3 emissions to 46% (from the previous target of 30%) by 2030. This means all of Burberry's Science Based Targets will be aligned to the 1.5°C pathway set out in the Paris Agreement.To date, Burberry has reduced its Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 84% compared to FY 2016/17."

"Coverage is for emissions from Scope 1 and 2 activity at our 2 largest production sites (Clonmel and Wellpark). The target contributes towards our overall target to be carbon neutral business by 2050. We have progressed with emissions reduction work at both sites during the reporting year. Last reporting year we were able to certify 100% of electricity supplied to Clonmel from renewable sources, which led to the 10% market-based target being met earlier than planned. The current reporting year emissions show a further drop, due to a mix of further investments, operational changes and also Covid-related factors, and we will continue to monitor against this target to ensure that it remains met in future years. We also have further actions planned which will lead to further reductions in future years towards carbon neutrality commitment, including inclusion of certified renewable electricity at Wellpark from April 2021. In June 2021, the Group CEO formally signed up to the Science-Based Targets Initiative, committing to set science-based emissions targets and submit them for validation within 24 months."
We are pleased to announce a greenhouse gas reduction target of 15% by 2025 over our 2019 baseline emissions. The goal covers Scope 1 and 2 emissions for all of our owned and leased properties and is informed by the Science Based Targets Initiative and the 2 degree Celsius scenario.

"Target coverage: Activity in Portugal. CGD has been developing several measures to improve its environmental performance and, consequently, reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The objective of reducing greenhouse gas emissions was defined taking into account the analysis of one of the main international trends in this area, the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). As such, a simulation was carried out based on the SBTi methodology of sectorial decarbonization ''Service Buildings”, as one of the most suitable methodologies available given the nature of the activities developed.According to the tool's simulation, CGD SA would have to reduce 38% of total GHG emissions (scopes 1 and 2) by 2021, compared to 2015. CGD aspires to be a leader in terms of climate action in the financial system by defining, for this purpose, a more ambitious reduction objective than the one presented by the aforementioned tool, in order to boost the development of projects aimed at reducing GHG emissions. In this way, a level of five percentage points higher than the value simulated by the SBTi tool was assumed, corresponding to a reduction target of 43% of the total GHG emissions of CGD S.A. (Scope 1 and 2) by 2021, compared to 2015.CGD assumed also the Business Ambition for 1.5ºC commitment, having publicly committed to aligning its business plans to promote the decarbonisation of the economy with the ambition to limit warming to 1.5ºC. CGD is currently measuring scope 3 issues related to the investment portfolio. In the second stage of this project, CGD will:1) define a plan for continuous improvement of the carbon footprint will be established, which will include procedures for collecting information on specific data on assets funded by CGD,2) broadening the scope of the calculation of emissions to other products/sectors;3) setting of Scope 1, 2 and 3 carbon footprint reduction targets, taking into consideration the guidelines from Science-Based Targets for the financial sector."
"This mid-term target covers the 100% of CaixaBank's  scope 1+2 emissions and aims at reducing 29% of these emissions through hiring 100% of the new energy contracts with renewable energy.This target is related to CaixaBank's policy of having 100% of new energy contracts hired with renewable energy, which in reality means that over 99% of CaixaBank's energy is hired with green energy. The nature of the business, which includes the opening and closure of several offices a year (inheriting old electrical contracts) accounts for the <1% left out of the target. In the reporting year, for example, 99,34% of the electricity consumption came from renewable sources. This target is part of the RE100 initiative (regarding scope 2 emissions). It aims at reducing at least 29% of the emissions in scope 1+ 2 from 2009 by hiring all new contracts with renewable energy, as well as by implementing scope 1 emission reduction activities. This target meets the 2.1% year-on-year emission reduction between base year and target year. Even though the target of hiring 100% of the new energy contracts with renewable energy is included in CaixaBank's Environmental Plan, which has a timeframe of 2019-2021, CaixaBank's goal is to maintain this target beyond 2020 once it has been achieved and commits to keep hiring 100% of the new energy contracts with renewable energy until 2025 and further (see target Abs2). This is a mid-term target (2025) and CaixaBank has already succeeded in hiring 100% of its new energy contracts with renewable contracts, which means having over 99% of its electricity produced by renewable energy.This is not a Science based target since CaixaBank is a financial institution and the new SBTi guidance for financial institutions was only published in Abril 2021.

"The design and permit of the CalCapture carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) system at Elk Hills by 2030 would, if permitted, funded and installed, reduce CRC's statewide GHG emissions by 30% below our 2013 baseline, reduce the carbon intensity of the project's oil by 50%, and put the Elk Hills Power Plant on a path to serve as a carbon neutral source of base-load electricity for California. This goal involves a significant multi-year effort to design a complex and integrated CCS system with a capacity to achieve the absolute reduction target. Installation of the system and achieving the desired GHG reduction would be subject to the company's liquidity and its VCI investment threshold, as well as securing funding commitments and permits. The Elk Hills Field is California's largest in-state supplier of natural gas, providing over half of California's in-state natural gas production. The 550-MW Elk Hills Power Plant generates electricity from local natural gas to power the Elk Hills Field and surrounding fields and supply enough surplus electricity to a local utility and California's electric grid, increasing energy efficiency and reducing air emissions. CRC's 2030 Carbon Sustainability Goal aims to make Elk Hills a model of long-term CCS that can be applied in other oil and gas formations at Elk Hills and other fields CRC operates. CRC has a dedicated Enhanced Oil Recovery and CCS team that is designing the CalCapture system to collect CO2 from the Elk Hills Power Plant and inject it into underground oil and natural gas formations at Elk Hills for enhanced oil recovery and long-term carbon sequestration. A Front-End Engineering Design Study was conducted by the Electric Power Research Institute and Fluor Corporation. The Study was selected by the U.S. Department of Energy in 2019 to receive financial support, and the study is fully funded and scheduled for completion in the fourth quarter of 2020. Several oil and gas formations at Elk Hills have already been identified as strong candidates for CO2 enhanced oil recovery. Under this process, the CO2 sweeps oil from the pore space in the formation to producing wells, permanently trapping a significant quantity of the injected CO2 in the pore space. At the surface, the remaining CO2 is separated from the oil and recycled for injection in a closed loop, supplemented by additional CO2 from the power plant."
"We used the SBTi guidance to set our scope 1 and 2 target and that is why we consider it to be science-based, although we understand that we need to update this target and add a scope 3 goal, which is in part, why we committed to setting a SBT in October 2020."
Canada Post commits to reduce absolute scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 30% by 2030 from a 2019 base year.
"Our target is to reduce GHG emissions from our buildings by 22% by 2022, against a 2011 baseline. This target covers Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3 (Category 3, Category 8, Category 13, and Category 14) . The percentage of emissions noted above excludes mobile emission sources in scope 1 (CTC & PartSource fleet) which are covered in our transportation target discussed below in Abs 2. Emissions from buildings that are owned and operated by CTC are classified as Scope 1 and Scope 2. Emissions from buildings that are leased by CTC are classified as Scope 3: upstream leased assets. Emissions from buildings operated by CTC's franchisees and agents are classified as Scope 3: franchises. Emissions from investment properties operated by CTC's tenants are classified as Scope 3: downstream leased assets. The target covers 100% of CTC's emissions from buildings and operations, with the exception of Helly Hansen and Party city locations, which have been excluded due to recent acquisition.We consider this a science-based target as we considered the Sectoral Decarbonization Approach (SDA) and the Buildings sector's carbon budget and contribution to achieving a 2-degree C scenario world while setting the target. The 22% target is in fact more ambitious than what is required using the SDA methodology."
"Our target is to keep emissions from transportation flat against 2011 by 2022, despite expected growth in e-commerce and home delivery. This target presently covers Scope 3: upstream transportation and distribution emissions, mobile emission sources in Scope 1, and Scope 3: Downstream transportation and distribution. The target covers all of CTC's emissions from product transportation, with the exception of Helly Hansen and Party City product transportation, which have been excluded due to recent acquisition. In 2020, emissions in the reporting year increased over our 2011 baseline primarily due to increased eCommerce volume as a result of COVID-19 lockdowns and business growth at our Canadian Tire Retail banner,"
"In addition to our Science Based Target, we have also produced a Net Zero Carbon Pathway, where we have stated we are targeting net zero carbon by 2030.  The Science Based Target covers our Scope 1 + 2 emissions, as well as tenants in buildings that are owned by us (downstream leased assets). CWG have selected a market-based approach for this Science Based Target in order to drive the provision of renewable electricity with our tenants.  This target has been approved by the Science Based Targets initiative.  CWG has also set a supply chain target as part of our SBT: Canary Wharf Group Plc commits that 60% of its suppliers by emissions covering purchased goods & services will have science-based targets by 2025."
"The goal is to reduce Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions at Canon Group sites by 1.2% from the previous year. It has been held every year since 2008. Canon created the Energy Cost Reduction Working Group in 2014 as a horizontally integrated organization to take Group-wide action on reducing energy consumption. The group has worked to reduce energy consumption by undertaking a thorough-going review of operating conditions at production facilities, for instance by cutting out excess use of pressurized air and cooling water and adjusting air conditioner settings. Since the launch of this initiative, it has resulted in a Group-wide energy saving of  155,086kL (crude oil equivalent).  In 2020, thanks to a rigorous program of energy conservation measures across operational sites in Japan and overseas, we achieved a year-on-year reduction in Scope1 + Scope2 emissions of 101kt-CO2 to 940 kt-CO2."
"Canon takes account of environmental impacts at each stage of the product lifecycle and works to reduce them. This applies not just to our own development, production and marketing activities but also includes the production of raw materials and components by suppliers, the transport of products to retail outlets, and even customer use, disposal and recycling. To gauge our progress in reducing these impacts over the entire product lifecycle, we convert each type of environmental impact to CO2 equivalents, and, using these as benchmarks, we set an overall goal for our Canon Group's Environmental Targets. This enables us to use a single integrated index figure to monitor progress across the full range of environmental activities, from the development of more lightweight, more compact products and more efficient logistics operations to energy-saving initiatives at production sites, development of products that are energy-saving during utilization, and more effective product recycling."
"We aim to reduce our absolute scope 1 and 2  emissions by 80% by 2030. This target is part of our science based target, the other components are: 1.

"The target coverage is 100% of Scope 1 and 2 emissions. This target is aims to drive a reduction in resource usage resulting in lower GHG emissions impact. This target is not a science-based target, however setting a science-based target will form part of the development of Capco's pathway to be Net Zero Carbon by 2030."
"Capital One has a goal to reduce all Scope 1 emissions by 50% by 2030. This goal encompasses enterprise-wide Scope 1 emissions. We are working to reduce our emissions by 2030 largely through efficiency projects. In 2020, we no longer have any offices using Propane which also helps reduce our emissions from baseline year. The baseline number may change as our data continues to become more accurate.We are working to reduce our Scope 2 market-based emissions to zero. We have addressed this through RECs for all electricity and are working to address the remaining emissions (578 MT for 2020), resulting from our steam usage, by 2030."
"Our Scope 3 goal is to reduce our emissions for categories 1-14 by 50% by 2030 (please note, not all emission categories apply to Capital One, as noted in C6.5). Both our baseline and our emissions in the reporting year do not include a portion of our Purchased Goods and Services due to incomplete data, and concerns surrounding data quality. We estimate that this number is about 40% of our anticipated total Scope 3 emissions. We expect to refine our target and baseline as our data quality improves, particularly in the category of Purchased Goods & Services, as we continue to participate in the CDP Supply Chain program and engage with suppliers."
"Capital Power has committed to reduce Scope 1 CO2 emissions by 10% from 2005 levels by 2030, based on our 2019 fleet."
"In 2020, Capital Power set a target to reduce the Scope 1 emissions at our Genesee facility by 50% by 2030 compared to a 2005 baseline. Capital Power has committed to cease coal-related emissions from Genesee 1-3 by the end of 2023. We expect to see a 100% reduction in emissions from coal generation in Alberta and a reduction of at least 50% in CO2 emissions from the current Alberta coal power plant electricity generation."
"We have become the world's first zero-carbon company to have our climate goal – to maintain zero operational (Scope 1&2) emissions and dramatically cut (Scope 3) value chain emissions by 2030, approved by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi).We have maintained 0 Scope 1&2 emissions so are on track to achieve our approved SBT in 2030.We have committed to the following:• Carbon Intelligence commits to maintain zero absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by not consuming fuels and continuing to use electricity from renewable sources through 2030.• Carbon Intelligence commits to reduce Scope 3 GHG emissions from purchased goods and services by 65% per million GBP (British pounds) added value and by 40% from business travel per passenger-km by 2030 from a 2017 base year.• Carbon Intelligence commits that 30% of its suppliers by spend covering purchased goods & services will set science-based Scope 1 and 2 targets by 2030.To support in the achievement of our SBT, we have established ‘Project Spotlight'; our internal engagement initiative. Project Spotlight is responsible for calculating and reporting on our GHG footprint, reporting progress against our SBT, and implementing and running initiatives throughout the reporting period to keep staff engaged in emissions reductions. This team is made up of individuals from across the business and has an executive-level sponsor to ensure there is both top-down and bottom-up engagement on climate-related issues throughout the organisation."
"Building on nearly 20 years of climate action, Cargill has committed to reduce absolute greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in our operations by a minimum of 10% by 2025, against a 2017 baseline. That means that even as our business grows, our emissions will shrink. Cargill's commitment is aligned with science-based targets, which are intended to keep the global rise in temperature below 2 degrees Celsius, and encompasses emissions in our operations, known as Scope 1 and 2 emissions. The target has been approved by the Science Based Target Initiative."
"Our target is to make our own operations carbon neutral (net zero emissions) by 2030, which goes beyond the required ambition level of the Science Based Targets initiative.  Under the SBTi, the target wording is: ""Cargotec commits to reduce absolute scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions 50% by 2030 from a 2019 base year. The target boundary includes biogenic emissions and removals from bioenergy feedstocks. The targets covering greenhouse gas emissions from company operations (scopes 1 and 2) are consistent with reductions required to keep warming to 1.5°C.""We aim to reduce the emissions as far as possible (at least 50% as approved by the SBTi) but acknowledge that reaching carbon neutrality may require neutralising the remaining share of emissions that cannot be mitigated."
"This target covers scope 3 categories: 1) Purchased goods and services and 2) Use of sold products. The purchased goods and services cover only the direct sourcing while the indirect procurement is excluded. The use of sold products covers all emissions in that category.  Altogether, the emissions covered within this target do not include only around 4 % of emissions related to those two scope 3 emission categories (i.e. purchased goods and services and use of sold products) which relate to indirect procurement, hence the 96% coverage. Moreover, these two categories comprise 94% of total scope 3 emissions in the base year. Under the SBTi, the target wording is: ""Cargotec commits to reduce absolute scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions 50% by 2030 from a 2019 base year. The target boundary includes biogenic emissions and removals from bioenergy feedstocks. The targets covering greenhouse gas emissions from company operations (scopes 1 and 2) are consistent with reductions required to keep warming to 1.5°C."""
"This target aims at a reduction of CO2-emissions for Scope 1 and 2 of around 70% by 2022 compared to 2019. Until 2022 the target acts as an interim target and is part of the overall Carl Zeiss roadmap towards CO2 Neutrality in own operations worldwide by 2025. This overall target was decided upon by the Carl Zeiss board on 23.11.2020. As reported in the introductory chapter, Carl Zeiss discloses all information based on financial years and also sets its targets accordingly."
"Carlsberg commits to achieving zero GHG emissions from its breweries by 2030, from a 2015 base year, which is equivalent to reducing total scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions 92%. This is supported by an interim 2022 target to reduce the GHG emissions from breweries by 50%, which is equivalent to reducing total scope 1 and 2 emissions by 46%.Target coverage: The target covers 92% of the total Scope 1 + 2 emissions, which is equivalent to the emissions associated with the operations of all sites (breweries and other beverage sites). The 8% not included in this target are the downstream (out-bound) logistics operated by Carlsberg.Our target is running over 15 years and if our progress is linear, we should reduce by 6.66% per year. The 33.5% we achieved by 2020, compared to 2015 baseline, is in line with our expectations and plan. Since 2015  we have reduced our absolute emission by 33.5%"

"Having already reduced our absolute GHG emissions by 45% between 2005 and 2010, we know that an additional 40% reduction in absolute emissions is ambitious. Combined with our Net Climate Benefit Factor, we believe that our climate strategy and targets align with a 1.5°C future."
"This target covers 100% of the Casino Group's GHG emissions of  scope 1 and scope 2.This 100% covers all entities belonging to Casino in 2020 (reporting year). The reduction objective defined and validate by SBTi is higher than the minimum required for 2°C trajectory - Each business unit sets reduction objectives which participates to Group targets.In 2020,?? Grupo Éxito committed to a 35% reduction in Scope 1, Scope 2 and goods transport emissions by 2023;?? GPA committed to a 30% reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 2025;?? Monoprix committed to a 50% reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 2030, on the way to carbon neutrality by 2040. The Group has measured the carbon footprint of its operations since 2009:?? the Group's Scope 1 emissions, corresponding to direct emissions from combustion and refrigerants, amounted to 1,240,000 tonnes of CO2 equivalent in 2020;?? its Scope 2 emissions, corresponding to indirect emissions from the consumption of purchased electricity, amounted to 241,000 tonnes of CO2 equivalent in 2020 (location-based method).Allowing for consumption of energy guaranteed as renewable, its Scope 2 emissions totalled 222,000 tonnes of CO2 equivalent in 2020 (market-based method).These results are in line with Casino Group's SBT commitments for Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions."
"An initial measurement of indirect (i.e., Scope 3) emissions arising from the Group's operations was carried out in 2012, with support from a specialist consultancy. Since then, the Group measures all these emissions from internal data and related emission factors.This target covers 100% of scope 3 emissions related to purchased goods and services and 100% of scope 3 emissions related to use of sold products. These two categories represent 67% of the total scope 3. We also work on the others categories. The group registers an  exceptional decrease of 13% and has achieved the reduction target : we assume that this situation is  partly due to the pandemic situation which impacts the activity of the group -this result may change in the comings years, that 's why we consider this target as ""underway""."
"This target has been defined in the framework of Long-Term Incentive (LTI) bonus for 2021-2023 in line with the SBT target validated at group level . The minimum threshold set for the criterion related to reducing CO2 emissions (380 kT) corresponds to the target objective for 2020 (on a same-scope basis). The target value (370 kT) and maximum value have been set bearing in mind the progress made in 2020, although given the fact that many action plans have already been put in place to reduce GHG, much more effort will be needed to raise performance for this indicator after 2022 than before then."
The group has fixed an objective of -38% of carbon emission by 2030 compared to 2015. This target is aligned with the WB Trajectory . This objective has been set up in 2021 that' s why it is not to date validated by SBTi but the group will present it for the next submission

We have a 5-year target of 15% (2019-2023).  We committed to a science-based target in FY21 and are compiling our validation evidence pack to support a 42% reduction in Scope 1 &2 emissions by 2030.
"This year, Cathay still include all of our subsidiaries to set the carbon reduction goal with the reference of capability of GHG reduction, RE use and equipment replace plan.  Aside from that, we refer the methodology of SBT-  absolutely convergence - to set the long term goal to 2030 which reduce at least 2.5% annually with 2020 as a base year."
"When setting the goal, we focus on our 100% operation site, and analyzed statistics from headquarter office building, a major source of emissions, after implementing ISO 50001 in 2016. On this basis, using 2016 as the base year, we have formulated the reasonable goal of reducing scope 2 GHG emission by at least 5% in the 5 years from 2017 to 2021."

CBRE has committed to reducing scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions 68% by 2035 from the 2019 base year. This target covers GHG emissions from the company's global operations and is aligned with the ambition of the Paris Agreement to limit global temperature rise to 1.5°C.
"2019 was adopted as the base year for reporting CCC S.A.'s and CCC Group's emissions. Base year emissions were recalculated in the last reporting cycle, as different emission factors were applied to selected fuels used in company buildings, systems, installations, and vehicles. Moreover, as CCC S.A. changed its financial year, GHG emissions data for the reporting year (thirteen months from January 1st 2020 to January 31st 2021) lacks comparability with base year emissions. In order to achieve comparability, emissions for the thirteen months from January 1st 2019 to January 31st 2020 were calculated to most closely correspond to the base year, and the period was used to compare the reporting year with the base year. Following the recalculation, Scope 1 +2 base year emissions were at 65 030,9 MgCO2e (before recalculation:  92 651,4 MgCO2e)."

"Our absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions reduction target covers 100% of our facilities in which we have operational control. In 2013, Celestica set a target to reduce our GHG emissions 30% by 2020 from a 2012 base year. This meant we had 7 years to reduce our total emissions from 204,884 metric tonnes CO2e to 143,418.80 metric tonnes of CO2e or lower. In 2020, our total emissions were 61,612 metric tonnes of CO2e using a market-based approach. We reduced our emissions by 81,807 metric tonnes of CO2e from our base year in 2012, successfully achieving and surpassing our target by 233%. Our success was a result of renewable energy usage and procurement through utilities, and energy reduction initiatives in our facilites. The global pandemic also played a role in reducing our emissions through work from home measures and reduced production.  In 2020, our Scope 2 emissions decreased by 27% from 2019 levels due to: our use of renewable energy through on-site solar energy, procurement through utilities, and purchases of Energy Attribute Certificates (EACs). In mid-2020, our Portland, Oregon site switched to sourcing 100% wind power for one building through their local utility. This will continue to reduce approximately 840 metric tonnes CO2e annually. Our Thailand site continues to generate renewable energy with its 3.5 megawatts of solar panels. Since the panel installation began in 2016, it has saved an estimated 64,100 metric tonnes of CO2e. Our Galway, Ireland and Valencia, Spain facilities derive 100% of their electricity from renewable energy. Together, these two sites prevented approximately 2,325 metric tonnes of CO2e in 2020. Our Bayside and Warm Springs locations in Fremont, United States continued their partnership with the Community Choice Energy Bright Choice Plan, which enabled them to procure 85% carbon-free power. The combined impact of this program diverted 1,441 metric tonnes of CO2e.Celestica also purchased 155,348 MWh of Energy Attribute Certificates, to cover an additional 54.9% of our GHG emissions. These certificates were purchased from wind and small hydro projects in Thailand, China, Mexico, Norway, Vietnam, and the United States. All certificates are recognized by an external body, such as the International Renewable Energy Certificates (i-REC) StandardRenewable Energy Certificates (REC) Standard, or Guarantees of Origin."
"In 2020, Celestica committed to a new company-wide target to reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions 30% by 2025 from a 2018 base year. This has been approved and is in line with the 1.5C Science-Based Target initiative (SBTi). Our goal is to reduce our total absolute Scope 1 and 2 emissions from 184,024 metric tonnes of CO2e to 128,816.8 metric tonnes of CO2e. In 2020, our total emissions were 61,612 metric tonnes of CO2e using a market-based approach, a reduction of 67,205 metric tonnes of CO2e from our base year in 2018. In 2020, we achieved and surpassed our goal by 222%. We will aim to maintain the 30% reduction of Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 2025 from a 2018 base year."
"In 2020, Celestica committed to a new company-wide target to reduce absolute Scope 3 GHG emissions from fuel and energy-related activities, purchased goods and services, and upstream and downstream transportation and distribution 10% by 2025 from a 2018 base year. This has been approved and is in line with the 1.5C Science-Based Target initiative (SBTi). Our goal is to reduce our total emissions from the Scope 3 categories mentioned above from 306,176 metric tonnes of CO2e to 275,558 metric tonnes of CO2e. In 2020, our total emissions from these categories were 586,978 metric tonnes of CO2e using a market-based approach. Our base year Scope 3 emissions were estimated based on the data we had at the time of setting the target. Since then, we have improved our data collection methods and now have more refined data, hence why our 2020 Scope 3 emissions are higher than our base year emissions. We will continue to obtain more refined data from our supply chain. This target covers 68.7% of our total Scope 3 emissions from the base year which includes the categories that we are most able to control and that make up a significant portion of our emissions inventory. The categories that are not covered by the target are capital goods, waste generated from operations, business travel, employee commuting, processing of sold products, and use of sold products."
"Cellnex Telecom submitted an SBT target on May 2021, which was officially approved by the SBT initiative in June 2021.  This target is company-wide, in line with the 1.5C pathway and aims to reduce absolute Scope 1 & 2 & from fuel and energy related activities GHG emissions by 70% by 2030 from the base year 2020. This target covers 100% of our scope 1 and 2 emissions as well as 100% of category 3.3 emissions. Overall, it covers 70.31% of our total 2020 GHG emissions, and 25.75% of the total scope 3 emissions. In order to fit the reporting of this SBT target to the structure of this reporting table in C4.1a (column ''Scope(s) (or Scope 3 category)”) we have separated our SBT target in 2 targets (Abs 1 and Abs 2), corresponding to the target for scope 1+2 (Abs 1) and for category 3.3 (Abs2).In addition, we wanted to mention that we have carried out a scope 3 screening and we have seen that our scope 3 emissions represent less than 40% of our total carbon footprint, which means that we are not required to include our scope 3 in the SBT target. However, we still have decided voluntarily to include it. Specifically, we have included category 3.3 in this first SBT target submitted corresponding to our Abs1 target, but we have also included category 3.1 and 3.2 in our supplier SBT target that we have also submitted (see target Abs3 for more details).In order to achieve targets Abs1 and Abs2, our Department of Global Energy has launched the Energy Transition Plan based on the following four energy management mechanisms that include some specific actions to develop between 2021 and 2025:i) Principles of Energy 4.0 as intelligent measurement or digitization of processes and procedures related to energy.ii) Purchase of renewable energy (considering the different mechanisms available: energy purchase contracts (PPA), guarantees of origin, etc.).iii) Energy efficiency (offer the same service, but with a reduction in energy consumption).iv) Self-generation of renewable energy, especially by photovoltaic production in the same location to reduce the consumption of electricity from the grid.With all these measures, it is expected to reduce not only the GHG emissions associated with scope 2 (purchase of electricity), but also the reduction of fuels in stationary sources, refrigerant gas leaks and WTT and T&D emissions related to energy."

This target covers 100% of our scope 1 and 2 emissions as well as 100% of category 3.3 emissions. Overall, it covers 70.31% of our total 2020 GHG emissions, and 25.75% of the total scope 3 emissions. In order to fit the reporting of this SBT target to the structure of this reporting table in C4.1a (column ''Scope(s) (or Scope 3 category)”) we have separated our SBT target in 2 targets (Abs 1 and Abs 2), corresponding to the target for scope 1+2 (Abs 1) and for category 3.3 (Abs2).In addition, we wanted to mention that we have carried out a scope 3 screening and we have seen that our scope 3 emissions represent less than 40% of our total carbon footprint, which means that we are not required to include our scope 3 in the SBT target. However, we still have decided voluntarily to include it. Specifically, we have included category 3.3 in this first SBT target submitted corresponding to our Abs2 target, but we have also included category 3.1 and 3.2 in our supplier SBT target that we have also submitted (see target Abs3 for more details).In order to achieve targets Abs1 and Abs2, our Department of Global Energy has launched the Energy Transition Plan based on the following four energy management mechanisms that include some specific actions to develop between 2021 and 2025:i) Principles of Energy 4.0 as intelligent measurement or digitization of processes and procedures related to energy.ii) Purchase of renewable energy (considering the different mechanisms available: energy purchase contracts (PPA), guarantees of origin, etc.).iii) Energy efficiency (offer the same service, but with a reduction in energy consumption).iv) Self-generation of renewable energy, especially by photovoltaic production in the same location to reduce the consumption of electricity from the grid.With all these measures, it is expected to reduce not only the GHG emissions associated with scope 2 (purchase of electricity), but also the reduction of fuels in stationary sources, refrigerant gas leaks and WTT and T&D emissions related to energy."
"Cellnex Telecom submitted an SBT target on May 2021, which was officially approved by the SBT initiative in June 2021. This supplier target is company-wide and in line with the 1.5C pathway. Cellnex Telecom commits to reduce absolute purchased goods and services and capital goods GHG emissions 21% by 2025 from a 2020 base year.The supplier target is established in the suppliers of goods and services and capital goods, covering 100% of the emissions of these 2 categories, with total emissions of 79,764.45 tCO2e. In addition, we wanted to mention that we have carried out a scope 3 screening and we have seen that our scope 3 emissions represent less than 40% of our total carbon footprint, which means that we are not required to include our scope 3 in the SBT target. However, we still have decided voluntarily to include it. Specifically, we have included category 3.3 in one of our SBT targets submitted (corresponding to our Abs2 target), and we have also included category 3.1 and 3.2 in our supplier SBT target here reported (Abs3)."
Eletrobras has established the target reduction of emission of greenhouse gases for Scope 1 (tCO2e) in 1% per year between 2019 and 2023. The reduction achieved in 2020 is due to the increase of renewable energy generation in 12% and the reduction of 21% in fossil fuels consumption.
Eletrobras has established the target reduction of emission of greenhouse gases for Scope 2 (tCO2e) in 1% per year between 2019 and 2023. The  reduction achieved in 2020 was due to the reduction in electric energy consumption of 52% compared to 2019. Part of this reduction is a result of the implementation of energy efficiency and conscious consumption programs and part is related to the reduction of administrative electric energy consumption due to home office.
"The goal is reduce 1% of scope 1 and 2 emission per year between 2021 and 2025. The coverage percentage is 89%, because the transmission losses (non-manageable emissions in the scope 2) are not considered in this target. We do not consider the year 2020 for the purpose of goal achievement due to the effects of the pandemic on emissions."
"Devido a pandemia de Covid 19 a operadora aderiu ao trabalho remoto em todos os postos de trabalho nos quais foram possíveis, além de ter eventos do sistema e de fora cancelados ou substituídos por uma versão digital, o que ocasionou uma redução drástica de emissão de gases do efeito estufa em todos os escopos."
"Centric Beauty division removed or replaced metal, PVC, and/or silicone closures, pumps, or sprayers from PET packaging. The initiative saved 16.4 Metric Tons of CO2e based on Project Gigaton accounting methodology."
"To minimize toxicity in our packaging, Centric BEAUTY will replace 100% of former PVC content for TPE material in primary packaging for National Brand by FY2023."
"To decrease our plastic packaging usage, we will reduce polybag thickness from 1.25 mil to 1.0 mil for all Walmart F&T private label children's apparel (non-sleepwear) polybag packaging by 2022. This will result in ~100 metric tons of CO2e saved."
"To decrease GHG emissions from virgin polyester (PET), AME/BSI division will increase the total volume of recycled PET fiber in their Ladies-Sleepwear collection to 40% by 2022. We estimate this will save 392.13 MT of CO2 emission equivalents."
"To continually improve our impact, we fully reviewed our scope 1 & 2 targets and received Board approval for them in 2020 as part of our People & Planet Plan. We are now focused on an interim target to reduce our emissions 40% by 2034 towards our ambition to be net zero by 2045 (see NZ1). The target encompasses 100% of our global scope 1 and 2 emissions (normalised for divestment and acquisitions, based on operational control), and replaces our outgoing targets (Abs2, Abs3) which remained in place during 2020 whilst we reviewed our strategy. We will be moving to an operational control approach for all our wider reporting from 2021. The target tracks our progress as we transition to a lower carbon company and empowers us to innovate and trial new technologies that aid our ability to provide market-leading services and solutions for customers, while engaging colleagues on understanding and mitigating environmental impact. Reductions in emissions will be delivered via a variety of measures including our continued shift away from carbon-intensive assets towards providing customer-facing services and solutions. We will also continue to drive efficiencies across our operations, with savings arising from energy efficiency and low carbon measures such as solar, distributed generation, battery storage and LED installations alongside wider business efficiencies. Lastly, we will focus on driving down emissions from employee and fleet travel. To demonstrate leadership in this area, we signed up to EV100 to support the EV transition in 2019, ordered 3,000 electric vans with Vauxhall which is the largest commercial EV order of its kind in the UK during 20-21 and bought forward our ambition for our entire UK fleet to be electric by 2025. We have, however, been open and transparent that we do not yet have firm and grounded plans to deliver all of the emission reductions to achieve net zero but we have committed to develop and publish a Climate Transition Plan in 2021.While we consider our target to be science-based, we have continued our dialogue with the SBTi with a view to having it validated. Unfortunately, the delayed publication of the SBTi's oil & gas guidance that they believe will apply to Centrica has slowed the process, but we are exploring options to progress the commitment this year so that we can better meet stakeholder expectations."
"This target encompasses the internal carbon footprint of Centrica's core property, fleet and travel, spanning all brands and subsidiaries globally. It's a sub-target of our global net zero target but given we exceeded it five years earlier than planned, we took the decision to retire the target at the end of the reporting period in 2020 and subsequently replaced it with an upgraded set of science-based targets as part of our People & Plant Plan which was approved in late 2020 (see Abs1 and NZ1). Although the percentage of emissions from our internal carbon footprint is immaterial compared to our total footprint and is therefore not consistent with science-based targets, the management of these impacts are important. The target therefore focuses on areas where colleagues have the greatest ability to influence a decline in emissions which enabled us to drive engagement and benchmark operational performance against businesses with similar impacts, as well as empower us to innovate and trial new technologies that aid our ability to provide market-leading services and solutions. The majority of carbon savings came from reducing our property scope 1 and 2 emissions through energy efficiency measures, solar, distributed generation, battery storage and LED installations alongside business efficiencies. We also targeted a reduction in scope 1 emissions from across our fleet and company cars via take-up of more efficient or hybrid/electric vehicles (EVs)."
"As part of our Responsible Business Ambitions which we upgraded at the end of 2020, we had originally committed to reduce our global carbon emissions in line with Paris and achieve net zero by 2050. This target therefore represented our medium term 2030 milestone which is 15 years on from the 2015 base year. It also encompasses 100% of our global scope 1 and 2 emissions (normalised for divestment and acquisitions) and we consider the target to be science-based, given it meets the CDP 2.1% year-on-year reduction criteria. As part of our continued commitment to follow best practice, we fully reviewed our scope 1 and 2 targets in 2020 and announced an enhanced version as part of our People & Planet Plan. This involved increasing our interim science-based target to 40% reduction by 2034 (see Abs 1) and accelerating our net zero target by five years to 2045 (see NZ1). The target is driving enhanced ambition across our business, including our decision to bring forward our target to electrify our entire UK road fleet to 2025 from 2030."
"As the targets are set on a yearly basis, a new target has been set for 2020. No exclusions were made."
The target has nearly been achived already in 2020. We go on to improve and reduce the emissions. Scope 1 reduction by reducing fuel consumption of company cars and reduction of Gas/Oil for heating purposes. Scope 2 CO2e reduction by efficiency measures and increased part of green electrical energy supply. In 2025 CEWE shall have a scope 1 + 2 combined CO2 footprint of less than 6700 t CO2 although we anticipate a further growth in output and turnover.
"Reduction of Gas/Oil for heating purposes. Installation of heat exchangers when renovation work is progressing. Target is set for longer period to achieve less than 1350 t CO2e. However, due to the three acquisitions in the last two years, this target is momentarily difficult to achieve. We still have activities in place and foreseen in order to achieve the target. Namely, two of our production sites have recently installed and are using district heating since, which has a lower emission factor, but is accounted for in scope 2. We define a new target for heating to be achieved by 2025 (Abs 7)."
"Reduction of fuel consumption of company cars. Currently, usage of natural gas vehicles and diesel vehicles with modern low consumption engines is in place. In the reporting year 2020, the car fleet  was partially substituted by electric and hybrid cars to 13 %.Additionally a project is set in place where the fuel is compensated for (carbon neutral projects). Target is to come below 726 t CO2e.Without respecting the compensation, this CO2e was 1154 t in 2020, and thus little improvement yet. However, the use of the DKV Greencard for fuelling the company cars compensated for 523 t of CO2e. So, this target has been achieved if the compensation could be respected.We define a new target for company cars to be achieved by 2025 (Abs 8)."
"Scope 2 CO2e reduction by efficiency measures and increased part of green electrical energy supply. In 2020, the CO2e scope 2 (market-based) was 4,056 t, which is a reduction of 61 % from 10,384 t in 2015, and which is an achievement towards the target of more than 100 %.We define a new target for the scope 2 emissions to be achieved by 2025 (Abs 9)."
"Reduction of transportation emissions for goods delivered to CEWE's customers. A new project has been started in which more than 50 % of the total delivery, also to the point of sales, shall be made by use of carbon neutral postage offers such as GOGREEN of DHL or CarbonNeutral of UPS. Since beginning of 2017 CEWE has increased the efforts and thereby aims for a more ambitious new target with just 5,500 t CO2e in 2020. In 2018, the main markets in Germany, Austria and Benelux had switched from direct delivery to point of sales to a mail order POS delivery. In 2019 and 2020 additional distribution was switched to Carbon Neutral. However, there was an increase in logisitc activities with additional axes being introduced. This lead to a slight increase of CO2 emission , resulting in 6,850 t CO2e (2020) in total. A new target for this important scope 3 emission will be defined, to be achieved by 2025 (Abs 10)."
"CEWE aims to reduce scope 3 CO2 emissions by many different activities in this scope. Only some shall be shortlisted here. Main activity is the purchased material, and this being mostly paper, CEWE connects with its paper suppliers to have them reduce their carbon footprint significantly. Here, we strive for 15,000 t CO2e reduction until 2025 (minus 28 %). The same way, CEWE aims at a 3,000 t CO2e reduction for capital goods (minus 40 %). CEWE will change its distribution logistics in due course and estimates a reduction of about 8,000 t CO2e (minus 64 %). The other activities within scope 3 will also be addressed, so that at least 27,000 t of CO2e (25 %) of the total scope 3 CO2 emissions shall be reduced until the year 2025.Due to these activities as well as calculation change and waste management improvements for the ""end-of-life treatment of sold products"" category, the overall scope 3 emissions of CEWE amounts to 85258 t CO2e (2020). This would be equal to a reduction of 18.6 % ((85,258 - 104,746)/104,746). This shows, that CEWE is on a good track to achive this goal in time."
"New target for Abs 2. Reduction of Gas/Oil for heating purposes. Installation of heat exchangers when renovation work is progressing. Target is set for longer period to achieve less than 1260 t CO2e. CEWE has activities in place and foreseen in order to achieve the target. The installation and use of district heating with a lower emission factor shall be increased, which is then accounted for in scope 2."
Reduction of fuel consumption of company cars. CEWE anticipates an increased use of electric cars in the near future. ars to 13 %.Additionally a project is set in place where the fuel is compensated for (carbon neutral projects). Target is to come below 800 t CO2e by 2025.
"Scope 2 CO2e reduction by efficiency measures and increased part of green electrical energy supply. In 2020, the CO2e scope 2 (market-based) was 4,056 t, which is a reduction of 61 % from 10,384 t in 2015, and which was an achievement towards the target of more than 100 %.We define here a new target for the scope 2 emissions to be achieved by 2025 (Abs 9), which is extremely ambitious."
"Reduction of transportation emissions for goods delivered to CEWE's customers. A project has been started to replace all CEWE delivery to the point of sale and to the end consumer by use of carbon neutral postage offers such as GOGREEN of DHL or CarbonNeutral of UPS. There is still logisitc activities to be considered where produced material is delivered to distribution points by an axis-like system. Here, the transport company emissions have to be accounted for, and a reduction is very difficult to be achieved. The new target for this important scope 3 emission is set to fall below 5,000 t of CO2e by 2025."

"In 2019, Charles River Laboratories established a baseline year (2018) for Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions for the organization and then set a Science Based Target (SBT) for these Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions which was in line with the Paris Climate Agreement and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. This specific SBT goal is to reduce the Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions from Charles River Laboratories facilities by 50% by 2030 (Science-Based Target), which was submitted in October 2020 and approved by the Science Based Target Initiative in February 2021 (1.5C Ambition).While the base year covered emissions disclosed above do vary slightly from the covered emissions in our initial SBTi application baseline, they are not materially different and reflect the including of a handful of recent acquisitions (less than 4% increase.) Due to the new acquisitions that Charles River Laboratories are making during 2021, the company is planning to re-submit the target to SBTi to validate the new baseline in the beginning of 2022, in alignment with required practices of the SBTi."
"In 2020, Charles River Laboratories established a baseline year (2019) for Scope 3 (upstream & downstream) emissions for the organization and then set a Science Based Target (SBT) for these emissions which was in line with the Paris Climate Agreement and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. This specific SBT goal is to reduce the Scope 3 emissions from Charles River Laboratories value chain by 15% by 2030 (Science-Based Target), which was submitted in October 2020 and approved by the Science Based Target Initiative in February 2021.Please note that Charles River Laboratories recently made an update regarding the methodology and dataset applied to calculate the Scope 3 emissions and due to this change, the base year emissions dropped 34% (representing a more accurate calculation methodology). Due to this decrease, the company is planning to re-submit Scope 3 baseline as part of our update to SBTi to validate the new baseline in the beginning of 2022."
"Schwab has an internal target to achieve 1% in emissions reduction from year to year.  This year, our portfolio size grew 12% but reduced our square-foot carbon output by 8.9%."
"Charoen Pokphand Group has defined the target through the activities of the group with emission controlled to Carbon Neutral Organization within year 2030 (Scope1 and Scope 2). Apart from this, CP group also determine and manage to reduce GHG quantity by 42% following SBTi within year 2030, by using base year 2020, from group's proceeding in which corresponded with Paris Agreement to limit the increasing of world temperature not more than 1.5 C. We will conduct to use the following ways ; 1) To use renewable energy 2) To increase using energy efficiently 3) Circular economy 4)To Plant more forest to absorb CO2 5)To Reduce emission GHG from agriculture 6)To Increase using electric Transportation"
"Through the implementation of the energy saving and emission reduction program in 2020, the company's actual emissions will be 5,531 tons of CO2-equivalent/year, compared to the total emissions of 9,325 tons of CO2-equivalent/year in 2010, a reduction of 3,794 tons of CO2-equivalent/year, a reduction ratio of 40.7%. In addition to the total amount, CCI also focuses on the relative indicator, which is calculated as the monthly average CO2 emissions per $10,000 of revenue, by converting the power consumption and transportation fuel in the plant into CO2-equivalent and then dividing it by the total revenue for the month. From January 2014 to the present, CO2 emissions per $10,000 of revenue have shown a year-on-year decreasing trend."

"Emissions from propellant release during manufacture and testing of our pMDI inhalers account for 65% of our total scope 1&2 emissions. Propellant HFA-134a has a GWP of approximately 1300 therefore GHG emissions linked to the use of this gas are significant. Propellant release during use of pMDI inhalers can't be avoided, being necessary to properly deliver the drug to the patient.To reduce these emissions Chiesi Group has a 5-year, €350 million investment plan to bring new pMDI formulations to market using a new propellant with low GWP (equal to 138), which will reduce the carbon footprint of pMDI inhalers by 90%. Transition to this new formulation requires development and approval from regulatory bodies and Chiesi has developed an ambitious timeline for this transition. Meanwhile, an abatement system has been installed in Parma and Blois manufacturing sites in 2020 and has been operating since the beginning of 2021 in both sites. This system is able to condense the propellant losses in the spray test phase (both in Parma and Blois) and in the filling phase (in Blois only). The propellant recovered is then sent to a high temperature incinerator that safely and effectively destroys it.Moreover, Chiesi has put in place a global project for the electrification of the car fleet that relies on new technologies and involves selected partners. The plan foresees a systematic replacement of our cars with hybrid or electric models, with Italy being the starting point of this electrification plan.Regarding scope 2 emissions, currently 100% of the electricity consumed by Italian sites (accounting for 80% of total energy demand) is renewable (approximately 3% produced on-site by photovoltaic systems) and of high quality, as it comes from low impact sources (in particular wind) and from specific new plants (grid connection less than 5 years). In addition, a Corporate Green Energy Purchasing Guideline has been shared in 2021 with all Group's affiliates. In 2021 Chiesi plans to use electricity from renewable sources in all our manufacturing plants."
"Emissions from propellant release during the use of our pMDI inhalers account for 73% of our total scope 3 emissions. Propellant HFA-134a has a GWP of approximately 1300 therefore GHG emissions linked to the use of this gas are significant. Propellant release during use of pMDI inhalers can't be avoided, being necessary to properly deliver the drug to the patient.To reduce these emissions Chiesi Group has a 5-year, €350 million investment plan to bring new pMDI formulations to market using a new propellant with low GWP (equal to 138), which will reduce the carbon footprint of pMDI inhalers by 90%. Transition to this new formulation requires development and approval from regulatory bodies and Chiesi has developed an ambitious timeline for this transition. At the same time, Chiesi continues to invest in dry powder inhaler (DPI) technology that does not contain propellants and so has a much lower carbon footprint relative to pMDI technology, in order to provide patients with the whole range of therapies they need.Additionally, until pMDIs with new propellant become available, Chiesi is promoting and endorsing virtuous behaviours aimed at optimizing inhalation therapy (to reduce unnecessary emissions) and is investing in disposal/recycling schemes to enable capture of left-over propellant in used inhalers."

"Stated on 2020 CSR Report, page 126~130: We promote GHG-related action plans, setting a medium-term objective of 2% reduction in three years and a medium- to long-term objective of 3% reduction in five years from the 2016 comparison base. Thus, CDF set the 2020 goal as GHG emission down 2.5% vs. 2016. In 2016, CDF kicked off the ISO 14064-1 GHG inventory and verification (Scope 1 and Scope 2). Since 2017, CDF keep expanding the scope of GHG inventory and verification, and in 2020 covered major buildingsand 53 branches of KGI Bank, or 97.8% of employees. To effectively control GHG emissions, we have not only expanded the scope of coverage but also expanded the scale for indirect emissions (Scope 3). In 2020, the total GHG emissions (Scope 1 and Scope 2) were down 952.14 metric tons of CO2e, or 105.3%, from 2016 and down 1,233.82 metric tons of CO2e vs. the goal in 2020 (meeting the medium-term objective of 2.5% reduction), and per-capital emissions were down 0.26 metric tons of CO2e, or 106.5%, from 2016. Since 2019, the company CSR report has included China Life Insurance data from 2016 to 2020, which was acquired by the company with a 25.33% equity in China Life Insurance through tender in September 2017, with consolidated shareholding ratio reaching 34.82% by the end of 2019."
"Stated on 2020 CSR Report, page 126~130:CDF conducts its Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions inventory check annually by adopting the ISO 14064-1 standard. The ISO 50001 energy management system is also in place to improve energy efficiency. The Scope 3 emissions, which mainly come from employees' business travel, copy paper consumption, waste incineration, and physical mailing, are reviewed independently. CDF also sets carbon reduction targets to evaluate it progress on improving global warming.In response to the low-carbon transition, CDF has committed to achieve net zero carbon emissions of its own operations by 2030 with the base period of 2019, including carbon emissions of scope 1, 2 and business travel. Also, CDF has established a low-carbon transition path plan and phased goals for net zero carbon emissions within 18 months, and will continue to monitor and revise the implementation path of achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2030 from 2023 to 2029. In 2019, carbon emissions of Scope 1 and 2 were 22,898.92 metric tons, with a coverage rate of 97.8%. In 2020, carbon emissions of business travel were 22,021.09 metric tons, and its coverage rate was 97.8%. The carbon emissions were reduced by 877.83 metric tons of CO2e in 2020 compared to 2019, which has achieved 3.8% of the net zero carbon emission target in 2030."
"Stated on 2020 CSR Report, page 131~132:CDF began unaudited inventorying and reporting carbon emissions from employees' business travels by public transportation in 2015, including aircraft, Taiwan High Speed Rail (THSR), Taiwan Railways, and taxis. Estimated carbon emissions from business travel are calculated based on the amount of carbon emissions generated by each type of transportation (carbon emissions from aircraft were calculated based on the United Nations International Civil Aviation Organization's Carbon Emissions Calculator with data from the same year provided on its website; those from highspeed rail were calculated based on 2017 carbon footprint data provided on THSR's website; and those from railway and taxi were calculated based on the Industrial Technology Research Institute's carbon footprint calculation platform with 2014 and 2015 data) and the number of miles traveled. In 2015 and 2016, the scope included only employees of CDF and CDIB Capital Group, expanded in 2017 to include those of KGI Bank and KGI Securities, and in 2019 to China Life Insurance. The scope of data in 2020 covered CDF and all of its subsidiaries. The coverage rate was 97.8% based on the number of employees. CDF conducts annual greenhouse gas inventory and independent inspections of Scope 3 employee business travel, photocopying paper, waste incineration and mail delivery, and sets carbon reduction targets to evaluate the progress of financial control in reducing global warming. In response to the low-carbon transition, on Apr. 2021, CDF commits to set a goal of achieving net zero carbon emissions from its own operations by 2030 with the base period of 2019, including Scope 1, 2 and business travel, and will develop implementation roadmap for net zero carbon emissions within 18 months. From 2023 to 2029, CDF will continue to monitor and revise the implementation path to achieve 2030 goal. In 2019, carbon emissions of business travel were 478.1 metric tons, with a coverage rate of 96.3%. In 2020, carbon emissions of business travel were 194.42 metric tons, and its coverage rate was 97.8%. Due to COVID-19 and less business travel, the carbon emission reduced drastically by 283.68 metric tons of CO2e in 2020 compared to 2019, which has achieved 59.3% of the net zero carbon emission target in 2030."
"CDF uses the standardized tools provided by PCAF in November 2020 to conduct the carbon inventory of its investment and financing portfolio, and has completed approximately 72.4% of the inventory in 2021. Excluding the government bonds and power company investment positions, its exposure limit is NTD 1,455, 347 million, and carbon emissions are 3,925,318 metric tons. CDF will further set the carbon reduction target according to the inventory result, and develop strategies and decarbonisation pathway based on exploratory content analysis tools and the future uncertainty, in order to deal with the impact of future carbon reduction transitions. CDF has committed to achieve the net zero carbon emission target of the total portfolio by 2045 (take 2020 as base period), and set two phased goals include a 25% reduction in emissions by 2025 and a 50% reduction in emissions by 2030. To achieve net zero carbon emission, CDF continues to increase green investment and financing, and reduce high-carbon emission portfolio. CDF proposed the goal on April 2021, and established a low-carbon transition path plan and phased goals for net zero carbon emissions within 18 months, and will continue to monitor and revise the implementation path of net zero carbon emissions from 2023 to 2045."
"The company's reduction target is revised from 2% of the annual base year to 2025, which is 20% less than the base year's emissions, so it is an absolute reduction, equivalent to a reduction of 520,059 metric tons of CO2e."
"The company's reduction target is revised from 2% of the annual base year to 2050, which is 50% less than the base year's emissions. Therefore, it is an absolute reduction, which is equivalent to a reduction of 1,300,147.65 metric tons of CO2e."

"In 2020, our absolute carbon reduction goal for legacy Cigna operations expired. We exceeded our 20% greenhouse gas target by 18% from the 2013 baseline. Please note that, due to the majority of our employees working remotely during the year as a result of COVID-19, we consider 2020 consumption data anomalous. As such, we are reporting our progress against our 2013 baseline using the data from the end of 2019.In addition to gains in energy reduction, Cigna benefitted from the electric power grid and natural gas becoming less carbon-intensive per unit of energy consumed.Also, please note that reported progress against Cigna's 2020 target was based on legacy Cigna locations. Cigna's 2019 absolute emissions have increased above 2013 base year levels. This is due to Cigna's combination at the end of 2018 with Express Scripts and affiliates."
"We aim to become carbon neutral for Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2040. In support, Cigna aims to achieve a 50% absolute reduction in Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2030 using as 2019 base year, which is our first year of data that is inclusive of Cigna's combination with Express Scripts and affiliates.

"Reducing GHG emissions has clear business benefits to our suppliers and contributes to Cisco's long-term operational success. To drive progress, we have committed to a goal for suppliers to set public, absolute GHG emissions reduction targets, and a longer-term goal to reduce Cisco's absolute supply chain-related Scope 3 GHG emissions.Abs 3: Reduce Cisco supply chain-related Scope 3 GHG emissions by 30 percent absolute by FY30 (FY19 base year)Includes allocated emissions from Cisco's Tier 1 and Tier 2 manufacturing, component, and warehouse suppliers, and calculated emissions associated with transportation emissions managed and paid for by Cisco. Emissions are allocated based on Cisco's financial share of the supplier's reported global Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions. Transportation emissions will be reported as Upstream Transportation and Distribution according to GHG Protocol methodology because they are paid directly by Cisco.Due to the standard lag between when emissions occur at our suppliers and when they are reported to Cisco through CDP, we are reporting our FY19 baseline in this disclosure. Verified progress against this goal will not be available until our 2021 CSR report (when we have the data to calculate our FY20 results). This progress will be reported in the 2022 CDP disclosure.See section C6.5 to see more details on scope 3 methodology and the forecasted FY20 results for each upstream category included in this target.Please note that WSP verifies Cisco's emissions on an annual basis."

"As part of our Operations goals, we have emission goals for Citi's global footprint. Our 2020 goal was to reduce carbon emissions by 35% and energy consumption by 30%, with an annual carbon reduction rate of 2.33%. As of 2020, we have surpassed this goal and achieved a 51.78% reduction. This was a science-based interim goal proportioned out so that the firm is on track to meet its long term science-based goal in 2050 of an 80% absolute reduction in emissions. Our 2020 goal was a medium term goal of 5 years and our long term goal is 45 years, both with a base year of 2005 and start year of 2006. Since Citi is part of the global initiative RE100 and committed to source 100% renewable starting in 2020, the carbon reduction rate increases significantly. Our 2050 science-based goal was updated in 2021 with our net zero operations by 2030 commitment, which we will report on in future disclosures."
"As part of our Operations goals, we have long term emission goals for Citi's global footprint. Our 2050 science-based goal is based upon our portfolio mix and is created to maintain reductions needed to cap global temperature increase at 2 degrees Celsius, taking into account the latest IPCC assessment. Though our long term science-based goal of an 80% reduction by the year 2050 gave an annual carbon reduction of 1.78%,  as Citi is part of the global initiative RE100 and committed to source 100% renewable electricity starting in 2020, the carbon reduction rate increases significantly, surpassing 2.1%.

More recently, we have sought to update our currently disclosed targets to reflect an even higher level of ambition and is comprehensive of our entire footprint. However, this work was done in 2021 and will be disclosed in additional detail in our next year's CDP response."
"In strong support of the world's urgent transition to a low-carbon economy, Citrix has initiated targets to reduce our total absolute GHG emissions by 30% by 2030 and reduce our emissions per unit of revenue by 50% by 2030. These goals will use our 2019 emissions as a baseline for factors included and cover scopes 1, 2 and 3. We expect to refine these targets over the next 1-2 years to receive approval from the Science Based Target initiative (SBTi) to ensure our targets are consistent with Citrix doing its part to keep global warming well below 2°C.  Please note, we have re-baselined our 2019 emissions to include additional scope 3 categories, and have used 2020 emissions in these categories as a proxy for 2019 figures.  The scope 3 categories previously included were categories 5 and 6. The added scope 3 categories are category 1, 2, 3, 9 and 11."

"Citycon has set a SBT in May of 2021 and this, our internal target, is more ambitious than the SME 1,5C option that we have committed to. Therefore, we have assessed this target to be fully compatible with the SBTi. Our current emission calculations cover scope 1 and 2 in full as well as parts of upstream Scope 3 emissions. We are currently carrying out a full Scope 3 emsssions analysis as well as carbon neutrality roadmap. Both due to be ready by the end of July 2021."
Citycon set a Science Based Target in May 2021. The base-year for the target is the same as the reported year although the target was set in 2021.
"The new factory was put into operation in November 2018, and 350,000 tonnes are expected by 2025. With rapid expansion by 2025, the target of reduction is set first with the existing workplace.Of the 405,879tons of emissions in 2020.Recent changes in government policy and a dramatic increase in internal production have inevitably necessitated a re-setting. We have thus set a new greenhouse gas reduction target in 2030 .Due to Corona 19, a new review of mid- to long-term emissions established in 2019 is underway.According to the Paris Convention, the government has set a target to reduce the government 's GHG emissions target by 2030 to 37% of the BAU in 2030. 37% reduction is 32.5% reduction of domestic emissions and 4.5% reduction of overseas emission rights. We set our targets based on 2030 BAU emissions. The target is to reduce existing business and new business (M & A and new business after 2018) by 38% compared to BAU. Accordingly, in 2030 BAU will have 1,050 thousand tons (430 thousand tons originally, 620 thousand tons newly), and the target is 650 thousand tons (existing 250 thousand tons, new 400 thousand tons). Since 2018, we have increased emissions by more than 50% due to the large-scale expansion of the Hatban and Mandu production lines and the construction of new plants. The plant is planned to be built continuously in three stages by 2025.As we are expanding our global business in earnest, overseas business sites are being established and mergers and acquisitions are continuing. By 2025, the expansion of business sites is expected to proceed significantly, and goal setting will be carried out when the ordination is completed."
"In 2019, Clariant successfully closed the divestment of its Healthcare Packaging business and agreed to sell its entire Masterbatches business to PolyOne, which was concluded in July 2020 to form the new company Avient. As part of the portfolio repositioning announced in 2018, Clariant also continues with the divestment of its Pigments business, which it expects to conclude by the end of 2021. This will allow Clariant to focus on the three core Business Areas that offer differentiated products and services with above-average growth potential. Therefore, the target proposal focuses on the continuing business of Clariant.We have collected the 2019 environmental key figure data from all production sites, except from those smaller sites having a very limited footprint. The sites not included are considered irrelevant in relation to the total emission. The total sum of sites excluded is lower than 0.5% of the group-wide Scope 1 and 2 emissions. The full scope of key figure data collection from all production sites (including the smaller sites) is done every 3 years, of which the latest was done for the 2017 full year. This approach has been externally verified by PwC."

"The International Maritime Organization (IMO), UN's agency in charge of regulating shipping, has set in 2018 an objective for shipping industry to decrease by 50% their absolute emissions towards 2050, baseline 2008. As with this target, the emissions covered are the ones emitted through direct shipping industry operations, which are ships' fuel consumption, and as these represented in 2019 99,6% of our scope 1, this target only concerns this part of our Scope 1. We have yet succeeded to decrease our absolute emissions by 20,06%, thanks to the implementation of ecotechnologies on ships to increase their energy efficiency, to the implementation of slow steaming in 2009 (from 25 knots, our ships' average speed decreased to 18), of route optimization through our Navigation Fleet Center, thanks to further ships' optimization when built and thanks to commercial alliances. In 2020, we are planning to set further initiatives to reach carbon neutrality by 2050, objective that our CEO set on June during a United Nations conference, and then to reach IMO's target at the same time."

"In 2020, we will set a new goal: by 2030, the total carbon footprint will be carbon neutral. We plan to reduce emissions by 75% by 2030 from 2015 levels through product design, energy efficiency and renewable energy. The scientific carbon target consistent with the 1.5 degree C trajectory requires a linear reduction of 4.2% per year. Since this is equivalent to a 47% reduction in our target period, we believe that the target has met the requirements based on climate science."
"The target coverage includes CMS CMNO's Scope 1 and 2 (market-based) emissions, in addition to Scope 3 categories. Our targets proposed lead to absolute reductions in emissions, align with a 1.5 degree warming scenario and cover all relevant sources of scope emissions. CMS CMNO's Scope 3 emissions make up 95% of our emissions footprint and therefore inclusion of relevant Scope 3 categories is important. The relevant Scope 3 categories which are included in the target are: Purchased goods and services, Capital goods, Fuel and Energy related activities, Upstream transportation & distribution, Waste generated in operations, Business travel and Employee commuting."

"Thanks to our World Class Manufacturing program and the ISO 50001 standard we can monitor and improve our performances in term of energy saving projects and CO2 emission reduction. Together with the technical projects we have implemented numerous managerial actions to spread the awareness among people in plants to manage our energy consumption in a more efficient way. In 2020 CNH industrial implemented 287 technical and managerial initiatives involving the redesign of processes, equipment conversion and retrofitting, operational changes to new installations, and increased employee awareness."
"We have developed ""CSV Goals"" which is a non-financial goal, to expand ESG-related initiatives and achieve Creating Shared Value.As one of goals, we set a target to reduce absolute GHG emissions 25% by 2030 from a 2015 base-year. The scope includes manufacture, office, operation, and sales. We strongly declare a commitment to [World Without Waste] which is the new environmental goal announced by The Coca-Cola Company, through achieving ""CSV Goals""."
"We've made strong progress over the last decade, reducing Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions across our entire value chain by 37.7% between 2010-2019. However, much more needs to be done. That is why we updated our climate strategy in December 2020, including an ambition to reach net zero GHG emissions by 2040 and a target to reduce our absolute GHG emissions across our value chain by 30% by 2030 (versus 2019). Within that target, we committed to reduce absolute scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions 47% by 2030 from a 2019 base year and reduce absolute scope 3 GHG emissions 29% by 2030 from a 2019 base year. Our GHG reduction target has been approved by the SBTi as being in line with a 1.5?C reduction pathway, as recommended by the IPCC. Based upon the boundary scope of our absolute target, we have achieved a 11,9% absolute reduction in carbon emissions from a 2019 baseline. This represents 40% completion so far."
"This represents our previous absolute carbon reduction target, which was replaced in December 2020. This previous target, which was approved by the SBTi as aligned to a well-below 2 degree pathway, was to cut absolute GHG emissions from what we defined as our ""core business""  (manufacturing, cold drink equipment, and distribution activities) by 50% by 2025, vs a 2010 baseline. This target measured the absolute reduction in GHG emissions in core business operations since 2010 (%).  The target included 100% of emissions in scope , representing all of CCEP's scope 1+2 emissions (100%) plus additional scope 3 activities where we believed we could have a direct influence in our value chain. In total this target covered 32% of our total value chain (scope 1, 2 and scope 3) emissions in 2019. Based upon the boundary scope of our absolute target, we have achieved a 56.7% absolute reduction in carbon emissions from a 2010 baseline. This represented 113% completion in 2020.We also previously had an emissions intensity/relative target - which aimed to reduce emissions across our value chain by 35% by 2025, versus a 2010 baseline. This was a relative target, aiming to reduce GHG emissions per litre of product sold, measured by CO2e g / litre of product sold. The target included Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions including  ingredients, packaging, manufacturing, distribution and transportation, cooling and recycling of our products.In December 2020, we replaced both these targets with our new, single Abs1 absolute reduction target, aiming to reduce our absolute GHG emissions across our total value chain by 30% by 2030 (versus 2019). Our baseline year has been updated from 2010 to 2019 in line with SBTi guidance. Our baseline carbon figures for 2019 have also been restated to include new emission sources and more accurate data. Our updated absolute reduction target also includes additional Scope 3 sources of emissions that had been excluded in our previous absolute reduction target but included in our intensity reduction target (e.g., packaging and ingredients, and other Scope 3 categories such as business travel). Our GHG reduction target has been approved by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) as being in line with a 1.5?C reduction pathway, as recommended by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change."

"At the end of 2020, our new set of 2030 Science-Based Targets has been approved by SBTi, as our previous SBT period-closing was end of 2020. Our new Scope 1+2 target is to reduce absolute operational emissions by 55% till year 2030 vs. 2017 baseline following the 1.5 degree global warming scenario. So far, we have achieved 26% reduction of our operational emissions vs. 2017."
"At the end of 2020, our new set of 2030 Science-Based Targets has been approved by SBTi, as our previous SBT period-closing was end of 2020. Our new target is to reduce Scope 3 absolute emissions by 21% till year 2030 vs. 2017 baseline. So far, we have achieved 11% reduction of our Scope 3 emissions vs. 2017. Our Scope 3 emissions are 89% of our total value chain emissions. According to SBTi, targets set for Scope 3 are not required to be following the 2 degrees scenario and still our Scope 3 target was approved by SBTi as ""challenging and robust""."
"Convinced that science-based climate action is the most effective way to achieve its objectives, Cofinimmo confirmed its ESG commitment in 2020 by validating the objective of the project 30³ according to the science based targets initiative (SBTi). This absolute target (Abs 1) is part of project 30³ which is an intensity target (see Int 1) and which includes scope 1, 2 and 3."
"Cogeco's science-based emissions reduction target covers company-wide scope 1 and 2 emissions. Our target follows a financial year calendar.  Our fiscal year runs from September 1 to August 31 of the following year. From September 1, 2019 to August 31st, 2020, Cogeco achieved an absolute emissions reduction of 17% vs our 2019 base year, signifying 26% achievement of our 65% emissions reduction target. This reduction is mainly the result of investment in renewable energy (for the first time) through the purchase of renewable energy certificates and a green utility tariff in Virginia, various fleet fuel efficiency initiatives and some impacts on operations as a result of COVID 19."
"Cogeco's science-based emissions reduction target also includes a target to reduce emissions from the use of sold products by 30% by 2030.  This target is company-wide, covering both our Canadian and U.S. operations. The main source of these emissions comes from equipment in customer homes used to access our internet, video and telephony services. From September 1, 2019 to August 31st, 2020, Cogeco achieved an emissions reduction of approximately 2.7% related to use of our products vs our 2019 base year, signifying 9% achievement of our 30% emissions reduction target. This reduction is mainly the result of the switch to more energy-efficient equipment in customer homes as older models of set top boxes are replaced with newer, more energy-efficient models, as well as the launch of our new internet television service (IPTV) in Canada. The IPTV set-top box consumes approximately 40% less energy than non-IPTV set top boxes. Please note that 2019 emissions from the use of sold products were restated to reflect updated information on our set top box inventory and energy consumption."
"Cogeco's science-based emissions reduction target also includes a target to reduce emissions from employee commuting by 30% by 2030.  This target is company-wide, covering both our Canadian and U.S. operations. From September 1, 2019 to August 31st, 2020, Cogeco achieved an emissions reduction of approximately 24% from employee commuting vs our 2019 base year, signifying 80% achievement of our 30% emissions reduction target. The fiscal 2020 reduction reflects the impacts of Cogeco's work from home policy as a result of the global COVID 19 pandemic which began towards the end of the fiscal year (late March to August 31, 2020).  Please note that 2019 emissions from employee commuting were restated to reflect more detailed information obtained through a company-wide survey on employee commuting."
"Through 2020, we achieved a 37% reduction in our Scope 1 (without fugitive emissions) + Scope 2 (Market Based) emissions versus our 2020 goal of 25% reduction.Fugitive emissions are not included in our 2020 goal as they are a small fraction of our Scope 1 + Scope 2 market-based emissions (1.1%) and are not included in the approved Science-Based targets. However, fugitive emissions are measured, third party reviewed and included in our reported emissions.Approximately 95% of our Scope 1 + Scope 2 (Market Based) emissions are included in this target. The emission sources that are not covered by this target include  a number of Colgate owned offices, warehouses and mobile sources (cars and trucks). These sources are included in our new commitment with the Science Based Targets and future reports.Our climate strategy is anchored in setting and achieving science-based goals to reduce greenhouse gases. As part of our 2015 to 2020 Sustainability Strategy, Colgate developed 2020 and 2050 science-based goals to reduce absolute greenhouse gas emissions by 25% and 50%, respectively, compared to 2002. Colgate collaborated with CDP to develop these goals. Early on, CDP reviewed these goals and indicated that the 2020 and 2050 targets exceeded the requirements of the ''Linear Approach” to a science-based goal, which is based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's ''RCP 2.6 Carbon Pathway,” one of the climate trajectories used for modeling and research. Our 2020 target also exceeds the requirements of the ''Sectoral Decarbonization Approach” to a science-based goal, which is based on the 2°C change in global average temperature scenario developed by the International Energy Agency (IEA). This target was officially approved by SBTi in 2017.Now, Colgate is joining the Science Based Targets initiative, UN Global Compact and the We Mean Business Coalition's Business Ambition for 1.5°C campaign and has received approval for a new SBTs including Scope 1, 2 and 3 targets for 2025 and 2030, using 2018 as baseline that are aligned with limiting global temperature rise to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.This is the last year of CP reporting against the SBT above. A new set of 1.5°C aligned SBTs were approved in 2020 and are also reported in this response."

"In 2017, the SBTi approved Colgate's science based target which included a Scope 3 aspect related to consumer use of our products: ''Colgate-Palmolive Company commits to reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions from manufacturing by 25% from 2002 to 2020, with a longer term goal of a 50% reduction by 2050. Colgate also commits, as a way to reduce our most significant Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions, to promote water conservation awareness to 100% of our global consumers and reduce emissions associated with consumer behaviour by up to 5% from 2016 to 2022, and increase the recycled content of our packaging to 50% by 2020.”We achieved a median value of 5% reduction in emissions associated with consumer behaviour, relative to a 2016 baseline and based on consumer survey results from 2020. Reduction estimates range from 3-8% due to inherent variability in consumer behaviours."

"En línea con el acuerdo de París, y uniéndonos a la Contribución Nacional de Colombia, desde Colombina hemos decidido presentar nuestro objetivo basado en la ciencia para el año 2030, de reducir en un 13% las emisiones de Alcance 1 y 2. Las emisiones absolutas (Alcance 1 + Alcance 2) en el año 2015, que es el año base de medición de nuestro objetivo, fueron de 67172 tCO2e, valor que cubrió el 98% de la producción de Colombina, en el 2019 se tuvo en cuenta la planta de España, lo que indica el cubrimiento del 100% de la operación.La gestión de cambio climático y las iniciativas desarrolladas durante estos 3 años (como reducción del consumo de energía térmica, ahorro y mejor gestión en el uso de recursos como el gas natural, entre otros) nos ha permitido lograr una reducción del 21% de las emisiones absolutas (Alcance 1 + Alcance 2). Esto quiere decir que, en el 2020, el 100% nuestras operaciones productivas generaron un total de 52909 tCO2e."
"Target was set by the end of 2017 and included purchasing of Renewable Energy Certificates for 100% of our electricity consumption , which has been achieved in 2019. This accounts for a CO2 reduction of 33.800 tonnes, compared to the total location-based Scope 2 emissions. Such a reduction in electricity-associated emissions is beyond the 1.5C ambition in accordance to the consensus on the current climate science."
"Despite growing across all geographies, Coloplast wants to reduce emissions from company air travels by 10% compared to 18/19-levels. Due to Covid-19, the use of air travel has been reduced by 45% and well beyond the 10% target. However, once the situation normalises, Coloplast remains committed to limit air travel to 10% less than 18/19 levels and then freeze. Considering the projected growth of the company, such a reduction in emissions from 2019 levels would lead to intensity-based reduction considered ambitious according to the current SBTi criteria (see SBTi Criteria and Recommendations, V4.2 for details)."
"Coloplast operates a car fleet consisting of around 1,900 cars, which based on fuel consumption annually emits 10,200 tonnes of GHG. To reduce its impact, Coloplast will shift to electric company cars with a target of 100% by 2030. This will result in absolute reduction of emissions of 10,200 tonnes CO2 by 2030, aligned with 1.5C ambition level."
"We have made the commitment to be carbon neutral by 2035 for Scope 1 and 2 emissions across our entire global operations. To meet our goals, we are focused on: 1) Sourcing renewable and clean energy - We will shift to more zero carbon, renewable electricity by partnering with local utilities and investing in new renewable energy through power purchase agreements and securing renewable energy credits. 2) Improving our energy efficiency - Across our buildings, network, vehicle fleets, production studios, and theme parks, we will continue to develop and implement projects to improve energy efficiency. Combined with purchasing carbon offsets to address emissions that have not yet been mitigated, these efforts will help us further reduce our carbon footprint. 3) Measuring and reporting on our Scope 1 and 2 emissions annually - To provide transparency and help drive improvement, we have reported data for 2019 and 2020 using the GHG Protocol in alignment with the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) framework. We have partnered with a leading consulting firm to guide us through this and help develop our reporting and estimation approach to make sure we get it right. We realize this public commitment is the first step and we will continue to share our approach and progress as we work towards our goals."
"SkyZero is a 2030 Zero Carbon goal that applies only to the Sky business unit.  This target covers Sky's Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions and is in line with a 1.5 degree C trajectory. This target has been approved by the Science-based Targets Initiative in May 2021. Note: Comcast at an enterprise-level has not yet calculated its Scope 3 inventory. Scope 3 inventory has been calculated only for our Sky business. Hence the calculations in the ""Covered emissions in base year"" exclude Sky's scope 3 emissions. Similarly, the ""covered emissions in reporting year"" excludes Sky's Scope 3 numbers."
Aim was to achieve 100% emission neutral energy for offices as well as datacenters operated by comdivision or our suppliers.
"Having achieved our first GHG emissions reduction target a year ahead of schedule in 2013, Comerica set a new absolute target in 2014. The second-generation GHG emissions reduction target combined the ‘Legacy Comerica' and ‘Legacy Sterling' portfolios and set a new combined portfolio emissions base year of 2012 (the earliest year where the ‘Legacy Sterling' data is available). The 2020 GHG emissions reduction target is: ''Comerica will reduce the total Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions associated with its occupied real estate by 20% below the 2012 base year emissions total of 80,533 by 2020, removing 16,107 MtCO2e from its carbon footprint”. Comerica achieved this more aggressive GHG emissions reduction target three years early (in 2016) through a combination of mitigation activities, rationalization, and consolidation of real estate, and engagement with building occupants on energy efficiency best practices. While we have not had our goal verified as science-based, we believe this goal is generally consistent with a science-based target, and our achievement of an average reduction of 6.6% annually during the goal period likely significantly exceeds the reductions need to achieve a 2 degree C trajectory. As of December 31, 2020, we have achieved 264% percent of the 2020 goal. The target did not include Scope 1 emissions from Comerica-owned vehicles, which accounted for only 1.5% of Comerica's total Scope 1 and 2 base-year GHG emissions (and 1.0% of Comerica's total Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions in 2020). However, we purchased carbon credits to offset our Scope 1 travel emissions in 2020."
"We achieved our second-generation 2020 GHG emissions reduction target in 2016. Comerica set three additional GHG emissions reduction targets in 2018 as part of our third-generation goals (short-, medium-, and long-term targets). The base year remains at 2012 since our organizational structure has remained relatively unchanged. The current short-term GHG emissions reduction target is: ''Comerica will reduce the total Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions associated with its occupied real estate by 50% below the 2012 base year emissions total of 80,533 by 2025, removing 40,267 MtCO2e from its carbon footprint”. We plan to achieve this goal through a combination of mitigation activities, rationalization and consolidation of real estate, and greening of the grid. While we have not had our goal verified as science-based, we believe this goal is generally consistent with a science-based target, with an average estimated reduction of 4.2% annually during the goal period likely exceeds the reductions need to achieve a 2 degree C  trajectory. As of December 31, 2020, we have achieved 106% percent of the 2025 goal. The target does not include Scope 1 emissions from Comerica-owned vehicles, which accounted for only 1.5% of Comerica's total Scope 1 and 2 base-year GHG emissions (and 1.0% of Comerica's total Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions in 2020).

"In 2019, we took an initiative of setting a new SBT that aligns with well-below 2C scenario. This is a medium term target covering 100% of our scope 1 and 2 operations. We have already achieved and exceeded that goal by reducing the amount of business travel conducted using CIB's vehicles, and an AC Enhancement Initiative of the complete renovation of the HVAC system took place in two of our highest traffic branches using the VRV system, which in addition to its enhanced cooling capacity, involves operational and energy efficiency.  We also have applied more stringent measures to monitor refrigerant leakage and put in place a tight maintenance schedule to address any leakages as soon as they occur."
"Taking a leadership stance, we are aiming to eliminate all Scope 1&2 emissions by 2028"
"The latest emissions reduction target for all branches and locations of Commerzbank AG in Germany, formulated in 2012, aims at a reduction of the greenhouse gas emissions of 70 % until 2020 compared to 2007. The reduction target is based on our total emissions of Scope 1, Scope 2 (market based) and Scope 3 according to the VfU standard.In the base year, 100% of all data recorded at this point in time were taken into account. As we are constantly expanding the data collection for our Scope 3 emissions, the share of emissions across all Scopes has fallen from originally 100% to 66.15% in 2019, as we did not collect any data on a) employee commuters in the base year 2007. These are now responsible for 30.34% of our total domestic CO2e emissions. And on b) upstream transportation for our document logistic and internal relocations which is responsible for 3.51% of our total CO2 emissions in 2019. The 100% data collected in the base year today only represent 66.15% of the domestic and 58,80% of the worldwide carbon footprint.Our subsidiaries (such as Bank) are generally not covered by the emission reduction target mentioned above. Only the emissions caused by subsidiaries that are located within the same facilities as Commerzbank AG Germany are included.We succeeded in reducing our greenhouse gas emissions by 70.07 % by the end of 2018 (compared to 2007) and therefore achieved our absolute emissions target early. The total reduction was increased further to 78.3% in 2020, the final target year. The goal was thus clearly exceeded.Commerzbank is aware of the fact, that ""financed emissions"" are relevant according to GHG protocol. Nevertheless, Commerzbank's financed emissions are not part of the emission reduction target, as this was no requirement in the year the emission reduction target was formulated. Please see C-FS14.1 for details on our portfolio analysis."
"The CO2 emissions of the carbon footprint of Commerzbank AG (domestic and international) are to be reduced by 30% by 2025 compared to the base year 2018 and at the same time ensure compliance bank's net zero strategy adopted in 2021.Commerzbank is part of the Net-Zero Banking Alliance of UNEP FI. Commerzbank is one of the first institutes in the world to commit itself to reducing its CO2 emissions as much as possible. The aim is to reduce the carbon footprint of the entire credit and investment portfolio of the bank to zero by 2050 at the latest. For its own banking operations, the bank aims to reduce carbon emissions to net zero by 2040. The 30% reduction presented here is the short-term goal on this path.

"CBA has set a target of reducing its GHG emissions by 16% by 2025 from a 2017 baseline. This target was set based on gross emissions from our Mining facilities and Aluminum Plant operations (scope 1 and 2), although internally indicators are monitored for each product produced at each process stage. In 2020, these emissions decreased by 17,6% compared with 2017, which includes emissions reductions in the Casting stage. The primary factor in these reductions was the implementation of the biomass boiler that started in March 2020. CBA expects further GHG emissions reductions will be achieved in the coming years through our pipeline of energy efficiency, modernization and fuel conversion projects. Although our target have not used the Science Based Targets methodology, because we used those indications in the individual targets for the year 2020, linked to the monetary reward of eligible employees (leaders at all levels). Additionally, in 2020 we will begin the process of structuring targets with the SBTi methodology. We will have two targets, which will replace the absolute reduction target presented in this report. Once our proposed targets are approved by SBTi, we will have a target dedicated to Scope 1 and 2 emission reductions, and a target for Scope 3, which is necessary because indirect emissions represent more than 40% of our total GHG emissions. Both targets will cover emissions from all of CBA's aluminum business."
"Cemig defined two tCO2 emission targets in 2018. One is the absolute target based on a combination of scopes 1 and 2 emissions.As a reference, target year 2022 and base year 2017 were set for total emissions. For scope 1 emissions, we have adopted the following criterion: maintain the SF6 emission percentage at most at 0.66%,and reduce by 10% the mobile source emissions in relation to the 2017 figure. Regarding scope 2 emissions, the following criterion was set: to maintain electric energy consumption at 41,334 MWh (2017 amount) and to have 12.56% in total losses in 2020, 11.53% in 2021 and 11.24% in 2022.Scope 1 emissions in 2020 were: 7,928 tCO2e from the fleet of vehicles, boats and aircrafts; 3,262 tCO2e from fugitive SF6 gas emissions from electrical equipment and fugitive emissions from natural gas distribution and CO2 consumption in fire extinguishers; 198 tCO2e from stationary combustion (diesel in generators and natural gas from stationary sources); 31 tCO2e from agricultural emissions and land use change, totalling 11,419 tCO2e.Cemig's scope 2 emissions in 2020 reached a total of 448,083 tCO2e. Of the total Scope 2 emissions in 2020, 2,386 tCO2e resulted from energy consumption and 445,697 tCO2e (99.5%), resulted from electrical losses in the Transmission and Distribution systems. Also, in 2020, total losses in distribution indicator (IPTD) were of 12.56% against the total energy injected into the distribution system, the figure adopted by Cemig in that year. By combining Scope 1 and 2 emissions, 2020 showed a total of 459,502.8 tCO2e emissions, a 29% reduction against 2019."

"Our target, set in 2019, is to reduce our Scope 1 and Scope 2 company-wide emissions by 30% by 2024, using 2018 as a base year. This target does not exclude any emissions from any geographies or activities. By the reporting year (2020) we have already surpassed this target and hope to continue on the downwards trend with our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions at Group level. To date, our efforts to achieve this target include solar panel installations, green energy contract purchases and reductions in travel. We aim to have Science Based emissions targets set and approved within the coming months, having committed to the SBTi in March 2021."
"The Manchester data centre is a member of the Climate Change Agreement and has to reduce it's electrical consumption to comply with guidelines. We set a 5-year target in 2018 to reduce electrical consumption, and therefore emissions, from our Manchester data centre, by 30%, using 2017 as a base year. To date, we have exceeded this target and expect further reductions in the coming years."
In 2020 we established this science-based target using FY20 (June 2019-May 2020) as a base year covering absolute scope 1 and 2 emissions from company operations. This target was approved by SBTi in early 2021.
"2020 was Conduent's first year calculating Scope 2 emissions (based on 2019 data). Due to constraint of resources related to COVID, we were only able to baseline US Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, with Scope 3 limited to business travel.Our emissions target of 10% was based on planned site closures and a reduction in energy requirements based upon investments in energy efficient LED lighting and energy efficient HVAC systems."

Since June 2020 we are part of the RE100 initiative to show our commitment  to reduce CO2 emissions from production. In November 2020 our environmental targets (climate targets) have been assessed and approved (1.5°C) by the Science Based Targets initiative.
Since June 2020 we are part of the RE100 initiative to show our commitment  to reduce CO2 emissions from our own operations. This target is equal to our committed target in RE100. In November 2020 our environmental targets (climate targets) have been assessed and approved (1.5°C) by the Science Based Targets initiative.
Our target pathway for Scope 3 emissions is:- Reduction of 30% by 2030 (target approved by the SBTi)- Reduction of 75% by 2040- Reduction of 100% latest by 2050
Target covers total Scope 2 emissions. Planned solar installations (over 300kVA) will reduce grid emissions and will allow us to reduce market-based Scope 2 emissions of around 433.64 tCO2e leading to a reduction of Scope 2 emissions of  85 percent until the year 2023.
Target covers total Scope 1 emissions: Reducing Fossil Fuels and switching to renewable fuels.
Target covers Scope 3 emissions from purchased goods and services
"We have established and published an absolute emissions reduction target (market basis) in our 2018 Group CR Report, with a baseline of 2018 emissions (Scope 1 and 2).  The baseline does not include Scope 1 emissions from company fleet and refrigerant gas emissions. Successful achievement of the company wide target in 2020 has highlighted the success of the emissions reduction programme and the requirement of an SBT.  (A re-baseline was completed in 2020 for 2018 base data, to include an additional 602 tCO2e previously unreported due to an error identified in the historical electricity consumption data at two non-manufacturing sites.)"
This covered the CO2 emmissions year on year with the Carbon Trust used for the calculations. It must be noted that the company numbers grew by 15% year on year.
"Part of Coops climate strategy is to become Climate positive in 2030 on scope 1 & 2. 91% of the emission is forecasted to be from reduction initiatives and a transition in the region reported on. The last 9% will be covered by establishing forest in Denmark in our own company (Coop Folkeskov). However, the current version of GHG-Protocol and SBTi does not acknowledge carbon storage and removal projects and consequently our goal is to reduce with 91% in Scope 1 and 2 by 2030. The World Resources Institute (WRI) and World Business Council for Sustainability Development (WBCSD) are to extend the Greenhouse Gas Protocol and provide an accounting and reporting standard for carbon removals, land use and bioenergy by 2022, it is expected that SBTi adopt these guidelines."
"As part of the climate strategy Coop set the ambition of reducing our Scope 3 emission with 1,000,000 tons CO2 by 2030. Due to Coops sale of fossil fuel,we approach the reduction in alignment with SBTi. This means the 1,000,000 tons reduction target was split into two reduction targets: 1) fossil fuel (ABS2) and 2) on the rest of Scope 3 (INT1). ABS2 covers Coops Scope 3 reduction target on our fossil fuel sale. This covers the emission in Use of Sold Products, hence the usage of the fossil fuel sold by Coop. ABS2 aligns with well below 2-degree scenario and are in alignment with the SBTi criteria. This is set with a 2019 baseline, however in 2020 - due to COVID 19- Coops sale of fossil fuel, counter intuitively increased. This is because most of Coops petrol station is placed in smaller communities and since most of our customers travel the last year has been focused on trips in the near community, it has had a positive effect on our sales. However, there has been a small decrease in the emission due to introduction of E10 standards on petrol."
"The baseline identified that the agricultural phase of tobacco production accounts for approximately 40% of total GHG emissions, half of which are attributable to the fuels used to cure tobacco. Since sustainable tobacco production is a key objective for our company, we have strategic goals and plans developed to reduce GHG emissions and address the risk of deforestation related to tobacco cure. To support this commitment, the cooperative has implemented a strategy and tools dedicated to the effective promotion and management of sustainable fuels, which consists of a strategy with all parties involved to promote the use of firewood from sustainable forest management plans (PMFS ) developed in our province, it is evaluated by the environmental secretaries of the provincial government.The use of firewood encompasses 58 tobacco producers who cure in a particular way in their stoves with firewood, and 92 producers who cure in community centers with firewood. The use of firewood from PMFS has zero emissions.Actions were also developed to reduce gas consumption in the stoves of the community stove centers, through the maintenance and measurement of their chimneys, they are calibrated and measured to increase their energy efficiency.The Covid 19 pandemic also influenced changes in habits and procedures, which resulted in energy savings."
"Bus Átha Cliath Gross Emissions reduction target (Scope 1 & 2)-As a public sector, state sponsored body, CIÉ's operating companies have climate targets stemming from Ireland's national emissions targets, which are subject to EU regulation as a member state. Previously Ireland's public sector 2020 targets (as a result of the EU Effort Sharing Decision) included:  A 20% reduction of non-ETS sector emissions on 2005 levels.Bus Átha Cliath have achieved a reduction of 42.4% in total Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions since a base year of 2008. These reductions have been achieved through:- The delivery of a fleet replacement programme, in partnership with the NTA, leading to over 50% of the fleet being upgraded to meet the Euro VI engine emission standard; the highest standard possible in terms of emissions. Euro VI technologies reduce the level of harmful exhaust emissions using diesel particulate filters (DPF) and exhaust gas recirculation (EGR).- The selective catalyst reduction (SCR) system Ad-Blue has also been added to further reduce emissions.- Effective route optimisation has been implemented for operational efficiency.- Implementation of eco-driving training, which has yielded a 13% reduction in fuel use since 2008, equating to 4.2 million litres of diesel.- The introduction of a fuel management system to capture buses using excessive fuel.- The introduction of plug in hybrids due to total 74 in number by 2020/2021. These are expected to reduce bus related greenhouse gas emissions by up to 30%."
"Iarnród Éireann Gross Emissions reduction target (Scope 1 & 2)-As a public sector, state sponsored body CIÉ's operating companies have climate targets stemming from Ireland's national emissions targets, which are subject to EU regulation as a member state. Previously Ireland's public sector 2020 targets (as a result of the EU Effort Sharing Decision) included:  A 20% reduction of non-ETS sector emissions on 2005 levels.Despite the Covid-19 pandemic having a seismic impact on energy performance in 2020, Iarnród Éireann achieved a reduction in CO2 emissions of 38.56% since a baseline of 2006, and achieved a 39.2% improvement in energy efficiency per passenger rail km.These reductions have been achieved with the implementation of a range of operational efficiencies; timetable optimisation; driver training; telematics and projects as follows:- The use of auto-shutdown on a major portion of the diesel multiple unit (DMU) fleet.- Renewal of infrastructure which has permitted timetable optimisation and eliminated temporary speed restrictions.- Implementation of modified fleet strategy to match train size to customer demand.- Telematics for older rolling stock providing online data of distance travelled and fuel consumption.- Use of Envirox fuel additive to reduce fuel consumption and delivering energy efficiency (and reduced emissions), with savings of approximately 3%. Nationwide use of Envirox commenced in 2019."
"Bus Éireann energy efficiency metric has now improved by 20.6% (SEAI verified) in 2020 from the baseline year 2009. ISO50001 energy management certification through the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI) was achieved during the year by the cross-functional Energy Team. This was the first certification in the company and provides a basis for continued necessary progress, given the target to achieve 50% energy efficiency improvement by 2030. A fleet telematics system was introduced across the service fleet during the year, promoting fuel efficient driving behaviours.Thirty new vehicles were added to the fleet in 2020, with the NTA policy to cease purchasing diesel-only urban vehicles, the first tranche of 26 hybrid double deck buses were delivered at the end of 2020. A further 35 plug-in hybrid double deck buses is expected to arrive at the end of 2021. These are expected to reduce bus related greenhouse gas emissions by up to 30%. This is the first step in the transformation of the bus fleet from diesel engines to electric and fuel cell electric power. The plug-in hybrid vehicles being added to the fleet are a stepping stone towards a fully electric fleet. This will also require the transformation of depot facilities to ensure effective charging and maintenance of the new fleet.The NTA have ordered 40 single-deck battery electric buses to be delivered early in 2022, with at least 11 going to Bus Éireann to go into service in Athlone town. Following this approximately 35-40 full battery electric buses are expected to be delivered each year, which will allow Bus Éireann to reach 30% zero emission vehicles by 2025.At the end of 2020, 55% of the Bus Éireann service fleet are now at the cleaner Euro VI engine emissions standard. This figure will improve further with the planned arrival of additional Expressway and local service fleet in the coming year.A significant milestone was achieved in 2020 with the operation of the first hydrogen fuelled bus in service in Ireland as part of a trial involving Bus Éireann, Bus Átha Cliath, Hydrogen Mobility Ireland, CIÉ and DCU. A more extensive NTA-funded three bus (double deck) trial will commence in Q3 of 2021. Detailed preparatory work has been carried out to ensure the learnings from the trial will inform future fleet purchase decisions."
"Our original 2015 science based target was expected to increase from 5642 tCO2e to 7598 tCO2e in 2020.   Since that time, we have expanded our collection of data to dive deeper into our data to eliminate some modelling.Starting in 2019 we are reporting targets with base year of 2018 for 5 and 7 years ending in 2023 and 2025 for 22 Mid-level ATC's instead of 6 ATC and reporting emission data obtained since 2017 for these locations.  This information has been updated in this year CDP disclosures.   To achieve the recommended reduction levels, Core Labs would need to set a target requiring a 45% reduction by 2030 from 2010 levels to stay under 1.5°C and reach net zero by 2050, using the IPCC special report published in October 2018. In comparison to 2018 emissions, Core Laboratories latest baseline year assessment, this equates to 12.5% reduction by 2023 for a ‘well below 2 degree' scenario (WB2C) and 21% for a 1.5 degree scenario (1.5C). Emissions for the 21 sites would need to decrease from 50,748 tCO2e to 44,405 tCO2e by 2023 under the WB2C scenarios and or to 40,091 tCO2e under the 1.5C scenario.  By 2025, reductions of 19% and 27% are required under the WB2C and 1.5C scenarios respectively from the baseline year of 2018.The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly reduced demand for our services, and has had, and is likely to continue to have, a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have resulted in a significant and swift reduction in international and U.S. economic activity.  The extent to which our operating and financial results will continue to be affected by COVID-19 will depend on various factors and consequences beyond our control, which will depend on numerous evolving factors and future developments that it is not able to predict.Any of those outcomes could have a material adverse effect on Core Lab's business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and could perhaps amplify risk factors.  For these reasons while Core Lab has achieved our 2025 target at Well-below 2°C aligned 5 years ahead of the planned date we do not consider the goal achieved but rather still underway with no plans to set a new base year and goal.The information on targets and Trucost report files.  https://www.corelab.com/cr/environmental-focus"

Since that time, we have expanded our collection of data to dive deeper into our data to eliminate some modelling.Starting in 2019 we are reporting targets with base year of 2018 for  5 and 7 years ending in 2023 and 2025 for 22 Mid-level ATC's instead of 6 ATC and reporting emission data obtained since 2017 for these locations.  This information has been updated in this year CDP disclosures.   To achieve the recommended reduction levels, Core Labs would need to set a target requiring a 45% reduction by 2030 from 2010 levels to stay under 1.5°C and reach net zero by 2050, using the IPCC special report published in October 2018. In comparison to 2018 emissions, Core Laboratories latest baseline year assessment, this equates to 12.5% reduction by 2023 for a ‘well below 2 degree' scenario (WB2C) and 21% for a 1.5 degree scenario (1.5C). Emissions for the 21 sites would need to decrease from 50,748 tCO2e to 44,405 tCO2e by 2023 under the WB2C scenarios and or to 40,091 tCO2e under the 1.5C scenario.  By 2025, reductions of 19% and 27% are required under the WB2C and 1.5C scenarios respectively from the baseline year of 2018.The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly reduced demand for our services, and has had, and is likely to continue to have, a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have resulted in a significant and swift reduction in international and U.S. economic activity.  The extent to which our operating and financial results will continue to be affected by COVID-19 will depend on various factors and consequences beyond our control, which will depend on numerous evolving factors and future developments that it is not able to predict.Any of those outcomes could have a material adverse effect on Core Lab's business, financial condition, results of operations  and cash flows and could perhaps amplify risk factors.  For these reasons while Core Lab has achieved our 2025 target at Well-below 2°C aligned 5 years ahead of the planned date we do not consider the goal achieved but rather still underway with not plans to set a new base year and goal.The information on targets and Trucost report files.  https://www.corelab.com/cr/environmental-focus"

"By a optimized planning, reduce CO2 emissions from transportation of personnel and products."
"Scope 1 in Vesta is primarily due to use diesel in our firefighting systems; in 2020 this use was limited to testing to ensure proper functioning. Our target is to achieve a 20% reduction in energy consumption in our common areas and offices by the year 2024, using 2019 as the base year."
"The energy we consume for operating our common areas and our offices in industrial parks and corporate offices comes mainly from the Federal Electricity Commission (CFE) supply; a smaller percentage comes from solar panels installed at three of our parks.Our target is to achieve a 20% reduction in energy consumption in our common areas and offices by the year 2024, using 2019 as the base year."
Promote a continuous reductions in the carbon footprint of our tenant base:+Increase transparency via contractual commitments to share environmental impact+Foster and monitor continuous improvement+Reduce the carbon and hydric intensity of our leased areas (scope 3) by 10%
"In 2020 Correos reduced its emissions in scopes 1, 2 and 3 with respect to the base year by 24%.  This signifies 100% of the fulfillment of the target for 2020.This reduction in emissions is determined by a series of initiatives adopted in the ''General Sustainability Plan 2014-2020 of Correos”, such as:-The energy efficiency plan, which, applied mainly to buildings, has achieved consumption reductions that far exceed the decrease in volumes. -The purchase of energy with a Certificate of Guarantee of Origin. In 2020, 98% of the electricity consumed was renewable with a certificate of origin. It is worth noting that Correos purchases electricity 100% from renewable sources. The 2% that is not renewable is associated with the consumption of the buildings for which invoices are not available for control. Choosing a conservative value, the use of the electricity mix is assumed in these cases.-The increase in the alternative technology fleet. Since 2015, the gradual incorporation of vehicles with alternative technologies has been maintained. The company's electric fleet, the largest in the sector, doubled in 2020 with the addition of 600 motorcycles and 215 electric vans and cars.In total, the company's fleet of vehicles with alternative technologies vehicles is made up of 1,279 means of transport (electric, hybrid and natural gas), most of which are used for home deliveries in urban environments and historic centers, where the circulation of traditional combustion vehicles is increasingly restricted by municipal mobility regulations. -Fleet renewal with efficiency criteria. -The implementation of the remote work modality at the company's main administrative headquarters, also due to the pandemic, had an impact on the reduction of emissions associated with employee travel.Given that the short-term objectives have reached their period of application and have been successfully completed, in 2020 Correos began work on its new sustainability plan, which will take into account the new environmental commitments assumed for the medium and long term, as well as the changes experienced in the context in which the company operates in recent years."
"In 2020 Correos reduced its emissions in scopes 1, 2 with respect to the base year by 71%. This signifies more than 100% of the fulfillment of the target for 2020.These reductions are mainly due to the same reasons set out in the target (Abs1).In addition, it is worth mentioning the great work being carried out by Correos to raise awareness among its employees. Among the employee awareness initiatives, the following tools should be highlighted: - The annual ""Environmental Commitment Award"", to identify best practices in energy efficiency in the company's buildings.-The dissemination of the consumption reports of the company's main work centers, through the corporate intranet, for individualized monitoring of the progress achieved.-The dissemination of recommendations through internal communication channels.- Participation in ""Earth Hour"", the largest global event in defense of the environment promoted by WWF, which in 2020 had the slogan #FightForYourNature. The company participated with the symbolic switching off of lights in offices, delivery units and work centers, as well as with the internal and external dissemination of the initiative, through the website, corporate profiles on social networks and the incorporation of posters on more than 8,200 delivery carts throughout Spain. Given that the short-term objectives have reached their period of application and have been successfully completed, in 2020 Correos began work on its new sustainability plan, which will take into account the new environmental commitments assumed for the medium and long term, as well as the changes experienced in the context in which the company operates in recent years."
"In the framework of the Climate Change Conference 2019 (COP 25), held in Madrid, Correos announced its new environmental commitments for 2030, which include reaching carbon neutrality and being zero waste before that year.Among the priority lines of action, this objective stands out: -To achieve total neutrality in CO2 emissions by 2030.-To this end, Correos has carried out a Cost-Effectiveness analysis (euros/tCO2e) of the different initiatives that Correos can carry out to achieve this objective. The initiatives are framed in three main areas: Buildings (reduction of electrical, stationary fuel consumption and coolant consumption), Transport (Decarbonization of the fleet through the inculcation of alternative vehicles) and Transversal (all types of initiatives that imply a reduction or compensation of emissions)"
"This target is associated to the project opened by the company  at Group level to purchase 100% electric energy from renewable sources in every country where all facilities operate, according to the availability and offer. In the base year, 60.48% of the total electric energy purchased by Coster comes from renewable sources, the target is to increase this renewable energy purchased rate at 100% before 2024 and thus reduce absolute Scope 1+2 emissions by 70%. The target status ""revised"" entered in the reporting year is due to the ambition to achieve 100% of green energy purchased instead the previous 90% so we can achieve a reduction of 70% of total emissions (scope 1&2 market based) instead the previous 40% existing target."
"This target is linked to another target set by the company at Group level to reduce waste to landfill (hazardous or non-hazardous) to less than 3% of total waste generated, which is approximately 90 tonnes less than that generated in 2020 and thus reduce the emissions related to their treatment."
"Coty acknowledges the scientific consensus reached at COP 21 when world leaders agreed to reduce carbon emissions to limit global temperatures to within 2°C above preindustrial levels, known as the Paris Agreement. In recognition of the urgent action required, we have a set a target in 2019 based on a 2017 baseline. This target was aligned with a 2°C scenario, with a long-term commitment to reduce carbon emissions by 30% by 2030 and included both a combined scope 1 & 2 target and a target for scopes 1, 2 and 3.  We have significantly reduce our carbon emissions this year due to the COVID 19 impact on our business.Earlier this year, we announced our separation with the Wella Company, which is an important change to our business (and operational boundaries). As a result, we are  recalculating our carbon baseline to reflect the new structure of Coty, including an updated inventory of our Scope 3 emissions. We are now  using this inventory to review how we can strengthen our greenhouse gas reduction target by exploring more ambitious climate scenarios and aim to have the target validated by the Science Based Target initiative in the coming months."

"Coway has set the goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 1% (as an absolute amount) by 2020 compared with 2010. In 2020, Coway's greenhouse gas emissions increased by 379 tCO2e or 7.08% over 2010 as facilities increased."
"This item reports the Scope 1+2 of vendors who have signed a Carbon Partnership with Coway. Coway strives to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions of vendors who participate in Coway's Carbon Partnership. The report is based on 17 vendors who participated in the scheme in 2019. This section reports on the performance of 17 vendors who agreed to Coway's Carbon Partnership. Compared to the base year 2010, the absolute amount decreased by 5,932 tCO2e, or 15.92%, in 2020"
"In 2020, Coway has set a new greenhouse gas emissions reduction target. In terms of operational eco-efficiency, the core of Coway's long-term environmental goals is to achieve 100% renewable energy and carbon neutrality by 2050. RE100(Renewable Energy 100%) & Carbon Emissions ''Net Zero” by 2050(50% Renewable in 2030, 75% in 2040, 100% in 2050).We will cut greenhouse gas emissions by 50 percent by 2030 as compared to 2020 and continue investing in solar power generation with proven effectiveness, and purchasing carbon credits, contributing to a low-carbon society."
"This long-term target is our part of our 2030 Net Zero Carbon ambition. The absolute target covers Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions (market-based) of 3 business units across Thailand (100%), namely; CPALL, CPRAM and Makro. With a projection of annual revenue growth at 8%, we aim to cut the emission at 4.2% reduction from BAU each year  through the implementation of energy efficiency program, solar installation, refrigerant replacement. This self-reduction aligns with science-based target's 1.5 degree scenario in absolute contraction approach. The remaining emission is to be compensated with carbon offset available in Thailand (i.e. T-VER)."
"This medium-term target is our part of our 2030 Net Zero Carbon ambition.

"This emission reduction target involves fugitive emissions. Although this category represents less than 1% of the total Scope 1 emissions, it is one in which our direct action can be decisive in reducing emissions. Our preventive maintenance activities on circuit breakers contributed to a significant reduction in SF6 leaks, which positively affected the CPFL Group's emissions inventory. The air conditioning units in administrative buildings also underwent preventive maintenance programs. Due the above, this target was achieved in 2020, with a 40% of reduction in comparison with the base year.It is worth remembering that 29% of Scope 1 emissions come from EPASA thermal generation, whose dispatch order for electricity generation is controlled by the National Electric System Operator. Due to this special feature, CPFL Energia has no control over when our thermoelectric plants will be activated to generate energy."
"This emission reduction target involves mobile combustion emissions, whose supply and management policies are under our control. CPFL has a policy that regulates the use of ethanol in its fleet vehicles.Mobile combustion emissions at DisCos represented 2.64% of Scope 1 in the base year. In 2020 was an usual year due to te pandemic, which occurs more services using our truck fleet, increasing the Diesel consumption.However, CPFL presented reduction in the last year regarding the optimization of routes and team dispatches, as well as the transfer of 16 electric cars to the company's fleet in 2019, resulting in fuel savings of 53,000 litters.Preventive and scheduled maintenance activities also contributed to fuel savings. It is important to note that in 2019, we installed telemetry equipment in 100% of our fleet, ensuring more accurate data in accounting for emissions. The action provided by CPFL in the previous years demonstrates that the target is underwaying to be achieved."
"This emission reduction target involves land use emissions, whose management policies are under our control. One of the main impacts is associated with the construction of power plants and transmission and distribution lines, which in many cases requires vegetal suppression and can change the local landscape, flora and fauna.In these processes, we carefully conduct all requirements applicable to environmental licensing, minimizing impacts and adequately compensating them. The network layout, for example, is defined considering the least possible impact on isolated forests and trees. In sections where it is not possible to change the location of the towers and wires, we raise the height of the structures to avoid interaction with the local vegetation.One important initiative we have developed in the São Paulo state is the Preserva (""Preservation"") Program, an agreement with CETESB that allows us to unify the terms of an environmental recovery commitment and to carry interest. In this way, trees are planted in concentrated areas, enhancing the effect of habitat preservation and combating climate change. In addition, this enables a cost reduction of around R$ 224,000 per year.Also worth mentioning is the Manejo Integrado de Vegetação em Linhas de Transmissão (""Integrated Management of Vegetation along Transmission Lines"" - MIVE). This solution permits the replacement of trees that are incompatible with the transmission networks with shrub species that grow to smaller sizes and, at the same time, maintain the environmental quality of the areas where the assets are installed.At the distribution companies, the reduction of plant cover in cities is inherent to pruning activities that contribute to ensuring the availability of energy supply and to the population's safety. To minimize this environmental impact, we carried out Arborização + Segura, a project to substitute trees and donate seedlings to restore green areas."
"Following the adoption of several measures including 100% use of electricity derived from renewable sources across its French sites, the Group has set itself a new greenhouse gas reduction target, encompassing energy, transportation and procurement, by 2020. Scope 3 corresponds to business travel (air, train). This requires each Group entity to implement action plans to reduce energy consumption in their buildings and data centers, as well as the carbon footprint of employee travel.The action plans taken at the various entities have been successful as the greenhouse gas emissions of scope 1 and scope 2 have decreased by 3% and 8% between 2016 and 2019.In 2020, operating emissions fell drastically due to the health crisis, by 12% (scope 1) and 4% (scope 2) respectively compared to 2019, or by 12% (scope 1) and 15% (scope 2) compared to 2016. Also compared to 2016, emissions on the energy and transport items having decreased by 16% and 87% respectively, we recorded a drop of 37% in our total direct emissions.As our five years targets (2016-2020) have been achieved, we have set new targets aligned with our NZBA commitment. These new targets will be submitted for approval to the SBTi.  Three milestones will therefore be set up : for 2025, 2030 and 2050."
"The methodology chosen for target setting is the SBT initiative's 1,5°C Absolute Contraction Approach initiative, which foresees an identical linear reduction of emissions for all sectors. The objective of this trajectory in 2050 is to achieve carbon neutrality, implying a reduction of 4,2% emissions per year. We have set two intermediate target in 2025 and 2030.The data used to calculate this trajectory at group's  level are 2019 data from our extra-financial reporting platform and verified by an Independent part. 2019 was chosen as the reference year, because 2020 was not representative (covid crisis). Conversion factors have been updated from 2019.  This target will be submitted at the Science-Based Targets initiative before september 2022."

"We continuously review our environmental strategy to ensure best practices are implemented into our daily management processes. We have strengthened our commitment to environmental management by introducing 2025 environmental objectives, one of which is to reduce total greenhouse gas emissions by 75% with regard to the aspects based on which emissions from our operational activities are reported, relative to 2010 levels.Our objective is based on the system boundaries defined by the VfU Indicators Standard (Version 2018). It includes 100% of our Scope 1 and Scope 2 Market Based emissions, and several Scope 3 emission categories, the most important ones being business travel and fuel-and-energy-related activities (not included in Scope 1 or 2) as reported in question C6.5.In 2020 we have achieved the target, due to substantial impacts from the pandemic, particularly relating to Scope 3 emissions in business travel."
"We are committed to enabling a more environmentally sustainable economy and we recognize climate change as one of the most significant risks facing our planet. In 2020, we set a new ambition to achieve net zero emissions by no later than 2050.At the Investor Update in December 2020, we announced our ambition to align our activities with the Paris Agreement objective of limiting global warming to 1.5°C. As guidance towards this goal, we are committed to develop science-based targets and a full scope base year in 2021 and 2022  for achieving net zero emissions from our operations, supply chain and financing activities by no later than 2050, with intermediate emissions targets to be set for 2030."
"The target for 2024 mainly considered energy efficiency interventions in buildings. The pandemic context of 2020 and the consolidation activities of the sites of the commercial network (already started in 2019) allowed the target to be reached in considerable advance of the estimated date. For these reasons, a strategic plan for 2023 was defined in 2020, the results of which are reported in the following targets."
The objective at 2023 was calculated assuming the following areas of activity:? Real estate interventions (-866 Ton CO2 eq);? Installation of supervision systems (-183 Ton CO2 eq);? Replacement of lighting systems (-356 Ton CO2 eq);? Effect of smart working for new company policies (-315 Ton CO2 eq);? Rationalization of the sales network (-91 Ton CO2 eq).
The objective at 2023 was calculated assuming the following areas of activity:? Real estate interventions (-124 Ton CO2 eq);? Reduction of the mileage of the cars of the company fleet due to the smart working and the new corporate policies (-194 Ton CO2 eq);? Rationalization of the sales network (-24 Ton CO2 eq).The objective and numerical values of the reported emissions have not taken into account emissions due to escaping refrigerant gas from the air-conditioning systems.
The target at 2023 was calculated assuming the following scope of activity:? Reduction of mileage of private cars of employees by service due to smart working and new company policies (-327 Ton CO2 eq).
"Our SBTs are company-wide, relating to all locations and activities and commit us to reduce our absolute scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 46.2% by 2029 from a 2018 base year. The targets covering GHG emissions from company operations (scopes 1 & 2) are consistent with reductions required to keep warming to 1.5 Degrees Celsius."
"Our SBTs are company-wide, relating to all locations and activities and commit us to reduce our upstream scope 3 GHG emissions by 13.5% by 2029 from a 2018 base year. The targets covering GHG emissions from company operations (upstream scope 3) are consistent with reductions required to keep warming to 2 Degrees Celsius."
"This is a company-wide target, relating to all locations and activities and commit us to reduce scope 1 & 2 (market-based) emissions by 25% from a 2018 base year. The targets covering GHG emissions from company operations (scopes 1 & 2) are consistent with reductions required to keep warming to 1.5 Degrees Celsius.  This commits us to a linear reduction in emissions over the period 2018-2030"
"This is a company-wide target, that we made public in July 2019 by signing up to the United Nations' Business Ambition to 1.5°C and  relates to all locations and activities and commit us to be a Net Zero organisation by 2050 from a 2018 base year. The targets covering GHG emissions from company operations (scopes 1, 2 & 3) are consistent with reductions required to keep warming to 1.5 Degrees Celsius."
"Crown has committed to reduce absolute scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions 50% by 2030 from a 2019 base year. Covered emissions in the base year have been reported as they were reported to SBTi with the target. Since setting this target, more data has become available for inventory reporting, so covered emissions in reporting year reflect this lower emissions value."
"Covered emissions in 2019 base year were rebaselined and updated to 12,117,585. Crown has committed to reduce absolute Scope 3 GHG emissions from Purchased Goods and Services by 16% by 2030 from a 2019 baseline."
"We achieved our 2020 target reduction 1 year early. Our target aimed to decrease emissions by 75% (47.23 mt CO2e) by 2020 of our base year emissions (62.97 mt CO2e).  In 2019, our scope 2 market-based emissions totalled 13.42  mt CO2e, a reduction of 78.7%.  The % reduction was calculated via the following formulas: (13.42-62.97)/62.97 = 78.7%.  Therefore, our % achieved toward our goal was calculated as follows: 78.7%/75% =104.9%.  Since we achieved this early, in 2020 we purchased RECs for 100% of our market-based electricity use (Scope 2) emissions."
"Here we calculated the emission from all locations of our company, including factories in Taiwan, Vietnam and Philippines also business locations in Taiwan, the US, Netherland and China. The total CO2e is 109,063."
"Over the past years, CTBC has been expanding the boundary of the GHG inventory. From 2019, the boundary of the inventory has increased from 81% in 2017 to 100% (the number of operating sites included in inventory were 175 in 2017 and 217 in 2019 respectively). Therefore, the emissions in the base year (2017) here are also based on the new boundary: the total amount of 55,621 tons of CO2e consists of the actual emissions of 43,381 tons of CO2e in 2017 plus the emissions of the newly-added inventory sites 12,240 tons of CO2e.In 2020, CTBC's Scope 1 and 2 emissions are 41,906 tons of CO2e in total, which has been decreased by 3.4% compared to base year due to the effectiveness of energy conservation plan."
"Based on the historical database and experience, CTBC has determined medium-term GHG emissions reduction target in 2020. Our 5-year target reflects around annual 1% linear reduction from base year. We are also focusing on developing the long-term target through SBT to meet net-zero goals."
"(1). The target covers 100% Scope 1+2 emissions of CTCI, including headquarters and construction sites.(2). CTCT's gross GHG emissions are 15,177 and 9,942 metric tones CO2e in the base year 2018 and the reporting year 2020, respectively. The target in 2025 is 15.4% reduction compared to the base year, equal to 12,840 metric tone CO2e.(3). The % of target achieved = (15,177-9,942)/(15,177-12,840) = 224%(4). The % of time achieved = (2020-2018)/(2025-2018) = 28.6%"
When initiated 2017 we tried to set realistic targets on direct emmissions
"CTT commits to reduce absolute carbon emissions 30% (scopes 1, 2 and 3) from 2013 to 2025 and received the SBTi approval for this absolute science-based emissions reduction target in 2017, by the Science Based Targets initiative. CTT already achieved a significant reduction in overall CO2 emissions (83.3% achieved by the end of 2020, representing 25% of the 30% targeted) since the baseline year.Percentage of time, by the end of 2019, was 58% (58% = 7/12 = (2020-2013)/(2025-2013))."

This target includes the Scope 2 emissions (of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol) generated from the energy purchased for electricity and heating."
"In terms of Section 6 of the South African National Climate Change Response Policy (NCCRP), the government sets out the overall approach to climate change mitigation including the allocation of carbon budgets at a company level. The implementation of the voluntary phase I carbon budgets was from 01 January 2016 to 31 December 2020, and it was based on the carbon budget design document. In implementing the voluntary carbon budget process, the Department of Environment, Forestry and Fisheries (DEFF) had extensive engagements with our SA operation on the methodological approach and GHG emissions data for determining the voluntary phase 1 carbon budget allocation. Therefore, this target was set only in our South Africa operation on a voluntary basis (Phase 1). However, phase 2 will commence from 2023, which will now become a mandatory regulatory requirement. 2021 and 2022 has been given as an extension of the voluntary phase 1.At Company level, DCP has not yet set targets related to climate change as we have only just started the process of addressing the topic. Once we are satisfied with the accuracy and completeness of our baseline data at other geographies, we will be in a better position to make informed decisions on setting targets."
"Target covers all scope 1 and 2 emissions in the company's GHG inventory, developed in line with the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard. Targets for scope 1 and 2 emissions cover 100% of the company's inventory. Danieli's absolute target on scope 1 has been calculated by using the base year emission referred to both the plant and steel making segment. Danieli's absolute target on scope 2 (location-based) has been calculated by using the base year emission referred to the steel making facility in Italy, which accounted for 95% of the Groups emissions in 2017. The emissions of the plant making segment of the Danieli Group were excluded from base year information but the value was only 5% of the total and not heavily impacting. Overall base year emission coverage is 97% of the total. Target coverage has been approved as company-wide, and takes into account Danieli & C. Officine Meccaniche S.p.A., the headquarter, and its subsidiaries in accordance with the operational control method. The Science Based Targets initiative assessed Danieli Group's official submission against the Call to Action's eligibility criteria and, after careful review, approved the targets. Danieli Group submitted separate scope 1 and scope 2(location-based) targets in this submission. When combined, the targets for scope 1 and 2 emissions lead to a reduction of absolute emissions 36% by 2030 from a 2017 base year, which exceeds the minimum ambition for well-below 2°C pathway defined by the absolute contraction approach and is therefore considered ambitious. In particular, the percentage of reduction of the absolute target of Scope 1 is 15% and the percentage of reduction of the absolute target of Scope 2 (location-based) is 55%. Danieli Group commits to reduce absolute scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions 36% by 2030 from a 2017 base year. Danieli Group's target submission for scope 3 emissions is a reduction of emissions 62% per dollar value added by 2030 from a 2017 base year. Using the projected growth rate in dollar value added provided by the company, the target is estimated to lead to a reduction in absolute emissions of 43% over the target period, which exceeds the minimum ambition for well-below 2°C pathway defined by the absolute contraction approach and is therefore also considered ambitious."
"Target covers all scope 1 and 2 emissions in the company's GHG inventory, developed in line with the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard. Targets for scope 1 and 2 emissions cover 100% of the company's inventory.

Hence, both the target year and base year the coverage is company-wide. It considers Danieli & C. Officine Meccaniche S.p.A., the headquarter, and its subsidiaries in accordance with the operational control. In 2019, the Science Based Targets initiative assessed, review and approved Danieli Group's targets. Danieli Group commits to reduce absolute scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions 36% by 2030 from a 2017 base year. In particular, the percentage of reduction of the absolute target of Scope 1 is 15%. Using the projected growth rate in dollar value added provided by the company, the target is estimated to lead to a reduction in absolute emissions which exceeds the minimum ambition for well-below 2°C pathway defined by the absolute contraction approach and is therefore also considered ambitious. The target Abs1 has been updated to better align it to the Science-Based targets approved in 2019.The target calculated with the Science Based Target tool has been achieved. To comment such achievement, it is underlined that the steel making segment, hence the one which has a higher materiality compared to the total, strongly invested in new technological green solutions. For instance, it has been done ad investment of eight millions of euro to control the facility fumes, the efficiency has been incremented. Such investment permitted to reduce the diffused emissions thanks to the latest generation technological parts, which had higher power with lower electrical energy necessities. The new plant started to work fully by the end of the solar year 2018. The total potential of the new plant permitted to aspire 1,500,000 m3/h with an improvement of 15% compared to the previous standards. The improvement is not only linked to the aspiration fan but also to the efficiency of the filters and, hence, treatment of the fumes aspired. In addition, there is a fumes control system which monitors parameters continuously according to local rules and laws."

"Emissions covered by the target cover energy consumptions from Danone plants and distribution centers owned or under operational control of Danone, as well as emission from Danone's vehicles fleet (management cars for Danone employees and sales force).According to a conservative approach at most 5% of the emissions are excluded from energy consumptions in offices.This Science-based target has been defined in 2017, referring to a baseline year in 2015.The reported figure in % achieved is calculated on a like for like basis and methodology relative to 2015.Danone has set its scope 1 and 2 emissions target according to the GHG Protocol market-based method, so as to reflect the share of renewables in its energy mix.Total emissions in metric tons of CO2 equivalent for scopes 1 and 2 fell by 12.4% between 2019 and 2020, mainly due to purchases of electricity from renewable energy sources and energy efficiency improvements.On a like-for-like basis, these emissions decreased by 11.5% relative to 2019 and by 38.1% relative to 2015.Danone is a member of the working group led by the Science-Based Target Initiative (SBTi) to define sectoral 1.5°C trajectories."
"Company-wide CO2 emission reduction target: The Group target for 2023 is a 75% reduction of total CO2 emissions from both Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 compared to 2010 figures (baseline 55690 tonnes CO2).  This 2023 target for reduction of our own emissions has been set in accordance with the methodology set out by the Science Based Targets initiative. Moreover, we are currently in the process of calibrating this target and working towards having an updated target approved by the Science Based Targets initiative in the near future.Scope 1 entails our direct CO2 emissions from heating produced by oil and gas, as well as transportation in company cars. In the calculations of Scope 2, we include CO2 emissions stemming from electricity and heating production purchased from external suppliers. Scope 3 encompasses the CO2 emissions produced by paper consumption, air transportation and use of employees' own cars for activities related to company operations.In 2020, our operations resulted in 7,871 tonnes of CO2 emissions, which is a 48% decrease from 2019 ((7871-14868)/14868)*100). Since the significant decrease in CO2 emissions is mainly caused by the corona pandemic, and we expect consumption figures to increase again as employees return to pre-pandemic routines, our current 2023 target will be maintained without change. Key initiatives towards our 2023 target include more digital meetings, energy-efficient buildings, environmentally friendly company cars and reduction in air travel. Moreover, in 2020 we committed to setting a climate target by 2023 for our corporate loan portfolio in alignment with the climate goals of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. To guide our work in this area Danske Bank joined the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF), an industry-led partnership that aims to develop and implement a harmonized approach, based on the GHG Protocol, to measuring and disclosing GHG emissions associated with loans and investments. By end of 2020, we had mapped 23% of our corporates loan portfolio."

We have achieved the absolute Scope 1+2 emissions of the Science Based Targets (SBT) for this phase and advanced fulfilling 1.5°C road map of Delta's SBT for 2025.% of time achieved: (2020-2014)*100% / (2025-2014) = 55%% of target achieved: (348,179-176,758)*100% / (348,179-278,543) = 246%"
"(1). In 2017, Delta committed its SBT for Scope 3 to increase the average efficiency of server power supplies in the use of its sold products 1.6% by 2022 from a 2016 base year, which equates to reducing absolute GHG emissions in scope 3 by over 20%. Our average server power supplies efficiency was 93.4% in 2016 base year, the energy-efficiency target was set at 95% which exceeds the 80 Plus Titanium Certification standard of 94.2%, the current highest standard.(2). The 2016 inventory result indicates that the emission coverage from server power constituted 72.71% of our total scope 3 emissions and 82.05% of our total category (Use of Sold Product) emissions. In 2020, it constituted 81.6% of our total scope 3 emissions and 73.2% of our total category (Use of Sold Product) emissions.(3). The GHG emissions of Scope 3 in the reporting year 2020 was 322,879 ton-CO2e, which was a 16.4% absolute emissions increased from base year 2016.  Despite the average efficiency of server power was enhanced of 0.6%, the Scope 3 target was not achieved because of the shipment growing by 30% from the last year. % of time achieved: (2020-2016)*100% / (2022-2016) = 67%% of target achieved: (322,879-202,961)*100% / (277,408-221,926) = -82%"

This scope forms part of our annual scope 1 and 2 reporting process.  The target reduction is 46.2% aligned with a 1.5C SBT approved by the SBTi.
"The emissions associated with Scope 3 for this reporting year were not completed under a full emissions report.  Dentsu International aims to conduct a full Scopes 1, 2 and 3 emissions report every other year from the baseline year of our Net Zero strategy (2019). Therefore, this year only Scopes 1 and 2 were completed using actual data.  To calculate and estimate these Scope 3 emissions for 2020 we used the equivalent rate of emissions to revenue based on 2019 figures.  This figure is almost certainly an over-estimate due to the highly significant reductions in travel and business generally due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  However, this is preferable to not reporting or underrepresenting our Scope 3 emissions."

"Using the Science-Based Target Initiative SBRi-Tool, we need to recognize a 42% reduction over 10 years to meet the requirements for 1.5C(tCO2e).  This requires meeting a 4.2% reduction per year for 10 year.  Due to Covid, we exceeded our reduction goal, however, we anticipate an increase in future years."
"We set a goal to reduce GHG emissions from our operations to 20% below 2018 levels by December 31, 2024. This target includes emissions from buildings under our operational control, business travel and paper consumption.In 2020, our emissions stood at 20,026 metric tons of CO2 equivalent, down 46% from 2018. This drop is in part due to our efforts, but also to the effects of the pandemic (less business travel and paper use). We'll be keeping a close eye on our emissions in 2021 and may likely revise our 2024 target.The well below 2°C alignment of this target was estimated based on the SBT Tool v1.2.1 published by the SBTi (well below 2°C alignment = 15.0% reduction between 2018 and 2024)."
"In 2019, we set a target of reducing our greenhouse gas emissions linked to paper consumption to 32% below 2018 levels by December 31, 2024. This program, dubbed the Paper Challenge, covers all the paper and printed products purchased by Desjardins Group. Initiatives to reduce our paper use have been put in place for internal printing, account statements and other paper documents, forms, and marketing. In cases where paper cannot be eliminated for business or regulatory reasons, we will opt for a paper made of 100% recycled fibres.The 1.5°C alignment of this target was estimated based on the SBT Tool v1.2.1 published by the SBTi (1.5°C alignment = 29.4% reduction between 2018 and 2024)."

DB's Integrated Report is validated and audited by external auditors. In 2021, the Management Board decided to move the Group's climate neutrality forward by 10 years from 2050 to 2040, thus accelerating climate protection activities. We will report this target starting next year. In the explanation of our strategy in chapters 1-3, we already use the updated target."
"The 2025 target value for absolute GHG emissions correlates with the 2025 target value for the Group's specific GHG reduction target from the medium-term planning 2021-25 approved by DB Group's Management Board (see C4.1b, ""int1""). This Group target is monitored during the year and is part of the official medium-term planning process in the Group; the result is communicated in DB's annual Integrated Report and is validated or audited by auditors. The development of absolute GHG emissions is not officially reported or communicated but is used for internal management purposes."
"We have a target to reduce total energy consumption by 20% by 2025 from a 2019 base year, with an interim target of reducing energy by 10% by 2022. Our carbon reduction targets are to reduce scope 1 emissions by 3% by 2021 from a 2019 base year, and scope 2 emissions by 7% by 2021 from a 2019 base year. We also have a target to source all (100%) electricity from renewable sources by 2025. Target coverage includes all scope 1 and 2 emissions with no exclusions.

"In a first step, CO2 emissions per working place are expected to be cut by 50 per cent until 2021 to the year 2019, with direct measures that help to prevent CO2 emissions. Those will include a switch in the energy supply of office buildings towards renewable energies, the carbon neutralisation of business trips as well as an advanced infrastructure for e-mobility on-site.In a second step, these measures will be further enhanced to reduce emissions by another 20 percentage points by 2023. In a third step, the remaining 30 per cent base of annual emissions will be offset by real compensation of emissions from 2025 onwards with external projects e.g. through afforestation."

"Percentage of emissions in scope relates to all production sites Lufthansa Technik AG and its subsidiaries worldwide. Reduction target of Lufthansa Technik AG production sites in metric tons CO2: 32,444. Note: special reduction effect caused by the output reduction due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the carve-out of significant production capacities associated with their transfer to Lufthansa. Attention: Lufthansa Technik is a provider of maintenance, repair and overhaul services (MRO) for civilian commercial and governmental aircraft. For this sector no science-based targets methodology could be identified."
"Percentage of emissions in scope relates to the LH Group aircraft fleet (passenger and cargo). Note: special reduction effect caused by the output reduction due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Target aligns with the still existing IATA industry goal of reducing absolute carbon emissions by 50% by 2050, compared to 2005 levels. IATA is currently reviewing the target for 2050.

"In March 2019 the Lufthansa Group Executive Board adopted the goal of supplying 100% of Lufthansa Group electricity consumption in buildings in Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Belgium with 100% green electricity from 2020. To this end, Lufthansa has acquired green power certificates, which guarantee the production of green electricity from new power plants, thus contributing to the expansion of renewable energy. For Buildings that were fully and directly owned or rented by Lufthansa, Lufthansa was able to reach the target of a 100% reduction, since LH was able to buy certificates for these locations. The rented and non-owned buildings in this region accounted for a residual of only 4.473 tons of CO2."

"With our ""Mission 2050: Zero Emissions"" we set ourselves a set of environmental targets including this absolute target (Abs1) and extended our Intensity Target to 2025 (see Int1 below). This new target is based on 2016. It is expected that decoupling emissions and sector growth will only happen over the next 15 years. Therefore, absolute emissions are still expected to increase, but at a slower speed than sector growth. This is also the reason for setting and managing our 2025 intensity target (see Int1 below).This target includes 100% of Scopes 1 and 2 emissions, plus Scope 3 emissions from categories 4 (Upstream transportation and distribution) and category 6 (Business travel)."
"The Board of Deutsche Telekom decided on new much more ambitious climate change targets as climate change is one of DT´s top priorities within the corporate responsibility strategy, which is integrated part of the overall group strategy. Due to the merger between TM US and Sprint by April 1st 2020, we adjust the base year emissions from 2,896,000 to 4,030,155 t. The new baseline includes the emissions from Sprint in 2017.With the new climate change targets DT committed to reduce 4.030 mio t. of carbon emissions in 2017 to 0.403 mio tons of carbon emissions in 2030.  In 2020 the carbon emissions have been reduced by 1.094 mio. tons of carbon against the baseline form 2017. This means within the first three years (25% of the time) 41.86 % of the targeted emission reductions (1.518 mio. t from 4.030 mio. t) have been achieved, mainly by increasing the share of electricity from renewable energy."
"TM US has an officially validated Science-Based Target. T-Mobile commits to reduce combined absolute Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions 95% by 2025 from a 2016 base year. This commitment includes emissions from Sprint, which was acquired by T-Mobile in 2020. With all current and future reporting values now consolidated under the T-Mobile brand, the base year emissions value was adjusted to account for historical Sprint emissions to allow for an accurate comparison.TM USr emissions declined by 7% in 2020 Y/Y as we have taken steps to expand our network while signing renewable energy deals that will help us meet our target."
"In 2017 we switched the methodology for the measurement of our target achievement from a location based approach with fixed IEA emission factors from 2008 to a market based approach. This leads to a significant lower baseline of 1.481 mio. t instead of 2.601 mio. t due to the fact that the electricity in Germany came from renewable energy sources by RECS certificates in 2008. Currently only half of our electricity consumed in Germany comes from renewable energy sources as due to critics on these certificates DT bought no renewable energy certificates from 2013 to 2016.  Due to the new Greenhouse Gas Protocol Guidance on Scope 2 Emissions, we see our environment changed that is now not only (contrary to 2010) not only possible but increasingly demanded by investors to use and to account electricity from renewable sources. We are planning to increase the purchases of electricity from renewable sources in Germany up to 100% till 2020 and are optimistic that we receive our corporate emission reduction target. T-Mobile US is not included within our emission reduction target but has developed an own very ambitious emission reduction target in-between (see Abs 2). In 2020 we reduced the respective emissions by 0.562 mio. t, although this target was already achieved in 2019. While the target was 20% emission reduction against 2008 by 2020, we achieved nearly 55% reduction."
"In 2017 we switched the methodology for the measurement of our target achievement from a location based approach with fixed IEA emission factors from 2008 to a market based approach. This leads to a significant lower baseline of 0.368 mio. t instead of 1.471 mio. t due to the fact that the electricity in Germany came from renewable energy sources by RECS certificates in 2008. Currently only the half of our electricity consumed in Germany comes from renewable energy sources as due to critics on these certificates DT bought no renewable energy certificates from 2013 to 2016.  Due to the new Greenhouse Gas Protocol Guidance on Scope 2 Emissions, we see our environment changed that is now (contrary to 2010) not only possible but increasingly demanded by investors to use and to account electricity from renewable sources. We had 100% electricity from renewable sources in Germany in 2020 and by this achieved our German carbon emission reduction target. In 2020 the emissions have been 0.226 mio. t below the base year and 0.330 mio. t below the emissions in 2019."

"PLEASE NOTE, as explained in C0.1, on January 7, 2021, Devon and WPX Energy, Inc. (WPX) completed an all-stock merger of equals. Financial and operational performance data, such as production, revenue and emissions, provided in this document exclude amounts related to WPX's assets unless otherwise noted due to the Merger closing subsequent to December 31, 2020. However, certain prospective information included within this document is reflective of the post-merger company. The above target was established in 2021 following the merger with WPX. As such, the ""Covered emissions in base year"", ""Covered emissions in reporting year"", and ""% of target achieved"" are estimates for the post-merger, combined company and are subject to change. Pro-forma performance metrics, including the target baseline and historical performance, will be disclosed in Devon's 2021 Sustainability Report to be released later this year. As noted above, financial and operational performance throughout the rest of this report excludes amounts related to WPX's assets, unless otherwise noted. In June 2021, Devon established a target to achieve net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for Scopes 1 and 2 by 2050. Since our founding in 1971, Devon has been at the forefront of technological innovation in the oil and natural gas industry. The company's long history of using advanced technologies to improve efficiencies across the business will be key to delivering on our ambition to achieve net zero GHG emissions for Scopes 1 and 2 by 2050.In pursuit of continued transparency, Devon will refresh our Climate Change Assessment Report by year-end 2021, outlining our approach to proactively address climate-related risks and opportunities."
"The absolute target established is: ''Reduce 25% of Duratex's direct emissions (Scope 1)” in relation to the base year (2012). It was developed in 2016, based on a review of Duratex's material themes that resulted in the company's Sustainability Strategy, to be started in 2017. This target covers Duratex's operations in Brazil, excluding the Ceramic Coatings business. In 2012, Duratex's participation in the capital of Tablemac (currently Duratex Colombia) went from 25% to 37%, and its emissions have not yet been accounted for, so the percentage of Scope emissions was 100% in the base year. In 2020, the operations contemplated in the target would represent 95.58% of direct emissions. Currently, the Strategy and its targets are under review, with the aim of establishing a science-based emission target. Considering the projections made at the time the milestones were drawn up, the emissions from Duratex's Brazilian operations in 2020, which include the Deca (Metals and Ceramics), Hydra and Wood (Forest and Panels) divisions, and being accounted for for the first time, Ceramic Coating , totaled 270,958.25 tCO2e, above the expected milestone for 2020 (203,218.69 tCO2e). The increase in the company's absolute emissions of approximately 9% was due to acquisitions and expansions in the Ceramic Coatings area. The expected evolution to reach the goal in 2025 was not linear, since variable production projections were considered.It is important to highlight that Duratex is revisiting its emissions targets, including for the Colombia and Ceramic Coating units. The expectation is to disclose the goals with a scientific basis in 2021, together with the Company's new Sustainability Strategy.  The goals are to reduce emissions and maintain a positive carbon balance within the business."
"Within its 2015 Annual Review, Dexus set a target to ""Reduce energy consumption and emissions across the Group by a further 10% by 2020 using the FY15 baseline."" This target involves achieving a reduction in energy and subsequent Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions from purchased electricity and natural gas from Australian properties across the office, industrial and retail portfolios where Dexus has operational control measured on a financial year compared to a FY15 baseline. It was determined that it is more appropriate for Dexus to report and benchmark on a like for like portfolio due to property acquisitions and disposals and changes of operational control within the portfolios."
"This target is nominated as applying to a Business Activity as it applies across all Office properties, a subset of the group property portfolio. Within its 2015 Annual Review, Dexus set a target to ""Deliver 1,000,000 square metres of office space rated at least 5 Star NABERS Energy rating.""  Together the baseline NABERS rating for these assets was 4.7 stars average and the targeted improvement is equivalent to a 11.7% reduction in GHG emissions.  GHG emissions savings will result from implementing energy efficiency projects under Dexus's NABERS Improvement Program."
"Dexus has committed to reduce scope 1 and scope 2 emissions by 70% by 2030 relative to a 2018 base year, in line with the Science-based target initiative sectoral decarbonisation approach for real estate.  This supports a broader target which by Dexus has committed to achieve a net zero position for all carbon emissions across the group's managed property portfolio by 2030, which requires a 100% reduction, or net-zero scope 1, 2 emissions by 2030 across Dexus's operational control boundary.  The SBT will be achieved through operational efficiency and renewable energy. The net zero emissions target will extend this, and be supported by minimal offsets to achieve a net zero position.Please refer to the C-FI Further Information section of the Dexus response, where confirmation of approval from the SBTi is attached."

"DG3's CO2e emission reduction target is 2% per year since 2013, which was the highest since 1999.   Based on the data for the last 4 years, DG3 was able to achieve about  2.% reduction per year on the emission of CO2e ."
"DGB Financial Group has an absolute target to reduce GHG emissions based on 2020 scope 1+2 emission. DGB Financial Group has conducted annual GHG emissions verification for five affiliates, including holding companies and bank. At the end of 2018, Hi Investment & Securities was acquired, and from 2020, four affiliates and their branches including HI Investment & Securities were added to the scope of verification. As all the branches of affiliates were included in the reporting scope, emissions increased significantly, and the target emissions appear abnormal. Although Daegu Bank and HI Investment & Securities account for almost all of the emissions, investigating more accurate emissions for the remaining subsidiaries is the first step toward clearly setting the group's long-term emission reduction goals and expanding environmental management in the future."
"In 2020, the amount of LNG used to operate cafeteria has been significantly reduced, and the amount of diesel used as automobile fuel has also been significantly reduced to achieve the Scope3 Fuel-and-energy-related activities emission target. However  this sharp decline is a temporary phenomenon that occurred due to the decrease in cafeteria use and external visits due to COVID-19. Therefore, we try to keep the target as it is."

Lean & Green Project implementation is delayed from the expected timing, delaying the objectives achievement as well.However, even though DIA has gained in efficiency of the routes, we have increased service frequency of the routes in Spain which has resulted in an increase of the logistic emissions in this country."
"Dia Group has set an absolute goal to achieve 45% reductions in Scope1 (diffused emissions) + Scope 2 total emissions, that means 80% of total Scope 1 + Scope 2 emissions.For difussed emissions, this goal will be met by the replacement of the gases currently used in stores & warehouse commercial refrigeration by others considered the most environmentally sustainable; by the improvement of refrigeration equipments efficiency & by the improvement of leak control.Regarding Scope 2 emissions, this goal will be met by implementing energy efficiency measures related with lighting & commercial refrigeration."
"Dia Group has set an absolute goal to achieve 40% reductions in Scope3, in the waste emisions category (that means 12.68% of total Scope 3 emissions).This goal will be met by the progressive implementation of a new waste management system that promotes the separation in origin of these waste products that could be recovered, recycled or valorized, preventing its deposit in landfield."
"Absolute Carbon emissions, (market-based), have been reduced by 50.1%, since the base year of 2007, versus a 50% target to be achieved by 2020.

CO2 emissions are calculated on a market basis.3.  We invest approximately ¥1,000 million in energy-saving and decarbonization initiatives and implement around 500 such initiatives, both large and small, annually.4.  Renewable energy used includes wood biomass boilers, wind power and solar power. Renewable energy accounts for approximately 15% of total energy used by DIC Group sites in Japan.5.  We are expanding our generating capacity for solar power for internal use annually. At present, our solar power generating capacity in Japan is 4,341 kW.6. The principal contributing factor was the acquisition in 2015 of a polymer production facility (KJ Chemicals Corporation; annual CO2 emissions: 1,000 tonnes).7. Our DIC Report discloses CO2 emissions of our domestic plants, which are measured using marginal power sources, because our CO2 power generation from renewable energies and other sources is regarded as a marginal power source (-14654 tons). Therefore, the official CO2 emissions in Japan are 194364 t-."
"1.The DIC Group has decided to set new targets to reduce carbon net zero by 2050 and Scope 1, Scope 2 by 50% (compared to fiscal 2013) by 2030, and has publicly announced them externally. This condition conforms to the SBT requirements.2. With 162 overseas sites scattered across Europe, North America, South America, the Asia–Pacific region, the PRC, Taiwan and Africa, it is important for corporate headquarters to calculate CO2 emissions appropriately and efficiently. We thus decided that a market-based method of calculation, as is used in Japan, was not suitable, and the decision was made to calculate CO2 emissions attributable to purchased electric power at overseas sites using a location-based method (the global average announced by the International Energy Agency (IEA)).3. MHI is working to make energy consumption visible and to establish a practical manual for energy management, focusing on reducing wasteful energy consumption, such as reducing equipment loss.4. Biomass boilers, biogas utilization, photovoltaic power generation, and small hydroelectric power generation are adopted as renewable energy, and about 7% of energy consumed by overseas business sites is covered by renewable energy.5. Solar power generation capacity for private consumption has been increased every year, and it is 2104kW at present."

"The target here is to eliminate routine methane emissions at the Tawke license operations in Kurdistan in accordance with DNO's policy of zero venting during routine operations (see also C-OG4.2d and C-OG4.6). In the base year (2016) an estimated 29.6 million standard cubic feet (MMscf) of gas, equivalent to approximately 14,516 tonnes of CO2e) were emitted through venting and therefore this is selected as the ''Covered emissions” for this target.This figure compares to a total of 98,384 tCO2e of scope 1 emissions in the Tawke license in 2016. Therefore, venting emissions were about 15% of total Tawke license scope 1 emissions (14,516/98,384) .The project goal is to eliminate all venting in the Tawke license through diversion of all the gas to a low-pressure flare system. Therefore, although methane emissions are eliminated, there remain residual emissions of about 1,800 tCO2e from flared gas instead (29.6 MMscf of gas*60.8 tCO2e/MMscf=1,800 tCO2e). This translates to a reduction of 14,516-1,800=12,716  tCO2e or 87% (12,716/14,516) compared to the base year. This project was completed during 2018. DNO's goal to maintain its goal of zero flaring during routine operations going forward."
"Development of the Peshkabir field in the Tawke license in the Kurdistan region of Iraq commenced in 2017. As is typical in the region gas was planned to be flared. However, the oil produced at Peshkabir had higher than expected associated gas content. Consequently, the Tawke license became by far the largest contributor to DNO's GHG emissions, (598,222 tonnes CO2e in 2019). For this reason, in 2019 a target was set for the emissions at Tawke license to be reduced by at least two-third (66.67%) within five years (by 2024). The target was set for this facility (the Tawke license) as it is the largest source of DNO's scope emissions (598,222/632,512=95%).The reduction of emissions was to be achieved through a two-phase gas injection project (instead of flaring). The first phase of the project (commissioned in mid 2020) involved capturing and processing associated gas produced at the Peshkabir field and pipelining it to the nearby Tawke field (within the same license). At the Tawke filed, the transported gas is injected underground for reservoir pressure management. The cost of this project was USD 110 million. By end of 2020, DNO captured, pipelined and reinjected a total of 2.4 billion cubic feet (bcf) of Peshkabir field associated gas - which otherwise would have been flared - into the Tawke field for pressure maintenance (in addition to another 0.3 bcf reinjected at the Peshkabir field itself). Phase 2 of the project will capture and reinject into the Tawke field any associated gas produced at the Tawke filed. This project is in the final stages of review before contract award and it is expected to finish in 2022-2023 at cost of USD 30 million. This project will materially reduce flaring of associated gas at the Tawke field and help with reservoir pressure maintenance and oil recovery.Once Phase 1&2 are commissioned, flaring emissions in the Tawke license will drop significantly. Although uncertain (depending on reservoir performance), we forecast in 2024, on an average, 21 MMscf (million standard cubic feet) per day of otherwise flared associated gas will be injected. This compares to 22.1 MMscf per day of associated gas flaring in 2019.Although uncertain, we forecast total GHG emissions of Tawke license (containing both Tawke and Peshkabir field) on a Scope 1 basis to be around 211,000 tCO2e in 2024  compared to 598,222 tCO2e (reduction of 65%)."
"This target is part of our commitment to achieve Net Zero carbon and methane emissions by 2050. This target is for a 55% carbon emissions reduction by 2030  for our electric generation compared to a 2005 baseline. Under our net zero strategy, the company will reduce carbon emissions 55 percent by 2030 from our power generation business compared to 2005 levels. We will likewise reduce methane emissions from our natural gas business by 65 percent by 2030 and 80 percent by 2040 (from 2010 levels). Further, the company has committed to invest in carbon-beneficial renewable natural gas (RNG) projects that will capture an amount of methane from U.S. farms equivalent to any remaining methane and carbon dioxide emissions from the company's natural gas operations, making Dominion Energy's gas infrastructure business net zero 10 years before the overall company The baseline and 2020 reporting years were updated to reflect the Climate Registry Protocol to remove divestments and add acquisitions."
"In 2020, Domtar's pulp and paper mills reduced total direct (Scope 1) and indirect (Scope 2) greenhouse gas emissions from purchased energy 27% from 2010 levels, achieving our goal of a 15% reduction from 2010 levels by the end of 2020 for a fifth consecutive year."
"When setting the target for the next year, the expected emission amount is calculated with considering  the growth rate and new facilities, and then the target value is set by applying the reduction rate.  Therefore, the target value for the next year may be larger than the base year value.The emission figure for reporting year exceeded the target, but the emission reduction target was achieved for the facilities that were considered when setting the target. In order to achieve a 10% reduction by 2030, the fuel conversion project was carried out in 2020, and solar power facilities are scheduled to be installed in 2022.  There is no specific target yet, but a plan will be established to achieve the target by 2030."

"This target was set as part of DCU's Climate Action Plan. On advice from the Science based targets initiative, DCU aims for an absolute reduction of 4.2% annually on all scopes 1, 2 & 3 across all campuses and operations.. However, compared to our base year of 2018 we well exceeded our target in 2020 with a reduction of 43%. This was largely due to a dramatic fall in construction in DCU but also COVID restrictions had a major impact on the normal operational functioning of the university. However, DCU still targets a 4.2% absolute reduction of emissions in 2021 and 2022."

"We have committed to delivering carbon neutral operations by 2050. Our emissions target covers all Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions. In the future we may consider market-based Scope 2 emissions in addition to/instead of location-based Scope 2 emissions covered in this target. The impact of climate change is widespread across both human populations and natural ecosystems. Addressing climate change, and the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions that contribute to it, requires urgent action and long-term commitments by every segment of society. With this commitment, we will act to drive down our GHG emissions at a pace that is aligned with climate science. We will procure our electricity from more renewable sources, ramp up our work on energy efficiency projects that deliver the most value and advocate for consistent, predictable policy and regulatory environments that foster innovation, investment and economic growth.We have committed to delivering carbon neutral operations by 2050. Our carbon neutrality ambitions align with international efforts to keep global temperature rise for this century at 1.5 degrees Celsius."
COVID -19 impacted production run rate and therefore emissions . 2021 data will  be necessary to validate progress.

We hit our target in 2020 and will revise and elevate our target for the upcoming year to align with our partner's 2030 goals
This target coverage consists of DXC's emission target covering Scopes 1 and 2 (location-based) Scope 3 (upstream). We have achieved this target two years early and are looking to commit to science-based targets in the next two years.
"This target covers all company operations and emissions. We are continuously adding new scopes to our footprint and our business is growing. These two factors have led to an increase in emissions in the first year since this target was set. Whilst this is the case, we are working to reduce our emissions and achieve the target date by April 2023. We are planning to set science based targets in the next year."
"Compared with the base year, the target emission reduction has been achieved by 25%. However, due to the increase of production capacity, infrastructure and total energy consumption increased in 2016, but unit energy consumption decreased by 25% compared with the base year."
"Ecological Management of Operations Target: scope 1 + 2 and scope 3 (e.g. business trips, water, post, events, home office); and climate neutrality until 2045."
"In 2020, E.ON has set new climate targets in line with the 1.5°C target of the Paris Agreement. New climate targets were necessitated due to the far reaching asset swap with RWE. The targets are as follows: We will reduce our Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 75% by 2030 and by 100% by 2040. We aim to reduce our Scope 3 emissions by 50% by 2030 and by 100% by 2050. They are introduced in the 2020 Sustainability Report (p. 50 ff.).The calculation methods for the E.ON carbon footprint were harmonised in 2020 due to the innogy takeover. innogy's GHG emissions for 2019 were recalculated using the E.ON's methods and emission factors and then aggregated with E.ON's figures. This yielded a consistent baseline calculation. The calculation of our emission reduction targets is based on the core policy scenario EUCO30. Moreover, we assume an improvement of energy efficiency and gas pipelines leading to a reduction on Scope 1 emissions by 1% annually and a 1% reduction of transmission and distribution losses of Scope 2 emissions.   In 2018 we underscored our commitment to reduce the carbon footprint of our own operations by setting the target of making all E.ON buildings carbon-neutral by 2030. In 2020 we formed a project group tasked with designing a roadmap that consists of detailed measures to reduce our buildings' carbon footprint and to foster sustainable property management. Each E.ON unit has the authority to pursue more ambitious emission-reduction targets that go beyond the targets for E.ON as a whole.Our Scope 1 + 2 emissions totalled at 8,051,870 m. t CO2e in 2020. This is a decline compared to 2019 that can mainly be related to a shift from natural gas to biogas in power and heat generation as well as a reduction in fugitive emissions. Also, we account for emissions from generation assets leased to customers in Scope 3.Having updated the climate targets after the innogy takeover, 2019 marks the starting point of measures and initiatives that will help us achieve our new climate targets. However, year-on-year comparisons can be affected by fluctuations due to weather effects or unforeseeable events like Covid-19. A period of several years is needed to determine whether our measures are effective and where we stand with regard to our targets. We will assess the trend every three years. Our first assessment will be at year end 2021."

"1. In 2021, E.SUN committed to set 1.5°C aligned SBT and net zero in 2050. So we set a new target of scope 1+2 in carbon emission in 2021. The target is calculated by SBT methodology and is in line with our 2050 net zero target. 2.The target is to reduce 42% of the scope 1+2 absolute emission in 10 years, which translates to 4.2% reduction per year. Therefore, in 2020, the expected reduction of the intensity is 4.2%. Given the actual reduction of 3.87%, E.SUN now is underway of the schedule."

"In 2020, Eastman announced a goal of reducing its combined absolute Scope 1+2 GHG emissions by one-third by 2030, from a baseline year of 2017.The boundary of Eastman's Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions are manufacturing sites where we have a controlling interest.  Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions have decreased by 5.8% compared to 2019 and have decreased by 17.3% compared the baseline year of 2017."
"In 2019, we developed carbon reduction targets consistent with the challenge presented to corporations by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the United Nations body for assessing the science related to climate change. The group recently declared a climate emergency and issued an urgent request to companies around the world to limit global warming to 1.5o C. Those targets were submitted to the Science Based Target Initiative and approved."
"Our scope 3 science-based target is in line with a 2-degree scenario pathway. Our proposed scope 3 emissions reduction target of 15% absolute reduction by 2030, addresses 100% of Eaton's scope 3 emissions. We used the SBTi Tool to calculate this target.  Progress toward our scope 3 SBT will be measured using our annual GHG inventory calculations for all relevant Scope 3 category emissions and reported in our annual sustainability report and CDP disclosure.  We have re-stated and re-verified our 2018 Scope 3 baseline to reflect improvements in our calculation methodology for categories 1 and 2.  While technically we have exceeded our target, we expect that some of this decline is temporary due to pandemic related production levels, thus we have marked this as ""underway"" above."
"Japan's NDC has set a goal of reducing GHG emissions by 26% by 2030 compared to 2013 levels. The EBARA Group has followed suit and adopted a policy of reducing CO2 emissions by 26% in 2030. Based on the energy composition ratio announced by the Japanese government and the assumed CO2 intensity of electricity in 2030, we set the following reduction scenario.The actual emission in 2018 was 116,601t-CO2, and this value is used as the base value. The target reduction value is a 26% reduction from this base value.If a straight line is drawn between the base value and the target value, the emission target for 2020 is calculated to be 111548 t-CO2, and the actual emission in 2020 was 110537 t-CO2, so the target for this fiscal year was achieved."
"In the 108 years since the founding of the EBARA Group, we have contributed to solving social problems by taking advantage of our technological capabilities and reliability, based on the spirit of ""Enthusiasm and Sincerity"". Looking ahead at human society and the global environment over the next 100 years, we should pay particular attention to extreme weather events and the intensification of natural disasters due to worsening global warming, storm surges due to rising sea levels, inundation of land, and the emergence of problems such as food and water resource depletion. In order to continue to grow in this difficult business environment, we believe that it is essential for us to envision where we want to be in the future, and to clarify our policies and strategies for achieving this goal, which is why we have formulated our long-term vision, E-Vision 2030.In E-Vision 2030, we set numerical values of social and environmental values as the ideal image of EBARA ten years from now.As one of these values, we have set a target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to about 100 million tons of CO2. This target includes Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3, which correspond to the expected sales in 2030, as well as the amount of greenhouse gas emissions from products that can be controlled.Example.Amount of electricity reduction by improving the efficiency of pumps, motors, etc., based on the product development plan for each business, converted to CO2 equivalentWe decompose and treat PFCs gas by using our flue gas treatment system. The target value includes the amount of CO2 equivalent that would be emitted if the PFCs gas were not treated. At present, we do not calculate the amount of reduction in PFCs gas that can be achieved by the use of our flue gas treatment system.Therefore, this question, ""Applicable emissions in the base year,"" includes the total 2019 Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions for the Group. And in the question ""Emissions covered by the base year as a percentage (%) of the total base year emissions of the selected scope (or scope 3 category),"" the denominator is the sum of 2019 Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 and the numerator is the sum of 2019 Scope 1 and Scope 2. We used those numerator and denominator values to calculate."
"eBay's carbon emissions reduction target is applicable for all eBay's owned and leased facilities where eBay currently has procurement control. Procurement control is defined as those sites where eBay receives invoices and pays for energy. 2016 is the base year for this target.The Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions reduction goal was developed using science-based target setting best practices and is in line with emissions trajectories that keep global warming within 1.5 degrees Celsius based on the IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5?C.In 2020, we've reduced our Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 44% from our 2016 baseline, making significant progress toward our goal. This is primarily due to the increase in our renewable energy supply and secondarily due to reduced energy usage across our offices due to COVID-19 as our employees transitioned to remote work."

"In 2019, Ecolab announced that as part of our commitment to the U.N. Global Compact's Business Ambition for 1.5?C, we will work to reduce our carbon emissions by half by 2030. In 2020, our science-based target, with a 2018 baseline was approved by SBTi and announced publicly. We are ahead of progress on this target, having reduced our emissions by 30.5% from our base year. Please note that our base year emissions have been revised to reflect the divestiture of our upstream energy business, completed in 2020. As part of our 1.5C SBT we have committed to work with suppliers representing 70% of Scope 3 emissions to set science-based targets by 2024."
"In 2020, Ecopetrol began the process of updating its medium and long-term emission reduction goals. As a result, in March 2021, the company announced its commitment to reduce its emissions by 25% compared to what was emitted in 2019 and achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 (scopes 1 and 2). Additionally, Ecopetrol seeks to reduce 50% of its total emissions by 2050 (scopes 1, 2 and 3).The established goals cover all the emissions (scope 1, 2 and 3) generated by the Ecopetrol group, which were estimated for 2019 at 13.5 MtCO2e, 2 million additional to those emitted in the same year their in direct operation of Ecopetrol (11.5 MtCO2e). This additional estimate is being reviewed for each of the subsidiaries and for the assets not directly operated by the company, in terms of standardization of calculation methodologies and incorporation of the emissions of the entire group in a single information management tool, in order to be able to report the total emissions for the Ecopetrol group as of 2024.Annually, the company establishes an annual goal that takes into account the contribution of specific projects in different segments of the company. In 2020, the goal reached with the new projects implemented was 199,847 tons of CO2e (tCO2e), exceeding the original goal of 113,265 tCO2e. The total accumulated reduction during the 2010-2020 period is 8,472,766 tCO2e. In 2020 Ecopetrol verified 687,769 tCO2e through Ruby Canyon Engineering, added to the 1,068,394 verified in 2019. In total Ecopetrol has verified 1,756,163 tCO2e.Direct emissions (scope 1) for 2020 were 10,212,462 tCO2e. Compared to projected emissions, this represented a decrease of 1,257,249 tCO2e, derived mainly from the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic.Indirect emissions (scope 2) for 2020 were 760,508 tCO2e. Compared to projected emissions, this represented a decrease of 102,804 tCO2e, derived mainly from the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic."
"In 2019, we committed to reducing absolute Scope 1 + Scope 2 (market-based) emissions by 40 percent by 2025 against a 2018 baseline. We will achieve this through energy efficiency in our operations, and renewable energy commitments."
"In 2020, Ecorodovias's goal was to reduce 0.5% of its Scope 1 + Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions in all its operations. We achieved the  goal due to some energy efficiency initiatives, home office implementation and reduction in the number of business travels. The Covid 19 Pandemic also influenced our numbers, mainly in Scope 2 because we implemented the home office policy for all employees that do not need to be  in person in ours offices and operational bases. This caused one reduction of the energy consumption."
"In 2020 we recalculate the base year to make the comparation more realistic, because in 2015, the scope of Ecorodovias' emissions did not include Land Use, Land Use Change and Forests (LULUCF) emissions. That year, in accordance with the GHG Protocol standards, accounting for emissions in this category was not mandatory in Brazil. Thus, when considering this target, the company did not include LULUCF emissions. In 2020 we included this category of Scope 1 in our emissions of 2015 and our emissions changed from 9,381.31 to 18,938.46.So, with this new calculation of the base year, we achieved the target established. We reduced our GHG emissions of Scope 1 and 2 in 30.47% ( [(13,167.48-18,938.46) / 18,938.46] = 30.47%The main reason for this reduction was the change of fossil fuels in stationary and mobile combustion for renewable sources."
"During 2020 our new sustainability vision was created including proposal of science based targets based on our 2019 baseline.However, due to the closure  of one of our international trucking entities in 2020 our scope 1 emissions declined with 51% resulting in currently achieving our set target.  As the strategy of the company is to increase certain trucking entities, scope 1 fluctuations could occur."
"We have set a company-wide (i.e. Group) absolute reduction target for Scope 1. As it corresponds to the use of fuels and natural gas which are not directly part of the production process, we do not apply intensity indicators. In this case, these sources are used for our facilities, e.g. heating purpose. The target is underway thanks to the energy-efficient projects in each plant, such as HVAC equipment, replacement of heating pumps and automatic controls of heating pumps. Our ambition to reduce our absolute consumption of natural gas and fuels is accompanied by a transition to a low-carbon model. This goal is described in ""Other climate-related goals"" further in this section. It goes hand-in-hand with the reported absolute target to not only minimize our energy consumption, but also ensure renewable sources for all energy types across all locations by 2030.Within our global target of 30% reduction by the end of the year 2023, we have reached a 28% reduction in 2020, therefore we are well on the way to reach our target."

"By 2030, reduce GHG emissions by 10%, based on a FY19 baseline to support the shift to a low carbon economy. Also have a complementary 2030 target to reduce energy use by 10%, based on a FY19 baseline and use 100% renewable electricity across our global operations."
"The target officially approved by SBTi in 2020 is on Scope 1 and 2 emissions intensity. This absolute target is the expression of the emissions intensity target, but expressed in absolute terms, assuming average hydro and wind conditions. This target was updated from a previous target approved in 2019, which was aligned with well below 2ºC trajectory.Group-wide reduction target for combined scope 1 and scope 2 emissions, for all GHGs, was set using the Sectoral Decarbonization Approach - Power Sector of the SBTi. Applies to all geographies and is fully aligned with our public commitment to reduced specific CO2 emissions from electricity generation by 90% in 2030, compared with 2015 levels. This goal was part of EDP's Strategic Update 2019-2022. In early 2021, EDP released its Strategic Update 2021-2025 with even more ambitious goals: 100% renewable installed capacity and electricity generation by 2030 and to reach carbon neutrality in 2030 (scope 1 and 2). As a consequence, EDP submitted to the SBTi a target ambition update (-98% vs. 2015 levels).Target achievement is supported by the strategic focus on renewable generation growth (scope 1 emissions reduction), phase-out of the coal -fired power plants before 2025 and CCGT before 2030, and continued investment in distribution grids, thus reducing electricity losses (scope 2 emissions reduction)."
"Absolute target officially approved by SBTi. Group-wide reduction target for the company's relevant upstream and downstream scope 3 emissions categories: C1 (purchased goods and services); C2 (capital goods), C3 (fuel and energy related activities); C4 (upstream transportation and distribution); C6 (business travel) and C11 (use of sold products). Together, these categories represented 99,6% of total scope 3 emissions in base year.  Target achievement is supported by the reduction of the Group's activities in the coal and gas sectors and by supplier engagement activities focused on supply chain indirect emissions reduction.In early 2021, EDP released its Strategic Update 2021-2025 with even more ambitious goals: 100% renewable installed capacity and electricity generation by 2030 and to reach carbon neutrality in 2030 (scope 1 and 2). As a consequence, EDP submitted to the SBTi a target ambition update on scope 3 (-50% vs. 2015 level)."
"Essa meta está associada a redução de 10% das emissões das emissões de Escopo 1, sendo que 99,9% das emissões estão associadas a combustão estacionária da UTE de Pecém. O ano de 2017 foi selecionado como ano base para medir os esforços ganhos de eficiência, pois a partir de 2018 a unidade implementou projetos de eficiência energética na UTE de Pecém."
"Essa meta engloba dois esforços: (1) redução nas perdas na distribuição (das unidades EDP Espirito Santo e EDP São Paulo) e (2) a redução do consumo de energia elétrica nos edifícios administrativos de todas unidades. As emissões advindas das perdas correspondem mais de 95% das emissões de Escopo 2, dessa forma os principais esforços para redução estão voltados para melhoria da eficiência na distribuição. Existe uma meta de perdas projetada para ano de 2030, que está inclusa na presente meta, porém há também uma revisão na meta de percentual de perdas para cada uma das distribuidoras todos anos para compor uma meta anual que visa a remuneração variável por eficiência (MCP). Para os edifícios administrativos, também está prevista a neutralização das emissões de GEE através da compra de créditos de carbono até 2022 como meta do Grupo EDP Global."

"This target is a new target which we have set in 2019 to be in line with the well-below 2 degrees scenario of SBTi. The target is not yet approved by Science Based Targets Initiative, however, it is in line with the well-below 2 degrees scenario, as it reduces approximately 2.5% per year. Target covers all our Scope 1&2 GHG emissions.Although this target seems to be achieved, we will keep monitoring this target until 2028, because 2020 was an extraordinary year due to Covid-19 related restrictions. Our emission figures have dropped due to these restrictions. Our production figure has also dropped 25.86% when compared to the base year (2018)"

"No relevant exclusions, only reserve power fuels are excluded from the target (this has minor influence on emissions).Percentage in Scope 1 + Scope 2 =  95% Reference 2016: 13,142 tCO2e. Target 2025= 6 572 tCO2e, Achievement 2020: 2,328 tCO2e (down from 4,806 tCO2e in 2019).  End user services like video streaming and mobile gaming are increasing. In addition, new types of IoT solutions demand higher data usage with low latency, i.e. require 5G technology. The main driver for growing energy consumption in Elisa's operations the coming 5 years will be this growing data transfer demand. It is estimated that total network energy consumption will increase 150 to 170 percent by 2026. It is evident that our telecom business operations correlate strongly with electricity consumption.5G is strategic focus areas for Elisa, and it is also more energy efficient per data transferred than older generations of mobile technology. The trend of growing mobile data consumption will require us to continue investments in energy efficiency and optimisation of our networks, to ensure the achievement of our SBTi goal for 2025."

"In 2017, Emira set its Science Based Target of committing to reduce absolute scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions 13% by 2022 from a 2015 base-year. This target was originally set using the SDA methodology, based on a 2-degree warming scenario, using a 2015 base year and a total projected growth rate (in square meters) of 10% during the period.  The base year emissions were consolidated using an Equity-Share based approach. The approach incorporates all of Emira owned asset emissions in scope 1 and scope 2, even if these emissions are controlled by Emira tenants or are part of an investment in a global property portfolio over which Emira has no control.  During the current reporting period, Emira analysed and reported on Corporate emissions as per the Financial-Control consolidation approach. This was done to align with global best practice and Emira's own integrated reporting where investments are treated as ""indirect"" assets.   As per this new approach all assets under the financial control of Emira are included as scope 1 and 2 emissions, including the tenant portion of asset  usage. However, investments in global asset funds are treated as scope 3 emissions.  Emira is currently in the process of resubmitting  a more ambitious 1.5DS target under the SBTi.  In doing so, the new target will be re-stated as per the financial control approach.  However, for the purpose of current target tracking and this CDP response, the equity based approach is used, and therefore covered emissions reported here are not aligned to the total scope 1 and 2 emissions reported in the rest of this CDP questionnaire.   In 2019, the  target was recalculated to take into account all acquisitions and divestment's, in line with the recalculation policy of Emira. The Base year emissions were thus restated from 217127 tonnes  to 172970 tonnes CO2e. The total covered emissions include total scope 1 and 2 emissions and total scope 3 investment emissions for all properties, and equate to 164,473. The absolute target at 2023 is 13% of 172970 or 150484 tonnes CO2e.  So, Emira has achieved 37.8% of the target."
"We had set the vision to reduce our emissions (Scope 1 & Scope 2) to 0 by 2050. Hence, we set the 2020 GHG reduction goals respectively. i.e. -25% of absolute GHG emissions from 2014 to 2020, which we achieved. We consider the goal as SBTi conform since it is the same reduction path as the one used for our SBTI-validated goals (Abs 2).To continue the Net 0 path, we set further GHG reduction goals for Scope 1&2. Considering our old 2014 baseline, the target is to reduce absolute emissions by 60% until 2027.  For SBTi, we updated the caclulation towards a 2019 baseline. We added the Scope 1+2 target submitted to SBTi (and validated) as stated in Abs 2 below.Target coverage:We apply the operational control aproach: Emmi has several minority holdings over which the company does not have substantial operational control. Operational control is needed to implement reduction measures. With the operational control approach the relevant emission sources are included.Facilities excluded: We excluded facilities that Emmi has acquired within the last two years. This is along the Group's strategy of integrating new acquisitions step by step, and considers the time required to receive high-quality KPIs from new acquisitions.  We had to exclude the site Seymour of Emmi Roth due to a lack of data.                         Activities excluded:  We excluded the activities of global trade business (retail business of goods produced by others), because i) its emissions are rather irrelevant compared to emissions from milk production, ii) it would require significant and complex data gathering, and iii) it accounts for a minor share of revenue (<7%)."
"For our new target period 2021-2027 we continue the Net zero 2050 path, and submitted these targets to SBTi in December 2020, received validation in March 2021.SBTi response: Targets cover all scope 1 & 2 emissions in the company's GHG inventory, developed in line with the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard. Targets for scope 1 and 2 cover 98% of the company's scope 1 and 2 emissions. The GHG inventory and scope 1 and 2 target covers all relevant GHGs. The company reported direct carbon emissions from combustion of biofuels and/or biomass. The relevant emissions are included in the scope 1 and 2 target boundary. The company included all relevant subsidiary emissions in GHG inventory and target boundary.  The scope 1 and 2 target year is seven years from the date of target submission.. The required reduction between the most recent year that a GHG inventory is available and the scope 1 and 2 target year is sufficiently ambitious, to be consistent with the level of decarbonization required to keep global temperature increase to 1.5 C compared to pre industrial temperatures. The target has been assessed against the absolute contraction approach endorsed by the SBTi.Please note: 1) The scope of this goal  is different than the scope of Abs1, since the  production sites in Brazil (LPA) are included, which were acquired end of 2019 due to the significant volume of milk processed by them (322'724'401.00 kg in 2019) and corresponding energy consumption / emissions.  The Scope for Abs 1 does not include LPA data. Hence, the GHG emissions for 2020 are different in Abs and Abs 2. LPA's Scope 1 emissions are 4'568 t CO2eq in 2019, mostly caused by the diesel for the generator, while they cover most of their heat demand by wood . LP's S2 emissions are 2'699 t CO2eq in 2019.2) Change of S2 methodology: We switched from a location-based to a market-based approach of reporting Scope 2 emissions, supported by Quantis in the process of establishing the 2019 GHG baseline for SBTi submission. Also, we split emissions from electricity from only S2 (as previously done) to Scope 2 and Scope 3 (Cat.3). We will report with the 2019 base year in the future i.e. also for  next CDP Reporting. For this CDP Reporting, we focus on our ""old"" methodology, since the tagret period is closed with end of 2020."

"On september 2019 CMPC publicly established it's tangible commitments towards sustainable development, related to emissions reductions, waste disposal, conservation and water use. About the emission reduction target, CMPC set a company-wide target to reduce by 50% all it's scope 1+2 emissions by 2030, considering 2018 as baseline, including all  it's facilities where it has operational control in the 8 countries in Latin America where we operate. This emission reduction target was estimated using the SBTi-tool by an absolute contraction approach and considering the 1.5°C scenario, so we consider it a science-based reduction initiative.  We have not yet submitted our target to the SBTi because we are still setting our scope 3 emission reduction target, but we plan to pledge in the next 2 years. It is important to mention that the target covers all of CMPC's operations so recalculation of the baseline was made during 2020, as recommended by best practices, because during 2020 CMPC acquired 2 new facilities, one in Brazil (Sepac) and one in Peru (Panam) which are now incorporated in the goal. With this goal, CMPC is contributing to target 13.3 of the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) ''Climate Action”, which dictates: ''Improve education, awareness-raising and human and institutional capacity on climate change mitigation, adaptation, impact reduction and early warning”."
"In 2019, Enagás approved an ambitious Decarbonisation Strategy, setting the following absolute targets (s1+s2) compared to 2018, which Enagás will achieve through the specific measures outlined in its Energy Efficiency and Emissions Reduction Plan.• Short-term: cutting s1+s2 emissions by an average of 5% for 2019-2021. (Referred as ''Abs1”).• Medium-term: reduce by 15% and 41% our s1+s2 emissions in 2025 and 2030, respectively.  (Referred as ''Abs2” and ''Abs 3”).• Long-term: reduce by 65% our s1+s2 emissions in 2040 (Referred as ''Abs4”) and become carbon neutral the same year by offsetting remaining GHG emissions.Targets ''Abs3” and ''Abs4” were revised in 2020 to raise the level of ambition of the ones included in our 2020 CDP response - reference ""Abs3"" and ''Abs4”.In 2020, Enagás also set new annual emission reduction targets (short term):- Reduce 10.7% s1 emissions in 2020 vs 2019 (referred as ''Abs 5”).- Reduce 10.7% s2 emissions in 2020 vs 2019 (referred as ''Abs 6”).Targets have been established taking into consideration international initiatives such as We Mean Business, SBTi, Global Methane Alliance, Methane Guiding Principles and OGMP.''Abs 1” is a target included in the Long-term Incentive Plan, linked to the variable remuneration of all employees. Its achievement will be monitored until 2021. In 2020 Enagás reduced its s1+s2 emissions by 32% compared to 2019 (-31% vs 2018), a percentage significantly higher than the decrease in demand for natural gas, which fell by almost 10%. This reduction was made possible by the implementation of energy efficiency and emissions reduction measures. However, the achievement of target ""Abs 1"" will depend on GHG emissions generated in 2021.It is important to notice that ""% of target achieved"" is an auto-calculated field in the ORS system, however given that target relates to an average emission reduction over a 3 year period, assessment should be conducted at target year (2021). Nevertheless, the 2 year average emission reduction (2019-2020) trend shows real progress toward the target, an average emission reduction of 15% have been achieved for 2019-2020 compared to 2018.Coverage:The target covers 100% of base year (2018) and reporting year (2020) s1+s2 emissions, including 100% of operations in which Enagás has management control at the time target establishment.

"The Scope 3 category ""Use of Sold Products"" has been considered following 2 approaches:1. Enagás' internal methodology, which covers the emissions directly related to our activity and is verified in accordance with standard UNE-EN ISO 14064 as part of the Enagás Carbon Footprint verification process.2. Natural gas value-chain based approach. It has been developed to give answer to CDP requirements and concerns of various interest groups, as well as in an effort of awareness and transparency.Following the first approach, this category has been considered not applicable to Enagás as our activity is limited to the transportation of natural gas, classified within the midstream segment. Enagás is not the owner of the gas at any stage of the value chain and therefore does not sell gas or any other product and it is not responsible for emissions related to the use of the products, the final end life of the product or its processing. This product sales activity corresponds to companies belonging to the distribution segment (downstream). Hence this category has been considered not relevant by the external auditor and has not been included in question C10.1c.Based on the second approach, we have calculated the value for this category by considering the emissions (scope 1 and 2) from the distribution companies we supply the gas to. Distribution companies in Spain are our most immediate downstream connection in the natural gas supply chain. Target ""Abs 7"" aims for an 18.6% reduction in the mean value for these emissions during the period 2013-2030 against the emissions from 2018 (base year). The percentage of target achieved in 2020 is higher than 100%, which indicates a good evolution of the target. Nevertheless, it must be noted that the accomplishment of the target in the years prior to 2030 does not assure its fulfillment in the target year.Coverage:The target covers the emissions from the main gas distributor in Spain since their accumulated emissions for the period 2018-2020 account for 80% of the emissions from all the distribution companies considered. This company is also the only one for which there is public information regarding their emission reduction targets."
"A central goal of our 25-point sustainability program is to achieve climate neutrality. As an integrated energy company with its own comprehensive generation portfolio, we can make an important contribution to safeguarding the livelihoods of future generations. We have thus set ourselves the ambitious aim of achieving climate neutrality by 2035 across the entire company with respect to our own emissions (Scope 1 and 2). Our Scope 3 emissions are mainly due to the gas consumption by our customers. We anticipate that it will only be possible to reduce Scope 3 emissions by switching to climate-neutral gases, which will probably not be available in sufficient quantities until the middle of the 2030s. An important milestone in our climate neutrality strategy will be halving our CO2 emissions by 2030, based on the reference year of 2018. To this end, we will reduce our coal-based generation capacity of 4.6 GW (reference year of 2018) by around 2.5 GW. In parallel, we will examine the possibility of a fuel switch from coal to more climate-friendly gas and then in a second stage to climate neutral gases such as biogas or hydrogen."

"Endesa, as part of the Enel Group, aims to decarbonize its energy generation mix before 2050. This objective was verified by Science Based Targets Initiative's (SBTI) official target quality-check on 4th December 2015, and was then reviewed and revalidated in 2019 to align to the new ambitions required by the SBTi (WB2C pathway), and in 2020 to align with 1.5C pathway. The strategy supporting the achievement of this ambitious objective includes the following key aspects: • Transition from fossil fuels to clean sources; • Promotion of efficiency measures in existing assets; • Increase the electrification and digitalization of society (electric vehicle, smart grids projects, promotion of sustainable cities, etc.)Regarding decarbonisation, up to 2020 the company has increased the percentage of free emissions energy generated and increased its installed capacity of renewable energies, leading to a reduction of absolute CO2 emissions of 70.4% since 2017."

"The Enel Group aims to fully decarbonize its energy generation mix by 2050. This objective was verified by Science Based Targets Initiative's (SBTI) official target quality-check on 4th December 2015. The target was revised in September 2019, changing the base year to 2017, but the target remains intact. The Group strategy for the period 2021-2023 works towards this target, envisaging additional capacity from renewable sources of 19.5 GW (including managed capacity), which will consequently make an increase in emission-free production to 65% by 2023 and nearly to 80% by 2030."
"In September 2019, Enel set an additional target, also certified by the Science Based Target initiative (SBTi), to reduce indirect emissions associated with the consumption of gas by Enel's end-user customers (indirect emissions from the use of products sold), which represent a significant source of indirect Scope 3 emissions. The targeted reduction is of 16% of the base year (2017) by 2030. In order to achieve such target, Enel works towards the promotion of the customer passage from gas to electricity (especially residential customers) and in the optimization of the customer's gas portfolio (especially industrial and residential customers)."
"We will pursue cheaper renewable energy, CO2-free hydrogen, CCS and CCUS through technological innovation, and pursue EV and other aspects of the mobility business. We will also promote energy conservation through the introduction of automated operations at our refineries and smelters.Through these initiatives, we aim to achieve carbon neutrality by reducing our own emissions by the equivalent of 17 million tons by 2040.Specifically, one-third of the reduction will come from existing energy conservation initiatives at our refineries and plants, promotion of environmentally friendly products, CCUS, etc., one-third from the pursuit of renewable energy, and one-third from   technological innovations such as e-fuel and the pursuit of new emerging businesses."
"We will reduce customer CO2 emissions by 1.8 million tons through the sale and development of environmentally-friendly products such as lubricants that improve fuel efficiency, ETBE-blend gasoline, hydrogen and renewable energy."
"We aim to reduce CO2 emissions by 10.17 million tons in FY2030,  compared to FY2009, by pursuing energy conservation measures in business activities and pursuing sales and development of environmentally friendly products, including renewable energy, while also pursuing environmentally conscious businesses and contributing to the development of a low-carbon, recycling-oriented society."
"Energean obtained guarantees of origin for the total amount of electricity purchased by the Greek Power Public Corporation (PPC) in 2020 and will continue to do so also in 2021. Thus, electricity consumed in Greece, which represented the biggest amount of electricity consumed by Energean, was generated by renewable sources. A total amount of 31542 tCO2 emission were avoided by acquiring renewable energy from the grid, which accounts for the 37% of the total Scope 1&2 emissions of the country. Going forward and expecting total emissions to be increased, Energean plans to develop a low carbon blue-hydrogen unit coupled with a CCS site initially in Prinos Greece and further replicate this to Egypt and Italy. These developments will provide the required energy for our plants and also be used to store carbon emissions captured elsewhere. Further to that a process modification project in Prinos Greece for re-injecting all produced sour gas instead of treating it to sulfur is under assessment. We consider all above planned developments to be science-based targets, but they are not approved by the SBTi since the Oil & Gas sector's reduction pathway is not yet issued for use by the SBTi."
"1. A Prime Mover fleet replacement strategy to Euro-6 Emission standards with the first two Euro-6 prime movers operational by September 2021.  2. AIR CTI tyre pressure management systems are installed on the fleet to improve tyre wear and tear by 30%. Correct tyre pressure matched to the road surface reduces rolling resistance and improves fuel economy.  Reduced tyre pressure on rough surfaces increases tyre life span and other truck components by absorbing shocks and impacts. This assists with the reduction of other particulate emissions not currently being considered in our industry.3. We have a partnership with CMV Truck centre to reduce transport emissions by 25% by utilizing custom built PBS assets to increase productivity and lower the number of trucks on the road. This includes working with Aero dynamics, Euro-6 engines and Cummins GPS engine mapping programs for elevation and road gradients to capitalise on vehicle momentum and coast opportunities to reduce RPM and decrease fuel burn.ELX's future carbon reduction initiatives include:a) Acquisition of a 6 Tonne hybrid parcel Truck to reduce local PUD emissions by 25%b) Haulage optimisation including PBS combinations as the freight profile and access road network allows it.c)  Long term Fleet replacement program (when fleet requires replacement) of Euro 6 engines in Prime Movers"

"The Group is committed to achieving Net Zero Carbon by  2045 for all its emissions scopes. Net Zero Carbon will be  reached by means of a well-below 2°C trajectory target to 2030, which the  SBT initiative will be asked to certify. The Group is involved  in the Business ambition 1.5°C coalition which is part of the  COP 26 Race to Zero campaign. ENGIE will only invest in  projects and regions consistent with its long-term goal of  reducing its GHG emissions. This will, in particular, result in  the inclusion of fugitive emissions from gas networks, all  emissions from purchases, and emissions from the Group's  working methods. The Group will continue to allocate carbon budgets to each  of its activities and to take carbon pricing into account in all  its short-, medium- and long-term investment decisions.This trajectory relies on interim targets for the two highest contributing categories: GHG emissions from energy  production and GHG emissions from the use of sold products described in Abs 2 and Abs 3, respectively"
"ENGIE submitted at the end of 2019 a request for certification of its CO2 eq emissions to the +2°C commitments of the Paris Agreement. ENGIE's first decarbonization targets were certified by the SBTI (Science Based  Targets initiative) in February 2020, making the Group one of the first multi-energy  companies to receive this certification. These targets are a reduction between 2017 and 2030 of:• 52% in the rate of emissions per kWh from the Group's energy production • 34% in emissions related to the Group's use of products sold.These two greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets concern more than 90% of the  Group's 2017 emissions. They demonstrate ENGIE's commitment to respecting the Paris Agreement and constitute a step towards the Group's Net Zero Carbon. The Group is working on new and even more ambitious decarbonization  targets with a view to well-below 2°C certification. Abs 2 target corresponds to the first ENGIE target which has been certified by the SBT initiative (reduction  by 52% the rate of emissions per kWh of energy production between 2017 and 2030). It covers ENGIE energy production from entities controlled by ENGIE (scope 1) and consolidated in equity (scope 3) by ENGIE. ENGIE's reduction activities in meeting the Scope 1 targets will result in lower emission factors in countries where it operates and  consumed electricity and heat, and thereby reduce our scope 2 emissions mechanically .The target is mainly based on the planned withdrawal from coal by 2025 in Europe and by 2027 in the rest of the world. The Group presented its plan to withdraw from coal by  2027. To deliver on this plan, ENGIE will first prioritize the  closure of these sites, then their conversion to low-carbon  energy, and will lastly disposed of them, if it is impossible to  close or convert them due to local restrictions. The Group is  committed to disclosing these exit strategies on a basis in an effort to lead a just transition."
"Mindful of its environmental responsibility and in line with its purpose to contribute to the decarbonation of the economy, ENGIE submitted at the end of 2019 a request for certification of its CO2 eq emissions to the +2°C commitments of the Paris Agreement. It obtained this certification in February 2020. For this, the Group is engaged on two points:• reduce the carbon intensity of its electricity production (scopes 1 and 3) by 52% by 2030 compared to 2017;• reduce emissions from the use of products sold (scope 3) by 34% by 2030 compared to 2017.This certification demonstrates ENGIE's aim of becoming a major player in the energy transition to a carbon neutral world.Abs 3 target is the second ENGIE target certified by SBT initiative and  covers the used of sold products (scope 3)."

Target Abs 3 reported last year (-30% by 2035) has therefore been reported here as ""revised"".The target is based on a distinctive methodology for the evaluation of all GHG emissions related to Eni's energy products along the value chain. The indicator used for this target (net GHG lifecycle emissions) is part of the new metrics defined by the methodology, which include Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions, in absolute and relative terms, linked to the energy products sold accounted on an equity basis. This list of products includes oil & gas, electricity and also new bio products originating from the circular economy business. For each of these products, the methodology envisages the inclusion of all material sources of GHG emissions generated along their value chain, according to a well-to-wheel approach. In 2021, the reporting model was further refined to better represent the actual use of the volumes sold to the market, including non-energy uses (e.g. petrochemicals) or those associated with decarbonized products (e.g. blue hydrogen, power with CCS). Therefore,  2018 base year data has been revised accordingly. The target communicated during Strategy 2021 represents the net absolute emissions reduction by 2030 of 25% at net of carbon sinks. In line with CDP guidance, the reduction reported in this section (-21% by 2030 versus 2018) represents an estimation of the gross emissions reduction, obtained by subtracting the role of CCS and forestry, that respectively have targets in 2030 equal to 7 and 20 MtCO2eq."

The role of these technologies at 2040 has been considered by linear interpolation of CCS and forestry targets communicated for 2030 (7 MtCO2e and 20 MtCO2e respectively) and 2050 (50 MtCO2e and 40 MtCO2e respectively)."
"Goal: Changing all business sites to green energy and climate-neutral natural gas as well as district heating to reduce the CO2e-emissions for energy use in the business. The goal includes rented objects. We are in continual negotiations with the owners of these rental objects. Comment: A reduction of 100% is not realistic for several reasons. Our influence is limited in rented objects. We evaluate our green energy in climate reporting based on the LCA-method (includes scope 3). Our net-zero natural gas must be initially reported based on its CO2e-emissions. Then the associated CO2-compensation certificates are noted separately in climate reporting after the fact. Status 2020: Electricity use in generation plants, energy grids and business sites was 95% green energy. The goal achievement level is approximately 103%.Calculation elements: Emissions from own energy use in 2020: 2,072 metric tons CO2e. This is equivalent to a reduction of 83% compared to the base year. The goal achievement level is approximately 103%.Addendum: Taking the compensations coming along with the use of our net-zero natural gas (1,067 t CO2e) into account, our 2020 emissions reduce from 2,072 t CO2e to 1,005 t CO2e which equals a reduction of 92% compared to the base year respectively a target achievement level of 115%."
"Goal: By 2045 at the latest we aim to achieve climate-neutrality in our company-wide Scope 1 emissions.This includes emissions from the fuel in our power and heat generation plants as well as our company vehicle fleet. In addition, this goal includes our emissions from fuel use in energy generation plants, in which we have an ownership of less than a 50% share. The power plant (Gemeinschaftkraftwerk Irsching, Block 5), of which we maintain a 9% share, didn't generate substantial levels of electricity until October 2020, when it re-entered the electricity market from its position in the grid reserve capacity. This is the key reason for our Scope 1 emissions significantly climbing in 2020 and even more so in 2021. Natural gas-fueled power plants are necessary for the transition to a net-zero energy market - leading to a gradual phasing in of hydrogen-based technologies from 2030 to 2045.In an effort to check the effectiveness of our climate targets, we are utilizing the XDC model from Right. based on science GmbH. With their Scenario Explorer tool we are able to check the conformity of our climate strategy targets and measures towards a well below 2° C pathway."
"Goal: By 2025 at the latest we aim to achieve climate-neutrality in our company-wide Scope 2 emissions.This includes emissions from the grid/network losses in our electricity grid and heating network. In addition some emissions arise from our electricity use in power generation plants, from which we maintain less than a 50% share. Seeing as the grid losses in our electricity grid in 2020 were lower than average due to Corona, we expect our Scope 2 emissions to rise in 2021 or at the latest in 2022.In an effort to check the effectiveness of our climate targets, we are utilizing the XDC model from Right. based on science GmbH. With their Scenario Explorer tool we are able to check the conformity of our climate strategy targets and measures towards a well below 2° C pathway."
"Goal: By 2045 at the latest we aim to achieve climate-neutrality in our company-wide Scope 3 emissions.This includes fuel- and energy-related emissions (including power plants, of which we maintain a share less than 50%), as well as business travel and most significantly the sales of electricity and natural gas to end customers.In an effort to check the effectiveness of our climate targets, we are utilizing the XDC model from Right. based on science GmbH.

"Convert lighting at 9 facilities to LED lighting. Square footage of facility areas to be converted to LED lighting will be:  225,000 square feet in 2017 and 2018,  an additional 21,000 square feet in 2019, and an additional 103,000 square feet in 2020 for a total area conversion of 350,000 square feet by end of 2020.  The LED lighting is projected to reduce Scope 2 CO2e emissions by 350 metric tons."
"Entergy is committed to reducing our environmental footprint. In 2001, Entergy was the first U.S. utility to cap CO2 emissions voluntarily. The commitment was to stabilize emissions at 2000 levels through 2005. After beating that target by over 20 percent, the company renewed and strengthened this commitment twice, while expanding it to include power purchases from which we could reasonably determine a CO2 emission rate. The company's commitment through 2020 was to stabilize CO2 cumulative emissions from company-owned power plants and controllable power purchases at 20 percent below year 2000 levels through 2020 and we outperformed that goal by 8%  (measured based on emissions reduction in all scopes).  In April 2019, Entergy announced it was intensifying efforts even further by setting a new climate goal to reduce our CO2 emission rate to 50% below 2000 levels by 2030. The new goal was set based on the 2019 climate scenario analysis (https://www.entergy.com/userfiles/content/environment/docs/EntergyClimateScenarioAnalysis.pdf) and means that for every unit of electricity we generate in 2030, we will emit half the CO2 we did in 2000.   In 2020, Entergy committed to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. This is outlined in Entergy's 2020 Climate Report Addendum. (https://cdn.entergy.com/userfiles/content/environment/docs/ClimateReportAddendum_2020.pdf)"
"In 2020, Entergy committed to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 for all businesses, all scopes, and all gases. Entergy will continue to transform its generation portfolio to cleaner, low and zero-carbon resources.  This transformation will result in a lower emission rate as conceived by our 2030 climate analysis and goal.  It also will result in reducing absolute emissions as additional low- and zero-carbon generation technologies are integrated into our system over the next three decades.  Regarding Entergy's gas business, local distribution company operations represented only 0.1% of our direct emissions (fugitive losses - scope 1) and 2.4% of our indirect emissions (customer combustion - scope 3) in 2020. These categories are part of our net-zero commitment, and we will work to minimize these emissions through efforts to decarbonize the gas fuel supply, replace older supply piping and partner with customers on energy efficiency and beneficial electrification.  Additionally, we will continue to engage our gas suppliers to reduce upstream emissions. All of these actions will minimize the full lifecycle emissions associated with these operations."
"Scope 1 and 2 emissions in base year and reporting year have been recalculated and will therefore not align to emissions reported in our Annual and Sustainability report 2020. Scope 1 and 2 emissions have been recalculated for CO2e and to include additional facilities to reach 97.5% coverage of the Epiroc Group. As part of our 2030 Sustainability goals, Epiroc has committed to half CO2 emissions in operations in 2030 compared to 2019. An application was sent in to SBTi in June 2021 but it has not yet been approved."
"Emissions from upstream and downstream in base year has been recalculated and will therefore not align to emissions reported in our Annual and Sustainability report 2020. A few entities that were acquired in 2019 and started to report in 2020 have been added in base line year figures. The customer centers have been excluded from the scope since they represent less than 20% of the total emissions from upstream and downstream transport emissions. This absolute target covers production and distribution centers which represent the majority of the carbon emissions. Epiroc has in partnership with a third partner company performed a hybrid approach using both screening and inventory of scope 3 emissions. The result was that that this category represented 2% of total Scope 3 emissions. As part of our 2030 Sustainability goals, Epiroc has committed to half CO2 emissions from transport in 2030 compared to 2019 and therefore this category is considered relevant."
"Epiroc has in partnership with a third partner company performed a hybrid approach using both screening and inventory of scope 3 emissions.

An application was sent in to SBTi in June 2021 but it has not yet been approved.The covered emissions in reporting year has been calculated based on volume change in the different product categories. The majority of the reduction is based on lower sales volumes n 2020 vs. 2019 but some part is related to sales of more energy efficient and electrified products."
"Equinix partnered with an external consultant in 2020 to develop our science-based target (SBT) to reduce Scope 1 and Scope 2 by 50% by 2030 over a 2019 baseline. This 12-year, medium-term target applies to Equinix's global operations. The target setting method applied was Absolute Contraction Approach with a 1.5-degree scenario. As the target was set in late 2020, it is considered as a new target and the percent of target achieved is therefore just 1%. The target has been recently approved by the SBTi at the time of writing this CDP."

"Equinix has a 100% renewable energy goal across our global operations by 2030. This equates to achieving a 100% reduction in Scope 2 market-based emissions originating from electric power over a 2015 base year (766,000 mtCO2e) to net zero in the future. This 16-year, long-term target applies to Equinix's global operations. Within Scope 2, Equinix utilizes 98% electric power and 2% chilled water, thus the percentage of Scope 2 emissions covered by our goal is 98%. Equinix's Scope 2 market-based total for 2020 was 321,279 mtCO2e (or 327,718 with chilled water) representing a 58% reduction or ''58% of target achieved” since the base year of 2015."
"Absolute GHG reductions in Norway - 40% by 2030. Equinor has launched new climate ambitions to reduce the absolute greenhouse gas emissions from its operated offshore fields and onshore plants in Norway by 40% by 2030, 70% by 2040 and to near zero by 2050. These new absolute emission targets replace the relative ""CO2 emission reductions"" target Equinor had previously. By 2030 this implies annual emission reductions of more than 5 million tonnes, corresponding to around 10% of Norway's total CO2 emissions. A 40% reduction by 2030 is planned to be realised through large scale industrial measures, including energy efficiency, digitalisation and the launch of several electrification projects at key fields and plants, including the Troll and Oseberg offshore fields and the Hammerfest LNG plant. The 2030 ambition is expected to require investments of USD 5-6 billion (NOK 50 billion) for Equinor and its partners."

In 2050, Equinor expects Norwegian oil and gas production to be less than half of current levels, assuming development of the defined projects ahead of us, substantial efforts to increase production from existing fields and continued exploration."
"Eliminate routine flaring by 2030. We have set a company-wide upstream flaring intensity target of 0.2% by 2020 for our operated assets. This was set in 2012 as part of our commitment to the Sustainable Energy for All Initiative. Our aim is to eliminate routine flaring in our operations by 2030 at the latest, in line with the World Bank's Zero Routine Flaring by 2030 Initiative. In Norway we do not have routine flaring in our operations. We have been working systematically to reduce flaring on the Norwegian Continental Shelf (NCS) as well and have seen a positive trend. Reductions have been achieved mostly by changing our operating procedures, such as when starting a well, and due to hardware changes, for example the semi closed flare solution implemented at Statfjord C. We are also investigating reductions opportunities from increasing awareness by better monitoring of flare rates, tuning of separator pressure control and increasing the reliability of important rotating machinery.We currently have flaring from the Mariner field due to gas production exceeding the need for power generation in the early production phase. After a few years, the field will use all its associated gas for energy production and flaring will be stopped. We expect Mariner to meet our commitment to the World Bank 2030 zero routine initiative.In 2020 we still had routine flaring from our US Bakken assets due to challenges related to gas infrastructure. Production growth in this area has exceeded the midstream pipeline capacity, resulting in excess gas being sent to flare rather than to sales. During the course of 2020 we agreed the sale of our Bakken assets and we completed divestment of them in April 2021."

"Equitrans began developing this emission reduction target in 2020 and it is reflected in the Company's initial Climate Policy, which was approved by the Board of Directors in December 2020. Our aspiration to reduce our Scope 1 and 2 methane emissions 50% by 2030 was not publicly announced until the January 2021 publication of our Climate Policy. As such, while we were engaged in targeted actions to reduce emissions prior to 2021, the specific actions taken to make progress towards the stated emission reduction goals began in 2021. In 2020, Equitrans created a multi-disciplinary methane reduction committee to evaluate opportunities to reduce methane emissions, calculate the costs to enact these opportunities, and develop a plan to implement the projects to meet the 2030 methane reduction goal. This methane reduction plan, which will be completed in 2021, will outline the steps needed to meet the 2030 goal."

"Equitrans formulated an interim methane goal in 2020, which was reviewed and approved in 2021, to reduce annualized methane emissions from pneumatic devices by 40% in 2021 (excluding MVP and Eureka Midstream Holdings, LLC) as part of the company-wide short-term incentive program. Further information was previously provided in the response to Question C1.3. Pneumatic devices were selected for this goal as they were one of the largest sources of methane emissions during the 2019 baseline year. Assuming achievement in 2021, this reduction will account for an approximately 11% reduction in total methane emissions when compared to 2019."
"Eramet has developed a Science-Based Target that has been approved by SBT and that is compliant with the WB2C scenario (reduction of absolute CO2e emissions Scope 1+2 by 40% from a 2019 base year to a 2035 target year).The main emissions reduction levers are:-the development of CCS in partnership with other players: this is the action with the greatest impact in terms of CO2 savings, but the cost of these solutions is an obstacle. Therefore, the ambition is to develop a pilot and identify the least capital-intensive technologies;-using bio-reducers in ore reduction: the issue of this action is the ability to access sustainably managed bio- reducers compatible with the constraints of our processes ;-replacing heavy fuel oil by gas for the production of electricity-the establishment of renewable electricity purchases and production coupled with the electrification of mines: at the same time as developing technical solutions, the successful implementation of this lever is based on a radical change of culture which requires long-term support;-developing the pre reduction of hydrogen ore alongside bio-reducers.Moreover, three decarbonation scenarios have been built:- absolute potential => all levers have been put at their maximum level of activation without considering any other constraints- technical potential => all levers have been put at their maximum level of activation while taking into account what is technically feasible- actionable potential => all levers have been put at their maximum level of activation while taking into account both technical and economic constraints. this is this later scenario that has been used to build the decarbonation roadmapThis robust roadmap to reduce the carbon footprint of Eramet's activities includes the percentage of activation of the different emissions reduction levers, a timeline (2025, 2030, 2035) and the impact and activation of the levers are at the granularity of the site to be easily actionable and precise.The efforts to reduce the carbon footprint of Eramet will not be the same for each business unit: Eramet will mainly focus on the processes that emit the bulk of Eramet emissions (manganese alloy and nickel alloy).This roadmap has been included in a specific chapter of the annual strategy plan of Eramet.. The SBT roadmap is therefore at the core of Eramet's strategy."
"In 2017 Ericsson set an absolute emission reduction target covering our global company-wide emissions in Scope 1, Scope 2 (market-based) and Scope 3 categories Business travel and Downstream transportation. Ericsson refers to this scope as ""own activities"" - i.e., activities that we have direct influence over. This target has been approved by the Science Based Target initiative. The sum of emissions in scope was 560k tonnes of CO2e in the base year (2016) and Ericsson committed to reducing these  by 35% by 2022. As of year-end 2020 we saw reductions beyond our target value but since business travel emissions are in scope and these reduced drastically in 2020 due to the COVID pandemic, we do not consider this target achieved until the business environment has returned to pre-pandemic conditions. However, even without the effect of the pandemic, and assuming business travel would have remained at the same levels as in 2019, we are still well on track to achieving our target (excluding the reduction in emissions from business travel the total value of emissions in scope would have been approximately 340 ktonne in 2020, which is still well below our 2022 target) as we have achieved substantial Scope 1 and 2 emission reductions since the target was set. Further, Ericsson does not foresee business travel returning to pre-pandemic levels so part of the achieved reduction of emissions in this category are projected to be permanent."
"In March 2020, ESB Group signed and submitted the Science Based Target Commitment Letter to SBTi. In early June 2020, our provisional Target submission form, including the above target, was submitted to SBTi and is currently undergoing a clarifications process and awaiting sectoral guidance  on Scope 3 Category 11.Target Abs3- Scope 1 included - Generation thermal emissions, fugitive emissions (SF6), vehicle fleet emissions, building thermal heating.Scope 2 included - Purchased electricity, Transmission & Distribution system losses (All Island Network, Republic of Ireland & Northern Ireland)Strategic Context of targetLeading the low carbon transition of society is the central tenet of ESB Group's corporate strategy and we see electricity as an enabler of decarbonisation for many other sectors of modern society (such as transport and heating). This puts a significant burden of trust and expectation on ESB Group to set and deliver stretching targets, that support and deliver on the climate science of emissions reduction trajectories, by delivering the decarbonisation of electricity generation at a rate which supports the climate science."
"Target Abs 2 refers to the emissions scope which are tracked as part of ESB Group's annual internal carbon  footprint reporting process, attributable directly to the operation of the business. This excludes emissions from electricity generation and Transmission & Distribution Losses, but includes direct Scope 1 emissions from:- - ESB Group vehicle fleets - natural gas heating- building standby generators- fugitive emissions (SF6, PFC) associated with switchgear insulation and leak detection programmes and Indirect Scope 2 emissions from:-- electricity purchased and consumed on premisesIndirect Scope 3 emissions from:-Business travel by road and air, outsourced datacentre energy usage, emissions related to waste.Progress against the target in the past year is largely attributable to significant operational improvements in the monitoring, managing, leak detection and remediation of emissions associated with SF6 Leakage and the COVID -19 related impacts of reduced business travel and building occupancy. Progress was also made in programmed reductions in energy usage in buildings and fleet, bringing associated emissions reductions in the vehicle fleet and buildings portfolio."
"Eskom's climate change policy is intended to support South Africa to meet its' nationally-determined contribution (for the country's GHG emissions to Peak (by 2025 at between 398 and 614 Mtpa), Plateau (for up to a decade), and Decline (in absolute terms thereafter). This range is considered 2 degree aligned at the bottom end of the range. Eskom previously participated in the DFFE voluntary carbon budget process (2016-2020) and will continue to do so until the expected mandatory company-level carbon budgets are implemented under the proposed Climate Change Bill. Eskom also submitted its 2020 annual progress report for the previous Pollution Prevention Plan and a subsequent Pollution Prevention Plan for the 2021-2026 period. Eskom has been allocated a South African national carbon budget  provided by the Government. Eskom must achieve emissions below this budget. As the carbon budgets are allocated according to a negotiation process, it is confidential and therefore the target cannot be disclosed in the 2020 CDP submission."
"YES. ESPEC's target is set by considering SBT's scientific approach, however is not approved officially in Aug, 2020. From the target of 40% reduction in 2030 from 2018-basis, a simplified year rate is calculated to be 3.3% which is larger than the well-below 2? of 1.23%. ESPEC believes that the target is science-based."
"We have set absolute targets for fiscal 2020. The total CO2 emissions of domestic business establishments decreased by 25% from the actual 6,696t-CO2 against the 5% reduction target compared to FY2018 (actual 8,896t). Regarding energy reduction activities, we were able to achieve a significant reduction in GHG emissions as a result of aggressive replacement with LED lighting at domestic offices, renewal of air conditioners, purchase of green electricity, and so on. Furthermore, from this successful experience, we have set even higher goals for 2021. By the end of FY2021, we will work to reduce CO2 emissions at domestic offices by 75%."
"We have set  up a new target last  year, using 2018 as a new baseline and working with an absolute number. We picked 2018 as the new plant was up running at full capacity, we have closed an old factory by the end of that year, and no new acquisitions are planned. Our goals are 2022 is achieved in 2020, due to Covid-19 2020 can not be categorized as a normal year, therefore we keep the same target year."
"Gas distribution, water, and wastewater utility operations will contribute to our target, which apply to 100% of our Scope 1 and 2 emissions. While not formally validated by the Science-Based Targets Initiative, this science-based commitment is consistent with the rate of reduction necessary from 2020 to 2035 to keep on track with the Paris Agreement, which aims to limit a global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees Celsius. We engaged an expert third party, Villanova University, to conduct this analysis. This target represents combined Scope 1 and 2 emissions reductions attributable to planned or ongoing initiatives that utilize existing technology. Thus, the reductions we project have a high degree of certainty. They are not based on speculative or yet unproven technologies. We are actively researching and monitoring promising developments and initiatives for future implementation, but these are not included in our projected emissions reduction for 2035. We understand technological innovation will need to occur to reach net zero, for which we announced an aspiration, but are excited by the rapid pace of innovation in the industry."
"This target refers to the component of the Essential-wide target (Abs1) relating to water and wastewater utility operations. In prior year's CDP submittal, we referred to this planned reduction of emissions, but this is now formalized as a target. We have set the target year as 2035, to be consistent with the Essential-wide target (Abs1), but we plan to achieve this water and wastewater operations target fully in 2022. While not formally validated by the Science-Based Targets Initiative, this science-based commitment is consistent with the rate of reduction necessary from 2020 to 2035 to keep on track with the Paris Agreement, which aims to limit a global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees Celsius. We engaged an expert third party, Villanova University, to conduct this analysis. This target will be achieved primarily through a contract with a retail power supplier for 100% wind power through Green-e Renewable Energy Certificates starting in 2022 for our deregulated power supply for our water and wastewater operations in PA, OH, NJ and IL. Starting June 1st, 2020,  25% of purchased power in TX has been contracted through a solar PPA. The benefits from the solar PPA and improved emission factors for both Market and Location based emission factor resulted in the  8.5% reduction in our emissions from our 2019 baseline.  We will continue to evaluate opportunities to reduce emissions further and will need to balance these potential investments with the critical need to maintain affordable and safe water supply for customers. We are excited about the pace with which electric utilities and providers are shifting their portfolios to renewable generation, which we have not accounted for in this target but which presents opportunity for further emissions reduction in states where we don't not have the option to purchase renewable energy."
"This target refers to the component of the Essential-wide target (Abs1) relating to natural gas utility operations. While not formally validated by the Science-Based Targets Initiative, this science-based commitment is consistent with the rate of reduction necessary from 2020 to 2035 to keep on track with the Paris Agreement, which aims to limit a global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees Celsius. We engaged an expert third party, Villanova University, to conduct this analysis. This target will be achieved primarily through our Long-term Infrastructure Improvement Plan to replace 3,000 miles of leak-prone pipe over 20 years, our gathering system repair program, accelerated leak detection and repair, fugitive gas reinjection during construction, and transitioning to compressed natural gas fleet vehicles where feasible. While Essential translates all emissions to a common CO2e denomination, one should note that almost all Scope 1 and 2 emissions attributable to our gas utility are fugitive methane leaks from pipes. Thus, this target can also be thought of as a methane reduction target for Essential, as the water and wastewater utility's emissions are almost all carbon dioxide. Thus, we have opted not to include a separate methane-specific target in C4.2, as this would be rather duplicative and not add value to this disclosure. This target represents combined Scope 1 and 2 emissions reductions attributable to planned or ongoing initiatives that utilize existing technology. Thus, the reductions we project have a high degree of certainty. They are not based on speculative or yet unproven technologies. We are actively researching and monitoring promising developments and initiatives for future implementation, but these are not included in our projected emissions reduction for 2035. We understand technological innovation will need to occur to reach net zero, for which we announced an aspiration, but are excited by the rapid pace of innovation in the industry."
"In order to reduce our emissions from Essentra's operations, in August 2020 sustainability targets were set that were approved by the BSC. This was communicated widely both internally and externally. It demonstrates the commitment to our sustainability strategy, especially linked to the Energy & Climate Change pillar and highlights the medium to long-term commitment towards a low-carbon business model.  This target is focused on all global operations including manufacturing. warehouses and offices across Essentra up to what constitutes 99% of Essentra's electricity consumption within operational control. Target: Commitment to reduce Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions and become carbon neutral by 2040 compared to the 2019 figures (both absolute and normalised with £ million revenue). For future reporting, we will report the progress against this goal that has been set in the annual reporting of accounts. Strategy: This target will be achieved through a programme of renewable energy projects (largely solar PV), energy efficiency improvements and emission reductions across the entire portfolio. Site level actions will include the introduction of efficient LED lighting, site insulation, clean energy pilots and energy audits to identify further opportunities. Additionally, there will be a focus on procurement of renewable energy across the portfolio. We have the ambition to run carbon neutral operations by 2040, if not before."
"Essity was among the companies adopting a Science based target early.  Our SBT was approved by the SBTi in 2018, aligned with an ambition level of 2°C at the time.  Essity however recognizes the urgency for greater efforts in the level of decarbonization required to keep global temperature increase to well-below 2°C compared to preindustrial temperatures, and we are therefore working on upgrading our SBT during 2021 to a higher ambition level, and in addition set a long-term target."
"Essity´s Scope 3 target was approved by the SBTi in December 2018. Scope 3 categories included in this target are purchased goods and services (cat. 1), upstream transportation (cat 3), downstream transportation (cat 9), waste generated in operations (cat 5) and end-of-life treatment of sold products(cat 12). These 5 categories cover 94% of the Scope 3 emissions."
"The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. has committed to reducing absolute scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions 50% by 2030 from a 2018 base year. The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. also has committed to reducing scope 3 GHG emissions from purchased goods and services, upstream transportation and distribution, and business travel 60% per unit revenue over the same timeframe. FY18 Scope 1 GHG emissions metrics restated due to updated EPA and IEA emission factors and more accurate data capture."
"This target is not yet approved by Science Based Targets Initiative, however, it is in line with the well-below 2 degrees scenario, as it aims to reduce 2.5% per year compared to the base-year of 2019.Target covers all our Scope 1&2 GHG emissions."
"This target is our long-term emission reduction target which meets slightly more than 2.1% year-on-year reductions from a 2019 baseline. This target is set for 21 years, and aims to reduce 45% (2.14% year on year reduction) of our Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions from 2019 levels."
"This target is new.Emissions resulting from the transportation of our goods has a 93.01% share in our Scope 3 GHG inventory, this is why this year we have decided to address this issue. Our target is to reduce our transportation related Scope 3 GHG emissions both upstream and downstream, by 7.4% until 2026.This target is a company-wide target that includes the GHG emissions of all land and marine transportation activities.We have also checked the ambition-level of this target with Science Based Targets Initiative's target setting tool, and our target is 2 degrees aligned according to this tool."

"As part of Etsy's larger goal of achieving Net Zero by 2030 and continuing to run a carbon neutral business now, Etsy has committed to science based target of a 50% absolute reduction in Scope 1 and 2 Market based greenhouse gas emissions by 2030."
"As part of Etsy's larger goal of achieving Net Zero by 2030 and continuing to run a carbon neutral business now, Etsy has committed to a 13.5% absolute reduction in Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. We submitted three additional calculations to SBTi that were included in our 2019 baseline but are pending public re-statement."
"In 2020, we achieved our commitment to sourcing 100% of our electricity from renewable sources by 2020, which aimed to reduce  our Scope 2 market-based GHG emissions from electricity to zero by 2020.  This applied to 100% of Etsy's global operations, inclusive of office operations and our computing infrastructure. In 2019, we revised the scope of our goal to go beyond Scope 2 market-based GHG emissions, to include our cloud computing footprint, classified as Scope 3 Upstream Leased Assets. This goal is part of Etsy's top line goal to build long-term resilience by eliminating our carbon impacts and fostering responsible resource use. Progress is measured against the 2016 fiscal year, and targets are for the fiscal year. Etsy will aim to continue to keep emissions from Scope 2 electricity to zero as we work toward our other absolute reduction goals for Net Zero by 2030."
". Eurazeo's long-lasting commitment to tackle climate issues has been strengthened in 2020 with the ambitious O+ engagement to become carbon net neutral by 2040 at the latest. Eurazeo aims to align its activities with a scenario limiting global warming to a well below 2°C threshold. This commitment led us to establish reduction targets which are calculated using a world-renowned scientific methodology: Science-Based Targets Initiative (SBTi). At management company level, the scope 1 and 2 objectives, validated per SBTi's scientific committee, are the following:• 2025: Eurazeo commits to increase annual sourcing of renewable electricity from 9% in 2017 to 80%• 2030: Eurazeo commits to reduce scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 80% per employee from a 2017 base year.  Regarding reduction of scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions, both absolute (gross scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions) and intensity (scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions per employee) sub-targets have been presented to the SBTI. These targets have been submitted and approved by the SBTI during 2020.. In order to reduce scope 1 and 2 related emissions, Eurazeo signed in 2018 a green energy contract for its Paris headquarters. Eurazeo also aims to improve its office building energy efficiency."

Regarding scope 3 related emissions, a first target on business travels (from teams of Eurazeo Group) related emissions has been set during 2020. This is the target ABS2 presented here. However, our portfolio companies make up most our scope 3 emissions. In this context, Eurazeo has presented another target to the SBTI (still under review and validation), enlarging the reduction scope from single business travels to investments/portfolio companies. We are waiting for the final version of the ""Finance methodological guidance for scope 3"" from the SBTI. The working hypothesis is to screen 100% of our investments' emissions and to engage companies emitting 30% of these emissions to set reduction targets within the next five years."

"In 2019, Eversource set an industry-leading goal to be carbon neutral in our operations by 2030.  We believe it is important to lead by example in reducing our emissions and demonstrate that carbon neutrality is achievable. Our customers, employees, shareholders, and other stakeholders expect this of us and we are proud to know our progress toward carbon neutrality benefits the overarching climate change mitigation plans of the states we serve. To this end, we remain focused on clean energy and searching for innovative solutions to mitigate our operational emissions. We are also preparing to address any gaps in our emissions that are unavoidable through creative carbon offset programs that not only contribute to our carbon balance but also benefit the communities in which we operate. In 2020, we saw a decrease in our overall emissions by 17% compared to 2018 and 3% compared to 2019. In light of the challenging year requiring changes in our operations due to COVID-19, a temporary policy requiring one person per vehicle was implemented — an essential step to keep employees safe and adhere to official health recommendations. This safety measure, however, resulted in an increased consumption of fuel and, subsequently, a 10% increase in fleet emissions compared to 2019. Despite this increase, we were still able to achieve an overall reduction in our emissions through dedicated programs, including those that have reduced methane and SF6 leaks, and improved efficiencies at our facilities."

"As part of its Strategy 2030, EVN decided to set the following climate-related targets: (i) Achieve carbon neutrality for certain Group companies. It was decided that EVN Wasser GmbH, which is the drinking water supply company in Lower Austria, should become the Group's first carbon neutral company in course of the 2020/21 financial year (please see target ""Abs 1""). Measures to achieve such goal include the use of 100% renewable electricity only, the replacement of liquefied gas installation by heating pumps, whereas any remaining CO2 emissions shall be offset through Gold Standard certificates (or similar).(ii) As of the 2021/22 financial year, additional Group companies shall achieve carbon neutrality, details to be disclosed in the CDP 2022.(iii) EVN has the target to reduce by half its specific CO2 emissions (in tons) per generated GWh based on further massive expansion of renewable generation by 2030 versus 2005  (please see target ""Int 1"").(iv) EVN aims to join the Science Based Targets initiative, the Commitment Letter to the SBTi was sent in June 2021.  In July 2021 EVN was recognized as committed to setting science-based targets. Science-based targets that are aligned with the SBTi criteria are currently being developed in order to fulfil the four step process of the SBTi Call to Action."
"That target is a science-based: According to the SBT initiative a science-based target has the following definition: ""Targets adopted by companies to reduce GHG emissions are considered ''science-based” if they are in line with the level of decarbonization required to keep global temperature increase below 2°C compared to preindustrial temperatures, as described in the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)."" (SBT initiative, 2015: Sectoral Decarbonization Approach, page 7). The Evonik target of an annual reduction of 3% is well in line with the ambition requested."

"Exelon established this third generation GHG goal in 2017 to reduce its emissions from internal operations (100% of emissions controllable by our employees and processes) 15% from a 2015 baseline by 2022 (2.2% reduction per year).   At the time, a 2.2% year over year reduction was recommended by the EPA to be in line with the Paris Accord. Our goal was intended to be achieved be despite new equipment coming online due to business growth expected in 2018.  The actual public facing goal is on Market-based accounting, allowing for use of clean energy purchases to be part of performance, but per CDP requirements, the goal is being reported here based on absolute location-based accounting.  Emissions sources covered by this goal includes all building and support equipment electricity uses, emergency and auxiliary stationary combustion sources, fleet vehicles, natural gas distribution systems, SF6 electrical insulated equipment, and refrigerant sources.  Our controllable emissions were 10.5% of our technical Scope 1 & 2 inventory. However, emissions not included under this goal are those we own but do not have direct control over and which are measured and managed under different GHG emissions programs and considered to be customer-driven.  These emission sources include our Scope 1 emissions from electric generation since the level of operation for these units is determined by grid demand for electricity and resulting plant dispatch as determined by the grid balancing authority (outside of our full operational control since we have a commitment to the grid to be available as needed to meet demand); and Scope 2 emissions associated with transmission and distribution line losses which are primarily driven by the grid emissions rate and the volume of electricity required to be delivered to utility customers (similarly outside of our day-to-day operational control since all of the electricity we deliver is purchased per public utility commission requirements). It should be noted, that for these other sources, Exelon does maintain performance management indicators such as lbs/MWh generated and % loss of MWh delivered are used to ensure a continued focus on GHG emission reduction efforts being implemented.  Looking across these three performance programs ensures ongoing management of emissions across 100% of our corporate-wide GHG inventory."
"In 2017 the company set an annual rolling goal for carbon neutrality of our Scope 1, Scope 2 (location-based) and Scope 3 (internal business travel, waste, and employee commuting emissions. This rolling target has been fulfilled each year since. We understand that CDP suggests only gross emissions be accounted for here, prior to offsets, however we recognize offsets as a key tool in our carbon neutrality strategy and we have elected to report this achievement. We plan to explore science-based targets within the next 2 years."
"This target focuses on reducing emissions through efficiency and purchasing 100% renewable energy at our office locations; and includes our RE1 Target. In 2019, rooftop solar was being set up at the Seattle headquarters, and will be fully operational in 2020. The company has rolled out a new ''Green Leasing” policy that requires the option of renewable energy at facilities for all new leases and renewals by 2031 to help achieve this goal. Many of these locations are leased facilities and in 2031 we will have reached 100% turnover of the leases."
"This year we have had our targets approved by the SBTi.  This target demonstrates that we are committed to reducing the whole company's Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 50% by the year 2030. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic forcing our offices to close and sites to be consolidated, this has significantly reduced  our current scope 1 and 2 footprint and given us a good platform to achieve this target. To help guard against emissions returning to a pre-pandemic level, we have worked with colleagues across the globe to identify carbon reduction, energy efficiency and renewable energy opportunities. To date, over 40 projects have been identified. Throughout FY22 we will continue to work towards implementing these projects to drive progress towards our 2030 commitment."
"This year we have had our targets approved by the SBTi. This target demonstrates that we are committed to reducing our Scope 3 emissions from purchased goods and services, business travel and Well-to-Tank by 15% by 2030. In previous years, we have only tracked and reported Scope 3 emissions related to air travel. In FY21, we engaged external experts to undertake a full assessment of our Scope 3 emissions, using best practice models and a combination of procurement and financial data available for FY19, the last full year before the exceptional circumstances of COVID-19. This initial analysis estimated our baseline Scope 3 emissions in FY19 as 495.3 thousand tonnes. The biggest contributor to this total is purchased goods and services (72%), followed by business travel (10%) and capital goods (6%). Therefore, focusing on these three categories will be key to reducing the company's footprint."

"Faurecia has set itself the goal of achieving carbon neutrality for its scope 1, 2 ."
Faurecia has set itself the goal of reducing Scope 3 controlled (excl. use phase emissions) according to SBTi until 2030. Faurecia intends to reach full carbon neutrality by 2050.
"Please note: our baseline year is a location based metric, but our target is a market based metric. We set it this way due the nature of our carbon reduction activities.It is important to note that our properties did not operate under typical conditions in 2020. We believe that the large reductions we saw may have been influenced by the shutdowns associated with the COVID19 pandemic."
"Based on the emissions in 2019, and climate scenario aligned with a 2 degree temperature goal in 2030, the targeted reduction from 2019 will be 46.2%."
We aligned our targets with the Absolute Contraction Methode; with our target we exceed the minimum reduction required by this approach.
Mugello Racing Circuit has set a target to purchase 100% of electric energy from renewable sources with Guarantee of Origin certificates by 2021.
"In absolute terms, the target is to reduce 32% by 2030 from 2009 base-year. By 2020 Ferrovial achieved a reduction of 268,958 tCO2e (268,958 tCO2e reduction of emissions in 2020 divided by 1,139,094 tCO2e emissions in 2009 base year = 23,61 %). In other words, 73,78% of the target was achieved (23,61 % of reduction divided by 32 % of target = 73,78% target achieved). This is evidence that a growth in business no longer necessarily entails extra emissions. Each division has established reduction measures for achievement of the targets: 1) Vehicle fleets and machinery. Initiatives here consist of improving the energy efficiency of these assets, via measures including improvements to criteria used in procurement, renting, or leasing, courses to promote efficient driving, the use of alternative fuels, and alternatives with hybrid engines. In this sense, the number of cars powered by alternative energies has increased. 2) Company mobility plans. 3) Energy efficiency in buildings. Implementation of proactive energy efficiency measures in buildings used as corporate headquarters. 4) Green procurement. The purchase of electricity from renewable sources reduces GHG emissions because the CO2/kWh emission factor is zero. In 2020, Ferrovial Group consumed 68% of its electricity from renewable sources (both certificates of origin and self-produced by the Ferrovial). 5) Current economic situation. Our estimation indicates that once the economic situation improves, emissions in absolute terms will increase lightly.Ferrovial is committed to continuing to advance hand in hand with SBTi, with the intention of aligning its targets with the most ambitious scenario. Proof of this is the participation in the public consultation on the SBTi Net-Zero Standard Draft or in the SBTi Net-Zero Road Test project."
"The company also commits to reduce all relevant scope 3 emissions (excluding capital goods and purchased goods and services) 20% by 2030 from the 2012 base-year. Scope 3 categories covered by the target represent around 55% of yearly scope 3 emissions. From 2012 to 2020, Ferrovial has reduced covered scope 3 emissions by 1,119,815 tCO2eq. This divided by 2,853,675 tCO2eq (covered emissions in base year), results in a 39,24% emissions reduction. As the target was to reduce 20% of base year emissions, the target is 196,2% achieved.    Some reduction initiatives that we have implemented, and we will carry out: - Incorporation of energy efficiency criteria in procurement and sub-contracting of services. - Development of technology and processes geared towards optimizing the avoidance of emissions. - Inclusion of energy efficiency measures - Workshop with companies in which we are the investors. - The relationship with regulatory bodies and governments is key as a way to influence regulatory trends which are in charge of developing new legal requirements that affect the company and third parties (fuel and energy-related activities, used of sold product, purchased goods and services…).Ferrovial is committed to continuing to advance hand in hand with SBTi, with the intention of aligning its targets with the most ambitious scenario. Proof of this is the participation in the public consultation on the SBTi Net-Zero Standard Draft or in the SBTi Net-Zero Road Test project."
"This target is the long time-frame of target Abs-1. As part of our Deep Decarbonization Path, the General Shareholder Meeting has approved our ambition to reach carbon neutrality in 2050. This includes an 80% reduction of the S1+S2 emissions from base year (2009) and compensation of the remaining emissions. Ferrovial is committed to continuing to advance hand in hand with SBTi, with the intention of aligning its targets with the most ambitious scenario. Proof of this is the participation in the public consultation on the SBTi Net-Zero Standard Draft or in the SBTi Net-Zero Road Test project."
"In 2020, we achieved and exceeded our goal to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions 25% by 2022.  Specifically, we reduced our emissions 41% in between 2014 and 2020.  (We initially achieved our goal in 2018 -- 4 years ahead of schedule -- and we continue to reduce our emissions further.) These reductions were the result of investments in energy efficiency, improved operations and maintenance, increased space utilization, the ongoing decarbonization of the electric power grid, and moderate temperatures within our footprint for parts of the year."
"This target was created in 2017 and it is included in the 2018-2022 Sustainability Plan in line with the Group's commitment to reduce the Scope 2 emissions contributing to the fight against climate change. Since the target's creation, Fincantieri has reduced its CO2 emissions by 88,702 tons.In 2020, Fincantieri further improved management of the environmental aspects, and considering that the Group was also hit by the pandemic that led to the temporary suspension and slowdown of production activities, in general Fincantieri recorded a drop in consumption of heating fuels, water and raw materials, and less waste. The reduction made a positive impact on greenhouse gas emissions."
"The emission targets were set for the Scandinavian operations of the company, which in 2017 were 75% of the total company emissions. The base year (2017) emission was 51 metric tons CO2e, and the result at the end of 2018 was 34 metric tons CO2e and, in 2020, emissions from Scandinavian operations were 23 metric tons CO2e. The reductions have been achieved by ensuring the use of green energy from our suppliers and closing offices."
"2018 was the first year of reporting Scope 3 for Business Travel. The metric is for Scandinavian operations only and constitutes 75% of the total company travel. The base year 2018: 559 metric tons CO2 and in 2019 the emissions were 323.5 tCO2e and in 2020, 44.4 tCO2e. The reason for having significantly lower emissions in 2020 in partly due to the global pandemic, however, FPC is dedicated to continuously minimize the environmental impact from business travel."
"Finnair's long-term target is carbon free flying by 2045 (net emissions). Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, 2020 figures are showing unusual performance, since passenger demand was weak and unnecessary flying was minimized. Gross emissions are expected to rise 2021 onward until revolutionary technologies are available."
"Finnair set a new mid-term target 2020 to half net CO2 emissions by the end of 2025, compared to 2019 figures.  The covered emissions in base year is net-emissions, i.e. the use of economic measures have been included.  Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, 2020 figures are showing unusual performance, since passenger demand was weak and unnecessary flying was minimized.  Even 2020 Finnair already achieved the target, we keep this target valid, since when traffic is returning back to 100%, the gross emissions will start to grow."
"At the end of 2022, our non-flight operations will be carbon-free. The scope includes the use of energy by facilities and the use of fuel by ground equipment."
"We have set a target to reduce our absolute GHG emissions by 20% by 2027 from our 2017 baseline. This target does not include our 4Refuel emissions, however we intend to develop a reduction plan for 4Refuel throughout 2021. To achieve our target, we continue to invest in energy efficiency and emission reduction activities across our regions, including procurement of renewable energy, increasing fleet efficiency, and implementing behavioural conservation activities at our branches and sites.  It is important to note that 2020 emissions are significantly lower partially due to business impacts of COVID-19. Some emissions are likely to return as these impacts lessen. We estimated emissions without business impacts of COVID-19, estimated based on 2019 actual emissions less emission reduction projects carried out in 2020. These emissions equaled 97,472 tCo2e which would put us at an estimated 10 percent reduction in scope one and scope two emissions (market) from 2017 to 2020."

"GHG Emissions by Scope  (Please refer to the attached First Pacific 2020 ESG Report, pp. 40-41 and First Pacific 2020 GHG Account Report, p. 7)During 2020, our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions at Head Office amounted to 95.5 tonnes of CO2-e. The table below shows that GHG emissions from purchased electricity (Scope 2) and other indirect GHG emissions from air travel and paper waste disposal (Scope 3) dominated First Pacific's overall emissions. Together they account for 96.1% of the Company's overall emissions, whereas direct GHG emissions from mobile fuel consumption (Scope 1) only accounted for 3.9%.

We recorded a decrease of 68.5% compared with the base year 2013 and 44.2% from the 2019 level. Scope 3 emissions from air travel, which was the largest emissions contributor in 2019, has fallen significantly due to First Pacific's suspension of all business travel since March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2019, First Pacific committed to reducing its total GHG emissions by 10% in 2021 and 15% in 2022 compared with the 2019 total level. Given the unprecedented situation caused by COVID-19 pandemic, we have already reached the target in 2020. We understand that changes in business practices resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic are likely to further affect our business travel in 2021 and beyond. Having far exceeded our GHG reduction goals we are currently assessing what is the ''new normal” on which to establish new targets. First Pacific's GHG emissions management efforts are recognized. We received the CarbonCare® Label in 2020 for the seventh consecutive year as well as the CarbonCare® Star Label in 2020."
"After surpassing our 2021 intensity-based target three years early, we have set new science-based targets to reduce our absolute scope 1 and scope 2 GHG emissions by 20% by 2028, relative to 2020. This target is in line with science-based climate goals to limit the global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees Celsius (WB2C) above pre-industrial levels. Our 2028 absolute emissions reduction target is based on the Science Based Targets SBT-Tool-v.1.2.1 ''Absolute contraction | W2BC” scenario."
"In 2021, we committed to achieving net zero emissions by 2050 across scopes 1 and 2, in line with a 1.5°C warming scenario. Our 2050 net zero target is based on the CSO Carbon Metric ''SSP1-1.9 w-Global Pathway” scenario."
"In 2020, FirstEnergy updated our GHG reduction goal. We believe this new greenhouse gas reduction goal aligns with our electric utility industry peers and our company's long-term strategy. We have chosen a challenging near-term 2019 baseline, as opposed to a more traditional 2005 starting point. And to reflect our transformation to a regulated utility, we've included emissions associated with our transmission and distribution operations as well as our generation. The new goal also aligns with the Paris Agreement."
In 2020 FirstEnergy updated our GHG reduction goal and introduced a 2050 carbon-neutral target. We believe this new carbon neutral goal aligns with our electric utility industry peers and our company's long-term strategy. We have chosen a challenging near-term 2019 baseline to reflect our transformation to a regulated utility and included emissions associated with our transmission and distribution operations as well as our small generation fleet. The carbon neutral goal also aligns with the intent of the Paris Agreement.
"FirstRand has set targets for scope 1 and 2 emissions for the group's South African operations, based on science and aligned with the Paris Agreement goals. Targets adopted by companies for reducing carbon emissions are considered ''science based” if they are in line with the level of decarbonisation required to keep the global temperature increase below 2°C compared to pre-industrial levels. FirstRand chose to model data and set targets using an absolute emissions contraction methodology rather than a sectoral decarbonisation approach (based on the buildings sector) as it was considered more appropriate for the group's operations. The resulting targets are a 75% emissions reduction target for Scope 1 and 2 emissions for South African operations (i.e. those directly related to the group's operations) by the year 2050 (against a 2015 emissions baseline), with additional short and medium interim targets set to track progress."
The business expanded rapidly over the reporting year and as such target was not acheived.  Additionally better reporting has seen that sources of GHG were not included previously.

"In addition to  our approved Absolute targets, we also had Supplier engagement targets approved as follows, ""FPH also commits that 87% of its' suppliers by spend covering purchased goods and services and use of sold products will have science-based emission reduction targets by, FY2024 from a 2019 base year.” F&P targets set with Science Based Targets relate to financial year.The emissions covered in the reporting year relate to the 'net' emissions after the removal of emissions covered by renewable energy certificate."
"Fiskars Group is committed to climate action and has set science-based targets to reduce greenhouse gases in line with the most ambitious goals of the Paris Climate Agreement.  Fiskars Group's science-based targets were approved by the Science Based Targets Initiative in 2020.  Fiskars Group commits to reduce absolute scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 60% by 2030 from a 2017 base year.In 2020, Group-wide GHG emissions decreased by 28% compared to the previous year. Compared to the 2017 base year, Fiskars Group has reached a reduction of 44% as a result of the energy-saving actions and investments in renewable energy. In total 63% of the electricity Fiskars Group purchased was from renewable sources."
"Fiskars Group commits to reduce absolute scope 3 GHG emissions from upstream transportation and distribution 30% by 2030 from a 2018 base year. In 2020 Fiskars Group transportation emissions remained at the same level. In 2020 company's emissions from inbound and outbound transportation were 26,000 t CO2e (2019: 26,000 t CO2e). The COVID-19 pandemic affected the business reducing visibility, increasing uncertainty with stores closing and traffic decreasing. At the same time, demand in many of the categories increased, as people spent more time at home. This impacted Fiskars Group ability to optimize transportation and reduce emissions. Fiskars Group's logistics team is continuously optimizing the routes and volumetric efficiency with our logistic partners as well as engaging our partners to our emission reduction target."

Flex commits to reduce absolute scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions 50% by 2030 from a 2019 base year. This target was approved by Flex in 2020 and formally approved by SBTi in 2021.The targets covering greenhouse gas emissions from company operations (scopes 1 and 2) are consistent with reductions required to keep warming to 1.5°C.
"The target was overachieved in 2020. The Covid-19 had an impact on our operations, resulting in a decrease of 31% of our year on year emissions in 2020 compared to 2019. Nonetheless, our operational sustainability plan was not put on hold during the pandemic and emission reduction initiatives were implemented."
"Munich airport has committed an explicit absolute internal target for CO2-reduction activities of 2300 t CO2 in 2020 (efficency activities). To calculate this target, all emission reduction activities, which were fully implemented in 2020, are counted. Munich Airport over-achieved this target and calculated a saving in emissions of 2373 t CO2 in 2020."
"This is a stabilization Target. Munich Airport had strived for achieving carbon-neutral growth until 2020 despite new facilities and a dynamic growth of operations. The considered carbon footprint covers 100% of scope 1 and 2 emissions, as well as scope 3 emissions produced due to the energy use of third parties for buildings, equipment and transportation (10% of the total scope 3 emissions, named as Scope 3a according to ACA).  The current value is 107.960,4 t so the airport achieved the goal."
"Munich Airport had committed to become a carbon-neutral airport by 2030. That means: We are going to reduce our attributable CO2 emission by 60% and compensate the remaining 40%. To achieve that, Munich Airport plans investments of about 150 million euros between now and 2030 – even if these expenditures cannot always be funded through savings."
"The supply of pre-conditioned air for the airlines should reduce the emissions of APU (auxiliary power units). Base year was 2015, the last year without use of PCA (pre-conditioned air). For 2016 the target was a reduction of 3800 t (or 9%) and the reduction target for 2017 was 9500 t (or 22.5%).  For 2018 the reduction target was 14650 t CO2. The target in 2019 of 15.200 t CO2  was overbid by a total reduction of 20851 t CO2. In 2020, the target of 19.000 could not be achieved because of the corona crisis."
The target is focused on the purchase of renewable energy in all our operations in order to achieve zero emissions in scope 2 in the following years.

"As you can see from the figure, our own Scope 1 + Scope 2 emissions are so low, that the greatest impact we can have is by Scope 3 in our supply chains and at our customers. The reason why 2020 saw a significant step towards the goal was a warm year with less need to heat during May-August when the wood chip plant is down and necessary heating would happen with oil if the sun was not out."
"Shipping accounts for 81 percent of our global energy use (and 40%+ of our total Scope 1 Emissions in 2020). Therefore we determined that in order to make  substantial reductions in our organizations greenhouse gas emissions, our vessel shipping was the most critical area to address. In 2018, we set the goal of reducing our emissions 10% by 2025 compared to our 2018 baseline consumption. To achieve this goal, we are upgrading our owned fleet to more fuel-efficient ships and optimizing our shipping routes. For many years, we've owned and operated a fleet of eleven ships that transport our products to North America from Central and South America. Now, these are being replaced with the six new full-container ships and we're estimating this will result in a savings of nearly 19 thousand metric tons of fuel each year. Two of these ships were launched in 2020, and the remaining four were launched in 2021.  Each vessel also meets the most stringent emission control regulation and includes:•An Integrated Condition Monitoring System in all the machinery and combustion engines in the vessel, the purpose of which is to continuously calculate and identify areas for efficiency improvements. •Alternate Marine Power (AMP), an anti-pollution method that stops the consumption of diesel fuel and minimize air pollution when the vessel halts at a port. •A new Hull design at the front of the ship, to increase speed, range, efficiency and stability. •Hybrid Exhaust Gas Scrubber system to reduce any harmful sulfur oxides that may be emitted from the exhaust gases. With the addition of our new fuel efficient vessels, we achieved this goal well before our deadline of 2025. Therefore, we determined it necessary to up our ambition, by setting our first ever company-wide target (outlined below). However, our work of reducing our emissions from our vessels is far from done. With our commitment to the Science Based Targets initiative in 2020, emissions reductions from vessel shipping will now fall under our broader company-wide goal of reducing our GHG emissions by 27.5% by 2030. Reducing our vessel emissions is a critical element of our climate action strategy."
"To expand our efforts and work with others in the fight against climate change, we committed to the Science-Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) in December 2020, which aims to drive ambitious action by enabling companies to set science-based, GHG emissions reduction targets to assist with limiting global warming. As the first global marketer of fruits and vegetables to announce our partnership with the initiative in 2020, this is a significant milestone for us. To help us manage our emissions, as well as water and waste, we utilize a proprietary environmental action tool and database that allows us to track data facility by facility, covering 100 percent of our global operations. This tool, created in accordance with rigorous emissions calculation methodologies, allows us to calculate our company-wide scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions, and gives us the data we need to set GHG emissions baselines and develop our science-based targets. We convened a cross cutting group of executives this year to develop our Science Based Target. Our teams  determined our target, and achieved internal validation. Our next step is to await validation from the SBTi organization that our target is SBT approved. However, the internal work is already underway. Our Scope 1 and 2 target has a 2019 base year and is enterprise(company)-wide. Our original vessel emissions reduction target will fall under this new goal, and will be a critical step in our roadmap towards achieving 27.5% reduction in company-wide emissions by 2030."

"We are working towards implementing a strict global travel policy, building on the successes of our Continental Europe (CE) travel policy. Our CE travel policy is much more ambitious in that any journey less than 4 hours will have to be taken by train instead of plane.  We are also working with our travel providers to help reduce unnecessary air travel. In previous years, we  set up a travel working group with stakeholders across our international offices to help reduce unnecessary business travel and understand risks and opportunities. All technological changes required are already in place or budgeted as part of a global efficiency drive.  For instance Microsoft teams has been rolled out across all of our offices and we have successfully hosted many virtual events and conferences."
We are measuring our carbon footprint in each office and working with each office for energy efficiency improvements and we are investing in renewable electricity.
"We have introduced measures in each office such as; removing personal printers, automatically setting the printers to double sided printing and agile working (no one has their own desk which is shown to reduce paper use as a result of a more digital way of working)"
"We are collecting data on plastic use from each office and engaging with the office environmental coordinators to phase these out gradually. Every employee was issued with a reusable coffee cup on World Environment Day in 2018. Examples of some key initiatives include plastic cups being taken out from the kitchen areas and being replaced with glasses and mugs. We will have to caveat this target in the short-term due to safety and hygiene concerns as a result of COVID-19 but any disposable items brought in will be a temporary measure only.  We are still committed to engaging with all of our office coordinators to phase out single -use plastic plates, food containers, cups, cutlery and straws as a minimum."
"In 2020 due to the pandemic there was a reduction in operational activity, this is reflected in a decrease in emissions in all scopes"
"We have set goals consistent with the Science Based Target initiative (SBTi). Our commitment to the SBTi has been approved, and we had planned to submit a letter for approval on our science-based target emission reductions goals for scope 1, 2 & 3 during 2020, but this was delayed due to Covid, and was finally submitted in 2021. We set 2018 as our base year, and our planned reductions are to continue occurring through 2030, at which point we expect to have achieved a 50 reduction in scope 1 & 2 emissions and a 30% reduction in scope 3 emissions."
"Our Scope 3 target is based on Category 1 - Purchased Goods and Services which in 2018 represented 81% of our Scope 3 emissions. Our target also includes Category 3 Fuel & Energy - which represents 3% of our Scope 3 emissions.  Combined this represents 84% of our Scope 3 goal.  We have submitted our target for approval by the Science-Based Target Initiative.   Our emissions were greatly reduced in 2020 due to the Pandemic and  we expect emissions to increase in 2021 back towards 2019 levels. However, because of our science-based target program and planned innovations, we believe that we will be able to steer a course of emission reductions to meet our reduction goals by 2030."

Fugro has committed to transition the energy use of its offices and facilities towards green energy as far as available in the countries op operation.
"Our ambition is to support the transition towards carbon neutrality, sustainable infrastructure and climate resilience. For Fugro's own operations, our ambition is to be carbon neutral by 2035, covering all direct and indirect emissions from our operations (scope 1 and scope 2 emissions). Dedicated programs are underway to reduce the CO2  footprint of our vessels and other larger assets, amongst others by increasingly using lightly crewed vessels and remote services, as well as electrified and hybrid assets in the land site characterisation business line. Fugro aims to achieve net zero performance by actually bringing down CO2 emissions (not by offsetting, unless there is no other solution)."
"This is the Company's medium-term target, formulated in July 2018.A 31% reduction vs. FY 2013 by FY 2030 equates to an annual reduction of 2.1%, which fits in with the target reduction 2° C by 2050.We have been advancing activities to reduce emissions, and the target for FY 2030 of a 31% reduction (369,817 t-CO2e) represents a 52% reduction vs. emissions in FY 2006 (775,538 t-CO2e), the base year of our emissions-reduction activities.?It also represents a 78% reduction vs. the UN base year of 1990 (FY1995 for greenhouse gases other than CO2).In June 2021, the Company revised its target upward to a reduction of at least 46% vs. 2013 figures in 2030, for a pace of reduction based on a target of 1.5°C. We also committed to full carbon neutrality throughout the entire supply chain for 2050."

"This is the Company's long-term target, formulated in July 2018.An 80% reduction vs. FY 2013 by FY 2050 fits in with the target reduction 2° C by 2050.Accordingly, although we have not sought SBTi approval of our targets, we believe that they are at least equivalent to the 2° C or 1.5° C target.However, at present we have not disclosed our base-year emissions.The Scope 3 emissions during product use currently disclosed are for our products provided to the consumer sector and represent only a portion of emissions, not total emissions for the entire Company.In June 2021, the Company committed to a target of full carbon neutrality throughout the entire supply chain for 2050.The Company's products number approximately 450,000 types. Due to this large number, the Company has not yet established a method of calculating emissions during product use (Scope 3, Category 11).We believe in establishing a calculation method the following conditions will need to be taken into consideration:(1) The need to cover at least 80% of calculated emissions(2) The needs for objective verifiability and the ability to total figures with stability each year(3) The need to reflect the results of Company's reduction effortsThe Company plans to receive third-party verification of Scope 3 emissions (upstream and downstream) by February 2021."
"Following the SBTi approval of our previous target in 2017 to reduce CO2 emissions by 30% in 2030, we upgraded our target in July 2020. The target to reduce Fujifilm Group's carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from Scope 1 and Scope 2 has been raised from 30% to 45% compared to the FY2013 level. This target has been certified as being WB2°C (well below 2°C) by SBT initiative."
"Following the SBTi approval of our previous target in 2017 to reduce CO2 emissions by 30% in 2030, we upgraded our target in July 2020. The target to reduce Fujifilm Group's CO2 emissions across the entire product lifecycle (from material procurement to product manufacturing, transportation, use and disposal) has been raised from 30% to 45% compared to the FY2013 level. This target has been certified as being WB2°C (well below 2°C) by SBT initiative."
"In 2019 we have set our new targets of introducing renewable energy, ""Converting 100 % of purchased electric power to renewable energy-derived power by FY2050""  as a long-term target in order to accelerate the transition to the decarbonized society.Highly functional films that the Fujifilm Group produces, including films used in displays, require high-temperature steam in some of its manufacturing processes such as film formation and drying. For this reason, the company uses in-house co-generation systems capable of generating high-temperature steam required for film-formation and drying processes and electricity for use in other processes at the same time, so as to maintain a high level of energy efficiency in manufacturing.In its target for renewable energy usage, Fujifilm strives to adopt renewable energies to cover 50% of electricity purchased by 2030, and raise the ratio to 100% by 2050. At the same time, the company will embrace new technologies, including the usage of renewables-based hydrogen fuel for in-house co-generation systems capable of generating high-temperature steam and electricity at the same time, thereby achieving zero carbon emissions in all energies used.The target aims to achieve zero carbon emissions by 2050 by combining the use of electricity derived from renewable resources and the introduction of renewables-based hydrogen fuel for in-house co-generation systems. The Climate Group, the international non-profit which runs the RE100 initiative, recognizes that this target is in line with the purpose of RE100. FUJIFILM Holdings has signed up to RE100 to show its way of decarbonization to the society, and lead the movement for actualizing a non-carbon society.This target is our ""net-zero target"" and is consistent with the vision of RE100."
This target was approved by SBTi in August 2017 and was upgraded to 1.5 degree in 2020. Financial year is used for base and target year.
"The scope of ""upstream & downstream"" is ""Scope 3 category 1 + category 11"".This goal was approved by SBTi in August 2017. We achieved over 100% against the goal for FY2020, with the main contributors being the development and launch of products with top-level energy efficiency, our prompting to suppliers to reduce CO2 emissions.Although we expect to reduce CO2 emissions for FY2021 as well through our actions for improvement, we will stick with our current SBT goal for the time being considering the impact of revenue growth. We will review our SBT goal as necessary based on our business environment and management policies."
"This target has been approved by the SBTi in August 2017. We used the SDA (Sectional Dicarbonation Approch) ""other Industry""  provided by SBTi. Financial year is used for base and target year."
"In the reporting year (From April 1, 2020 to March 31, 2021), GHG emission amount (Scope 1+2) was reduced by approximately 28 % in comparison with the base year (From April 1, 2017 to March 31, 2018). In the reporting year, the business portfolio was reviewed. In addition, due to the impact of COVID-19 measures, some areas were restricted in production."
"In the reporting year (From April 1, 2020 to March 31, 2021), GHG emission amount (Scope 3) was reduced by approximately 14 % in comparison with the base year (From April 1, 2017 to March 31, 2018). In the reporting year, production activity declined by a business portfolio review and orders declined by due to stagnant capital investment by specific customers. In addition, due to the impact of COVID-19 measures, some areas were restricted in production."
"While the target was set in the base year 2018, 2020 usage data was much lower than expected due to the COVID-19 pandemic, this was due to a drop in production volumes meaning less energy was consumed."

Galaxy is committed to Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) and setting a highly ambitious target to transition to low carbon economy. The target is set at Galaxy Surfactants Group level. Currently we are in target development phase. The next course of action is submission of above mentioned target for validation by Science-Based Targets initiative.
"Target coverage: Alloga site in Burgdorf and Galexis sites in Ecublens and Niederbipp. Covered emissions in base year include CO2e of Alloga site and Galexis sites. To reduce CO2 emissions, year-on-year rolling targets are being agreed with the Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN) for the Alloga site in Burgdorf and the Galexis sites in Ecublens and Niederbipp. The sub-target for 2020 was to save 189t CO2 compared to 2016. 92% of the sub-target was achieved."
"Target coverage: Bichsel laboratory site in Interlaken. To reduce CO2 emissions, year-on-year rolling targets are being agreed with the Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN) for the Bichsel site in Interlaken.  Bichsel is part of Galenica Group since 2019."
"Galp established a target of reducing 40% its scope 1 + 2 (market-based) GHG emissions by 2030, compared to 2017 base year. Target is company wide and includes all operated emissions, even the ones from non operated upstream assets. We considered this to be a SBT, well-below 2ºC aligned and will be shortly submitted to SBTi for official approval, when possible for O&G sector. In 2020 Galp reduced 6.0% (37.4% of the target) its scope 1+2 (market-based) GHG emissions compared to previous year (2019). The SBTi methodology for the oil and gas sector has not yet been finalized  and lauched so it is not possible for integrated oil and gas companies to validate targets under the Science-Based Targets initiative. Galp is involved in the working group that has been developing the SBTi Oil & Gas methodology and will evaluate its impact on the targets that have been defined once it is finalized."
"Our based emission are 21,230  tons , when we'll start our emissions target, we will reduces emissions to 19,956.2  tons, it will reduces 6 %."
"We have committed through the Fashion Industry Charter for Climate Action toachieve a 30 per cent aggregate GHG emission reductions in scope 1, 2 and 3 of theGreenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Standard by 2030, against a baseline of noearlier than 2015."
This target covers our owned and operated facilities. We have revised this baseline from previously reported numbers to account for our acquisition of Janie and Jack which occurred in March of 2019.
"This target covers our Scope 1 + 2 emissions (market-based). In 2021, we announced the divestitures of Janie and Jack and Intermix. We will revise the baseline in next year's response to account for this change."
"Our Scope 3 emission reduction target focuses on purchased goods & services. Our purchased goods & services impacts include emissions from our Tier 1 & 2 suppliers (i.e., cut & sew facilities, dying facilities, fabric mills etc) as well as the embodied carbon of our products (the upstream impact of the cotton, wool, leather, polyester, etc. supply chains).  Our target is intended toaddress the main sources of these GHG emissions by reducing our supply chain's energy and emission footprint, shifting to renewable sources of energy, encouraging our suppliers to set their own SBTs when feasible, and using less carbon-intensive materials in the design phase (such as organic cotton or recycled inputs).While the consumer use of sold products can comprise as much as 26% of emissions, our influence is low (i.e., consumer behaviour drives how clothes are washed and at what frequency) and policies to reduce this may increase emissions from a systems basis (for example, making a garment less durable reduces its use phase emissions but increases other categories).  The Apparel and Footwear Sector Science-based Target Guidance (November 2018 V2.0) has the provision to exclude use of sold products from scope 3 calculations for these reasons.  In accordance with this sector guidance, we are excluding this scope 3 category from the overall calculations to derive the 66% criteria for setting a Science-based target.  Purchased goods & services comprises 81% of all scopes when product use phase is excluded and meets the criteria for scope 3 targets (>66% of all scope 3 categories)."
This is an absolute target for scope 1 & 2 emissions that we have operational control over. This goal started in 2019 after achieving the previous year's goal of 20% absolute emissions reduction. We have reached this goal during the 2020 year. Key factors that contributed to this achievement were the shutdowns due to the global pandemic.
"This is a new absolute target to reduce our scope 2 emissions in El Salvador by 25%. This goal was originally part of a yearly emissions reduction goal of 5% for each facility. After several successful years of reaching the set goal, we have decided to increase the goal and time frame. With the addition of the solar panel arrays to our El Salvador facilities, we believe this is a realistically obtainable goal. To date, we have reached this goal."
"This is a new absolute target to reduce our scope 2 emissions in Honduras by 25%. This goal was originally part of a yearly emissions reduction goal of 5% for each facility. After several successful years of reaching the set goal, we have decided to increase the goal and time frame."
"This is a new goal. We are working toward setting this goal as one of our science based targets. This goal is based on the 2-degree Celsius module outlined by the Science Based Target website, specifically for the apparel division in chapter 3 ""How to set an SBT for Scope 1 and 2 Emissions"". Based on the information given in their guidelines, we believe a goal of 55% absolution emissions reduction from our base year of 2008 to our end target year of 2030 falls in line with the standard linear reduction of 2.5%. Our emissions are calculated using the Greenhouse Gas Protocol manual for Scope 1 and 2 emission."
"This will be our second science based target and covers our Scope 3 emissions. For the apparel/textile industry, we are required to include a Scope 3 emissions reduction target to have our targets recognized as ""science-based"". We started tracking our Scope 3 emissions in 2019 (base year) and the goal we set is 25% reduction by 2030, which will be in line with the 2-degree Celsius criteria outlined by the Science-based Target Apparel manual. As most of our scope 3 emissions are from Purchased and Capital goods/services, our plan for emissions reduction in this category will be based on supplier engagement, with a focus on transitioning to low-carbon technology and energy saving practices."
"Follow the government promulgation of ""Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reduction and Management Law"" in July 2015. In order to complete the 2030 National Independent Contribution (INDC) and the 2050 target- energy consumption intensity targets, corresponding corporate emission reduction targets are formulated to achieve 15% reduction in emissions."
GNI have developed and verified its carbon footprint across the whole organisation. GNI have committed to reducing this by 50% (intensity) across all streams by 2030. We have added an additional 11 items to our carbon footprint database in 2021 for the 2020 reporting timeframe.  GNI completed a materiality assessment of our emission profile and from the results have added 10 items to scope 3 and one additional item to scope 1. GNIs carbon footprint now covers 23 elements of the core business and was considered extremely comprehensive from peer review. We are in the process of developing science based targets with progress being delayed by the development  and publication of industry specific guidance for the oil and gas sector.
"The Oil and Gas Methane Partnership (OGMP) methodology was created by the Climate and Clean Air Coalition in 2014 as a voluntary initiative to help companies reduce methane emissions in the oil and gas sector. Through participation in the OGMP associated reporting, companies were provided with a credible mechanism to systematically and responsibly address their methane emissions, and to demonstrate this systematic approach and its results to stakeholders.GNI have aligned to the following targets around methane emission:• 45% emissions reductions in methane emissions over estimated 2015 levels by 2025;• 60-75% methane emission reductions by 2030; or alternatively• a ‘near zero' emissions intensity, such as the OGCI collective average target for upstream operations of 0.25% by 2025;GNI are in the process of expanding our current methane emission model to transition to OGMP2.0.GNI employ best practice to reduce methane emissions without the requirement to flare gas under normal operating conditions.This is also discussed below but considered in m3 as opposed to TCO2e."
"Gazda? set long-term sustainability targets in 2020 which includes Net Zero Target by 2030.  It is aimed to be Net Zero in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 2030 and across the entire value chain (Scope 1, 2, and 3) by 2040.This target covers all of our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. It is aimed to be Net Zero in Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2030. The baseline emissions are  6,281 tCO2."

"In 2020 GEA had set a long-term target (target year 2050), updated from 2030, to reduce Scope 1 + Scope 2 (market-based) emissions by 52.4%.This target includes the 83 sites, which includes production sites, workshops, and service locations as well as some large offices, including the main headquarters.  In 2020 the absolute target was achieved, above the target of 2.1%, with a reduction in CO2 by 15%. This target includes scope 1 and scope 2 (market based). GEA's operations in 2020 emitted fewer greenhouse gases (Scope 1 and 2). This is due to  GEA's initiatives purchase more green/renewable electricity, with 31 GEA sites in seven countries. In addition, the Covid-19 situation and energy efficiency optimization initiatives at GEA's sites had a positive impact and led to a reduction in emissions of CO2e.  Overall GEA was able to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions in both absolute terms and in relation to revenue. In 2021, GEA has updated this target and set an ambitious Science Based target to reduce Scope 1 & 2 (market based) by 60% by 2030. The target is currently submitted to the SBTi and under the approval process."
"This target includes business travel which includes air travel (global recording by GEA's travel agency), car rentals (rentals in Germany), as well as travel with Deutsche Bahn (bookings in Germany). This means the arithmetic reduction in target year 2050 will be by 52.4% with a yearly reduction of 2,1%.The reduction 2020 was 80.4%, (compared to 2019) which was higher than the target of 2.1% reduction . Business travel was greatly impacted by Covid 19. In 2020, GEA experienced the possibility of online working modes and will continue to encourage this way of working when possible in the future to ensure further CO2 savings.In 2021, GEA has updated this target and set an ambitious Science Based target to reduce Scope 3 (upstream and downstream) by 18% by 2030. The target is currently submitted to the SBTi and under the approval process."
"In 2019 GEA  set a medium-term target (target year 2025) to reduce Scope 1 + Scope 2 (market-based) emissions by 19.1%. The yearly saving rate is improved from 1.5% to 2.1%, starting from 2019. This target includes the 83 sites, which includes production sites, workshops, and service locations as well as some large offices, including the main headquarters. GEA targets to reduce total CO2 emissions by yearly 2.1%. In 2020 the absolute medium term target is on track to be achieved in 2025. This target includes scope 1 and scope 2 (market-based).

In 2021, GEA has updated this target and set an ambitious Science Based target to reduce Scope 1 & 2 (market based) by 60% by 2030. The target is currently submitted to the SBTi and under the approval process."
"In 2019 GEA  set a short-term target (2020/year on year) to reduce Scope 1 + Scope 2 (market-based) emissions by 2.1%. The yearly saving rate is improved from 1.5% to 2.1%, starting from 2019. This target includes the 83 sites, which includes production sites, workshops, and service locations as well as some large offices, including the main headquarters.  In 2020 GEA achieved it's yearly target of continuous reduction of scope 1 and scope 2 (market-based) by 2.1%. GEA's operations in 2020 emitted fewer greenhouse gases (Scope 1 and 2). GEA achieved a CO2 reduction by 13.1% in 2020. This is due to  GEA's initiatives to increase green mix/renewable electricity, with 31 GEA sites in seven countries. In addition, the Covid-19 situation and energy efficiency optimization initiatives at GEA's sites had a positive impact and led to a reduction in emissions of CO2e.  Overall GEA was able to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions in both absolute terms and in relation to revenue. In 2021, GEA has updated this target and set an ambitious Science Based target to reduce Scope 1 & 2 (market based) by 60% by 2030. The target is currently submitted to the SBTi and under the approval process."
"GEA has approved this science-based target in the Global Executive Committee and submission of this SBTi target to the SBTi is on-going and should be validated by 29th July 2021. The SBTi commitment letter has been signed.Due to the requirement of the SBTi, GEA has estimated the emissions of small offices using the CREEM tool to estimate electricity, heat, and GEA fleet (global). Therefore the energy consumption for 2019 has been modified in April 2021 after GEA published its Sustainability Report 2020.GEA is on track to achieve the newly set SBTi target reduction of Scope 1 + Scope 2 (market-based) emissions by 60% by 2030 (base year 2019). In 2021 GEA has increased its yearly target from 2.1% to a yearly average of 5.45%. This target is aligned with SBTi 1.5 degrees.  GEA has achieved a saving of 17.34 % in 2020, well above the required 5.45% yearly reduction.The reasons for this decrease included: GEA's operations in 2020 emitted fewer greenhouse gases (Scope 1 and 2). This is due to  GEA's initiatives purchase more green/renewable electricity, with 31 GEA sites in seven countries. In addition, the Covid-19 situation and energy efficiency optimization initiatives at GEA's sites had a positive impact and led to a reduction in emissions of CO2e.

"In 2019, Genelalong with its joint venture partner and operator of the Tawke PSC, DNO, embarked on the Peshkabir gas  reinjection project. This was the first gas injection project in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. Flaring at Peshkabir constituted over 95% of total emissions associated with the asset and this emission reduction program set to capture, treat and compress the excess gas associated with production at Peshkabir and transport it for injection into the Tawke Cretaceous reservoir to both reduce flaring and simultaneously increase  oil recovery at the Tawke field. The project began in 2019 and was completed in June 2020. Genel's equity share of the total emissions associated with flaring at Peshkabir in 2019 was 119,327 tCO2e. In 2020 the project resulted in a 43% reduction in flaring in 2020 and the total sum of Genel's equity share of emissions at Peshkabir  associated with flaring was 67,524 tCO2e"

In 2020, for continuous improvement, we applied for Science Based targets for our global operations using the absolute contraction method  and received approval from SBTi organization in April 2021.  Energy efficiency in our operations and RE100 will provide the methods to meet our goal in the future.  Our Scope 1 & 2 GHG target includes all of our major operations globally, including our JV operations in China and many leased facilities where GM pays utility bills."
"The targeted carbon emissions in percentage for Scope 2 is established in year 2013 for Resorts World Sentosa premises and do not cover other locations outside of Sentosa.  This is due to the other properties being developed after year 2013. Genting Singapore will review our carbon emissions targets in 2021 to include all locations as well as Scope 1, 2 and 3.As business operations are also impacted by COVID-19 in year 2020, it must be noted that there is a drastic decrease in the carbon emissions due to the drop in activities."
"Net zero carbon emissionsJust over 50% of our emissions relate to non-livestock sources, including emission  of 'fossil' derived carbon fuels for travel, and distribution. These offer absolute reduction opportunity and are targeted accordingly within our zero carbon plans. (which  include transition of our petrol and diesel fleet vehicles to  battery-electric, energy efficiency investment and further development of on-site solar  (PV) generation)Just under 50% of our emissions derive from 'flow' emissions of methane and nitrogen dioxide which start life as atmospheric carbon dioxide, and are taken up by animal-feed crops (corn, soy for example) and fed to our animals. These are then re-emitted to atmosphere through enteric fermentation and manure decomposition throughout the animals life. Whilst it is not possible to reduce livestock related emissions to zero, our strategy will:       * procure crops with lowest carbon and water footprint (*we calculate this using IPPC Agricultural Sector Guidance)       * investigate the inclusion of  animal feed supplements / probiotics which result in reduced levels of enteric emissions       * implement methane (biogas) capture and use of cost-effective treatment / use of this resource in power / heat / fuel production       * provide nutrient inputs to soils, adopting management strategies which minimise volatile losses to atmosphere (or water) and benefit soil biodiversity      *  make use of agricultural lands which we own as a long-term stores of soil carbon (in accordance with measurement criteria contained within The GHG Protocol for Project Accounting)"
"In 2016 we set an absolute energy reduction target of 20% by 2025, comprising electricity and gas consumption and based on 2015 data. At the same time, we implemented enhanced data capture processes to improve the quality of reporting relating to our carbon emissions and energy consumption data. By investing capital in our plants and production processes, we aim to reduce our electricity and gas consumption by focusing on installation of more efficient technology and plat in our operations.Our target includes gas (scope 1) and electricity (scope 2 location based). In 2020, we achieved a reduction of 18.16% in absolute carbon emissions (2020 emissions: 147,340.58 tonnes CO2e) relative to our 2015 baseline (180,038.00 tonnes CO2e), meaning 56.55% of the target has been achieved (180,038 - 147,341) / (180,038 * 0.2) = 90.8%)."

In April 2020 Gestamp received from SBTI the official validation of its reduction targets: Gestamp commits to reduce absolute scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions 30% by 2030 from a 2018 base year. This target covers greenhouse gas emissions from company operations (scopes 1 and 2) and is consistent with reductions required to keep warming to Well-below 2C.To achieve this goal we've started to work in a plan combining the contracting of electricity from renewable sources and the implementation of energy efficiency measures in all of our facilities
"In April 2020 Science Based Target Initiative approved Gestamp's targets: Gestamp commits to reduce absolute scope 3 GHG emissions 22% by 2030 from a 2018 base year. This target covers all operations in our suppl chain and it's consistent with reductions required to keep warming to 2C (please visit  https://sciencebasedtargets.org/companies-taking-action). To achieve this target, we've started to promote some working groups together with our main providers and we're studiyng to set some climate change requirements in the rest of our supply chain that allow us to reduce our scope 3 emissions"
"GETLINK is seen as ""committed"" in the SBTi. and Scope 1+2 target are currently under SBTi validation.  In the frame of the SBTi validation, the Group aimed to have the most robust and verifiable methodology.  This is why 2019 base year has been recently recomputed to ensure a  maintained, referenced and open-sourced data base along with a consistent market-based approach (updated emission factors are extracted from ADEME Carbon and UK Government DBEIS databases).  Please note that it is also a more challenging starting point than using the ''old” 2019 emissions factors that would have created a visible methodology bias in favor of our trajectory. This accounts for the reduction of the emission footprint between old-2019 (57867 tonnes, as per URD2020) and the new 2019 base reference of 46685 tonnes. Since this methodology has been respected for 2020 values,  the publicly disclosed 2020 values have not been changed. There is no target for 2020 since our trajectory is not linear. Target year are 2023 and 2025. 2019 base year emissions value is calculated with recent Emission factors that allows a consistent and like-for-like trajectory towards 2025 targets. 2019 assumptions are described in Environment Plan 2025 under https://www.getlinkgroup.com/en/our-commitments/csr/environmental-responsibility/"

"In 2009, when initiating the ''Green Action Plan”, GIGABYTE set up the first group-wide GHG emission reduction target which was to cut 20% of emissions by 2015 compared to the 2009 level. The target covered scope 1+2 of the GIGABYTE Headquarters, Nanping Factory in Taiwan, and two factories in China. This first goal was achieved in 2012, 3 years ahead of the target year. Therefore, we reset the target to become reducing 40% of absolute GHG emissions by 2020. Again, the revised target was achieved in 2016, 4 years ahead of the target year."
"The target covers scope 1+2 of the GIGABYTE Headquarters, Nanping Factory in Taiwan, and two factories in China. As mentioned above, the first reduction target of the Green Action Plan was reached ahead of the target year. Thus, we reset the goal in 2017 by cutting 50% emissions by 2030 compared to the 2009 level. Considering that the global attention on the extent of business ambition to cut emissions has kept rising, and various related initiatives and standards have been developed by creditable parties, in 2020, GIGABYTE decided to advance the target year from 2030 to 2025. Currently, we are moving on toward the new target, cutting 50% of emissions from the 2009 level by 2025.[Explanation of setting an SBT] GIGABYTE endeavours to reduce our negative impacts on the environment and have made effort to continue cutting the emissions generated from our operation. To ensure our emissions to be in line with or even below the emission level that aims to achieve the global 2°C goals, we tried to set a science-based target based on the methodologies and suggestions provided by SBTi. After researching, we decided to apply the Absolute Contraction Approach which is best applied to our situation to help us understand how much effort we will have to make in the strictest scenario. The result showed that if we continue to keep our emission reduction rate following the current 50% target, it will exceed the 2°C level after 2022. That means we need to either reset a stricter target or set up a new target after 2022. We are still working on this issue."
"This target also covers scope 1+2 of the GIGABYTE Headquarters, Nanping Factory in Taiwan, and two factories in China. Besides the long-term goal, i.e. cutting 50% of the 2009 level by 2025, GIGABYTE also set a rather short-term goal in 2016 to ensure our GHG emission performance continue to be aligned with the reduction path year by year. The short-term goal is called the ''333 Reduction Plan”, which target is to reduce carbon emissions, waste production, and water consumption by 3% each year. So, until the target year 2030, the reduction rate will be around 34.72% compared to the 2016 emission level.[Explanation of setting an SBT] GIGABYTE endeavours to reduce our negative impacts on the environment and have made effort to continue cutting the emissions generated from our operation. To ensure our emissions to be in line with or even below the emission level that aims to achieve the global 2°C goal, we tried to set a science-based target based on the methodologies and suggestions provided by SBTi. After researching, we decided to apply the Absolute Contraction Approach which is best applied to our situation to help us understand how much effort we will have to make in the strictest scenario. The result showed that the emission pathway under the ''333 Reduction Plan” keeps below the expected emission pathway following the requirements of the Absolute Contraction Approach. Therefore, we regard the ''333 Reduction Plan” as a target that could meet the principle of a Science-based target. However, due to a budget issue, currently, we have not submitted the target to SBTi for validation."
"Our approach was primarily based on increasing the share of renewable energies in the total electricity mix of our main production site in Bocholt to 100%. At the end of the reporting year, we already achieved this target as our share of renewable energy stood at 100.0%."
This absolute reduction target covers 100% of our Scopes 1 and 2 and aligns with SBTi's April 2021 criteria for the 1.5 degrees Celsius pathway of ~4.2% linear reduction per year. We have achieved SBTi approval of this target.
This absolute reduction target covers 100% of our Scopes 3 and aligns with SBTi's April 2021 criteria for scope 3 absolute contraction. We have achieved SBTi approval of this target.  Emissions in our supply chain are responsible for >90% of our total scope 3 emissions and are a primary focus for our emissions measurement and reduction strategies.
"Base year emissions covered by target (metric tons CO2e);25.6 . We want to reduce by 10(metric tons CO2e,But in fact we just reduced by 9.3(metric tons CO2e) . So we've done 93% of the emissions.9.3/10*100%=93%"

"In 2019, Givaudan strengthened its targets, now aiming to reduce absolute scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 70% between 2015 and 2030, up from a previous target of a 30% reduction. Our revised target is  1.5°C aligned. In 2020, scope 1 and 2 emissions have reduced by 30% compared to 2015, which means that 43% of the target has been achieved.Target coverage: all scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions."
"Target coverage: all relevant scope 3 categories: Purchased goods and services,  Capital goods, Fuel and energy related activities, Upstream transportation and distribution, Waste generated in operations, Business travel, Employee commuting, Downstream transportation and distribution.During 2020, scope 3 GHG emissions increased by 11% against the 2015 baseline figure. This is mainly due to the development of Givaudan activities which is reflected into the increase of raw material and services used. With a scope 3 modelling using mainly generic emission factors we cannot show reduction except by reducing the activity. This is a key aspect for several project of scope 3 modelling improvement that are on going since 2020."

"In 2020 we developed our long term sustainability strategy: Pure Food + Pure Planet which sets specific targets to 2030. Our Operating Executive established a Group-wide project team to advance target setting on our most material environmental pillars: carbon, water and waste. Leveraging external subject matter expertise including the Carbon Trust, EM3 and Harbor Environmental, we developed an ambitious sustainability strategy supplemented by a deep dive analysis of our current and future state data needs. In January 2021 the Board approved the Pure Food + Pure Planet, strategy which prioritises environmental targets including carbon Scope 1 and 2 targets. 2020  carbon targets on Scope 1 and 2 are part of our SBTi approved targets, aligned to a WB2DS pathway, that are set to 2030 as part of Pure Food +Pure Planet.  Glanbia PLC commits to reduce absolute scope 1 & 2 GHG emissions by 31% by 2030 from a 2018 base year. We have worked with the Carbon Trust  to investigate science based targets to establish a more detailed way of calculating emissions from fuels using the most accurate and local emissions factors across the different geographies  and to link with industry best practices. In order to achieve our Scope 1 and 2 target reduction, we will prioritise renewable energy procurement and an energy efficiency focus, informed by energy audits and a Group Centre of Excellence approach. Glanbia Ireland have also undergone an in depth strategy exercise to inform new emissions target setting, aligned to science based targets and are committed to the SBTi.  The two pronged approach that was adopted is reflective of the ownership and control of our operations."
"This is the last year we will report against this target as it has been retired.

"During FY11, itself management identified the need of mitigating the GHG emissions, we agreed to off-set our emissions by 2020 and to become a carbon neutral company. In line with this vision every year we adopt various project such as clean technologies, low carbon technology, and renewable technology during our budgeting process itself. The emission reduction which we have did is due to clean and energy efficient technology which we have adopted, we have not considered the offset as of now. The emission trend can be seen below.We have signed the intent document and committed for SBTi and have worked on with WWF incubator on developing the roadmap. Now we are in process of defining our targets and action plans to achieve the targets.From our base year, we have reduced 46620 MT of CO2 till FY 21 (Absolute)                               T-CO2, FY11119882FY12119662FY13122562FY14123064FY15103249FY1682166FY1778619FY1885698FY 19   80114FY 20  76,672FY 21  73,262This reduction is in-spite the increase in our production from 1.5 Lakhs tons during our base year  to 1.65 lakhs metric tons in FY21 and even after the impact of COVID 19.We are doing our afforestation project on group level, we will be able to reach our carbon neutrality goals by 2023."
"Scope 1 CO2e was up 16%, however production was up 19%."
"We have a commitment to remain carbon neutral (i.e. net zero carbon emissions) from 2015 onward. This carbon neutrality commitment includes all global facilities within our operational control (i.e. offices, data centers) and business travel emissions within our supply chain. To achieve this commitment, we follow our Carbon Reduction Framework, which includes ambitious targets to implement energy efficiency and procure renewable energy at our facilities. The energy efficiency (10% absolute energy reduction from 2013 to 2020) and renewable energy (100% renewable electricity by 2020) targets are further detailed in C4.2 of this CDP response. Recognizing that these activities alone will not achieve net zero carbon emissions, we invest in certified carbon offsets to achieve the carbon neutrality commitment. It is instructive to note that the 2019 base year emissions provided for Abs1 are the gross market-based emissions (before offsets) within the defined target boundary and consequently the certified offsets purchased are equivalent to these gross emissions. To maximize our transparency to CDP stakeholders, we have reported Abs1 with the understanding that CDP guidance requests that carbon offsets are not reported in C4.1. We have taken this approach as we believe it is an important component of disclosing our progress. Furthermore, we are confident that our reporting of Abs2, Abs3, and energy and renewable energy targets in C4.2 provides CDP with targets that satisfy the reporting guidance as they do not include carbon offsets.We have achieved our carbon neutrality commitment in 2019 through a combination of energy efficient operations and the purchase of renewable electricity and the purchase of carbon offsets."
"Abs2 is the result of two operational commitments, detailed in C4.2 in this CDP response, and includes 100 percent of our Scope 1 and Scope 2 (market-based) emissions. To achieve this commitment, we follow our Carbon Reduction Framework, which includes ambitious targets to implement energy efficiency and renewable energy at our facilities. The reduction during this target period will be achieved through the combination of our energy efficiency (10% absolute energy reduction from 2013 to 2020) and renewable energy (100% renewable electricity by 2020) targets which are further detailed in C4.2 of this CDP response. Achievement of these commitments will far outpace the CDP leadership requirement of 2.1% year-on-year emissions reductions between base year (2013) and target year (2020). We have achieved an 91% reduction in 2019 compared to 2013. This performance is significantly ahead of the 2.1% year-to-year reduction requirement and already exceeds the 15% reduction target by 2020. We are committed to maintaining and exceeding this level of performance in the years to come."
"Abs3 is the result of two operational commitments, detailed in C4.2 in this CDP response, and includes 100 percent of our Scope 1 and Scope 2 (market-based) emissions. To achieve this commitment, we follow our Carbon Reduction Framework, which includes ambitious targets to implement energy efficiency and renewable energy at our facilities. The reduction during this target period will be achieved through the combination of our energy efficiency (10% absolute energy reduction from 2013 to 2020) and renewable energy (100% renewable electricity by 2036) targets which are further detailed in C4.2 of this CDP response. Achievement of these commitments will far outpace the CDP leadership requirement of 2.1% year-on-year emissions reductions between base year (2013) and target year (2036). We have achieved a 95% reduction in 2019 compared to 2013. This performance is significantly ahead of the 2.1% year-to-year reduction requirement and already exceeds the 50% reduction target by 2036.  We are committed to maintaining and exceeding this level of performance in the years to come."
"In March 2021, we announced our commitment to support the goals of the Paris Agreement, which includes aligning our financing activities with a net zero emissions by 2050 pathway, including an accelerated commitment to achieve net zero for our own operations and supply chain by 2030. Across our business operations, we have committed to deepening our performance in key areas such as energy management and direct renewable energy sourcing by 2025, and net zero is the natural next step of our climate journey."
"Scope of Target: Total Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3 mandatory GHG emissions.Achievable through the successful application of the reduction projects identified in C4.3a."
"Scope of Target: Refrigerant, Scope 1Achievable through the application of the education, preventative maintenance and upgrade programmes described in C4.3a."
"Scope of Target: Electricity, Scope 2Achievable through the application of the education and upgrade programmes described in C4.3a."
"Scope of Target: Fleet Vehicle Use, Scope 1 - Petrol and DieselAchievable through the electrification of the company fleet and other initiatives described in C4.3a."
"Se hizo un primer calculo de huella de carbono, alcance 1+2, con datos de 2019, fijando un primer objetivo de reducción de huella de carbono en un 2% para el año 2020. Para ello, se sustituyeron vehículos comerciales incorporando vehículos híbridos no enchufables con un menor consumo de gasoil Respecto a la energía eléctrica que empleamos para el suministro de nuestras instalaciones, ya se está consumiendo con certificado de garantía de origen (GdO) renovable. También se ha procedido  en el ultimo trimestre 2020 al cambio del sistema de iluminación para cambiar las luminarias incandescentes por luminarias LED, con  un menor consumo y mayor eficiencia."
Our target is to reduce Scope 2 by using electricity from renewable sources and thereby reducing the emission factor
"Scope 1 + Scope 2 , we will do scope 3 later this year"
"We have set officially approved and verified science-based targets which are publicly displayed on the Science Based Targets initiative website. You can see Grant Thornton listed on the SBTi website with a validated 1.5C target. This year, energy consumption across all of our offices decreased owing to reduced occupancy during lock down ( as a result of the global pandemic)."
"This is a Scope 3 approved and verified / published science-based target published on the Science Based Targets website aligned to 1.5C trajectory. In 2020, our scope 3 emissions decreased across all offices owing to reduced office occupancy due to the global pandemic. Scope 3 emissions from business travel also decreased significantly owing to the travel restriction imposed to control the spread of COVID-19 (air, rail and road business travel emissions all decreased by between 74-91%)."
"Graphic Packaging reported this target to CDP in 2018 and is reporting progress against the same target in 2020. The 2020 increase in Graphic Packaging's scope 1 + 2 emissions caused the total emissions to exceed the baseline, and as such 0% of the target is currently achieved."
"This target (2013-2025) applies to Scope 1 and 2 emissions for Great-West Lifeco's owner-occupied and investment properties in Canada. The target excludes Scope 1 + 2 GHG emissions associated with corporate jet fuel use, backup generator diesel fuel use, and refrigerants. The target includes emissions associated with our property-level electricity, natural gas, and steam consumption at our corporate head office and investment properties. The reductions achieved to-date (80.7% towards target completion) are in part due to emissions reduction activities (e.g. energy efficiency focused retrofits and behavioral changes) at our corporate head office and investment properties in scope for this target, as well as COVID-19 related closures and travel restrictions in 2020."

"Our approved science-based target commits us to reduce our absolute scope 1 and 2 emissions by 50% by 2030 from a 2018 baseline, as specified by the Small and Medium Enterprises (SME) criteria. The SME criteria was introduced in April 2020 as the only available validation route for non-subsidiary, independent companies with fewer than 500 employees - this was the only route available to us. Our targets was approved by the Science Based Targets initiative and confirmed in-line with a 1.5 degree scenario in November 2020. The scale of the reduction achieved to date is driven largely by the changes in the emission factor for electricity generation, which reduced by 33.7% over the period due to the ongoing decarbonisation of the grid. The scale of the reduction demonstrates why targets to reduce scope 3 emissions are critical to decarbonising our business."
"As part of the development of our 2030 goal to reduce absolute Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions 28 percent over a 2019 baseline we conducted scenario analysis and modeling to determine the feasibility and implications of aligning our target to be consistent with the level of decarbonization required to keep global temperatures to well-below 2-degrees Celsius, 1.5-degrees Celsius, and business-as-usual considering existing business forecasts and energy and emissions reduction plans. We selected these scenarios in alignment with the criteria established by the Science Based Targets Initiative for setting climate targets aligned with climate science."
"Grieg Seafood ASA commits to reduce absolute scope 1, 2, and 3 GHG emissions 35% by 2030 and 100% by 2050 from a 2018 base year. The targets covering greenhouse gas emissions from company operations (scopes 1 and 2) are consistent with reductions required to keep warming to Well-below 2°C."
This target is to reduce absolute 100% of Scope 1 and 2 GHG-emissions by 2050. The base year is 2018 and the target is approved by Science-Based Target initiative.

"We have excluded the Data centers from the target. In the base year, data centers represented 2.4% of the total group emissions. The main reason for excluding them was the fact that they are not reflective of our core activities. We nevertheless still measure their emissions on a yearly basis and are implementing carbon reduction strategies for data centres as well.BPCE is closely following the SBTi's progress with the recommendations for financial institutions to set science based targets.  At the moment, SBT Initiative does not have sector guidance for financial institutions, and targets for financial institutions will not be approved until relevant sector-specific guidance is available for comprehensive target assessments. As BPCE's current target year is 2020, the group is working on setting a new target in line with the current SBTi's recommendations and will keep closely monitoring the progress made in relation to scope 3 recommendations. At this stage, we cannot yet commit to setting an SBT in the next 2 years, as we are also dependent on the progress of the sector recommendations for financial institutions."
"The target coverage was extended to the whole company in 2020 and is at current perimeter (Nature & Découvertes' emissions were included starting 2020).Due to significant improvements on the calculation methods, and therefore corrections to the 2019 carbon footprint, and the inability to revise the 2018 calculations, the base year is no longer 2018 but 2019.  The target was defined in accordance with the recommendations of the ScienceBased Targets (SBT) initiative. The sector-wide approach was thus preferred, based on the tools of the Sectorial Decarbonization Approach (SDA) developed by the International Energy Agency. Due to the lack of 1.5°C scenario data from IEA, SBTi currently does not provide an SDA option for 1.5°C targets, so the Absolute Contraction Approach was also used.The target coverage include emissions related to:-fuel combustion of the ""last mile delivery"" and ""repair services"" fleet (operated by Fnac Darty) -domestic fuel and natural gas combustion Refrigerants gas are not included yet, due to a calculation method under construction. It will be added to the Scope 1 emissions in 2021."

Electricity-related emissions for 2019 were recalculated in accordance with this methodology. Fnac Darty has chosen the market-based method to monitor its performance, in particular its responsible energy purchasing policy. Emissions related to market-based electricity are calculated on the basis of the emission factors provided by the Group's various electricity suppliers. When these are not available, the calculation is based on the supplier's production capacity mix. The consumption associated with each energy source is then multiplied by the emission factors specific to each energy (Base Carbone) corresponding to the emission phase. For European countries and for the recalculation of French emissions in 2019, Fnac Darty calculates market-based emissions based on the residual mix (source AIB), as it was not possible to get the emission factors of the various electricity suppliers in 2019, which changed in 2020. This explains a large part of the decrease between 2019 and 2020. It will be possible to truly monitor the Group's performance on renewable energy purchases in 2021, when the methodology will be identical."

"This target covers properties over which Growthpoint has operational control, based on the CY17 portfolio.  The target excludes properties that were divested or acquired during the performance period (CY17 - CY21) to ensure like-for-like comparison."
"This target was established for the business during 2016, aligned with international climate change action. It states the business' intention to move to net zero emissions by 2050 across all properties over which Growthpoint has operational control. Growthpoint is exploring a number of methodologies currently available to achieve this new aspirational target. As this target is aligned to the goals of the Paris agreement, we consider it to be science based."
"Follow the government promulgation of ""Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reduction and Management Law"" in July 2015. In order to complete the 2030 National Independent Contribution (INDC) and the 2050 target- energy consumption intensity targets, corresponding corporate emission reduction targets are formulated to achieve 15% reduction in emissions."

"The CCR adopted the goal of reducing business units' Scope 1 and 2 (location based) GHG emissions by 30% in relation to base year 2012 considering business units, which together represented on that occasion 80% of revenue. NovaDutra,ViaOeste, RodoNorte, SPVias and AutoBAn business units had the Group's highest revenue and, together, they met this criterion.

"Since July 2015, all electricity consumed by the Group comes from renewable sources. This target is linked to the purchase of renewable electricity with a certified guarantee of origin. In 2020, 89,980GJ of electricity were consumed. In 2020, indirect CO? emissions from the electricity consumed were zero.  To reduce energy consumption and increase energy efficiency, the Group has established  savings measures detailed below: • Insulation measures.• Optimising the operation of heating and ventilation systems.• Optimising lighting on our premises.• Cost-saving measures implemented in our office automation systems.• Installation of smart printers.• Installation of automatons.• Fluorescent and incandescent bulbs swapped for LED technology.• Use of windows with solar filters.• Use of energy efficient equipment.• Optimisation of air conditioning.• Staff awareness about energy savings on our premises.In 2020 the different  actions implemented resulted in energy savings in excess of 798.90 GJ. In addition, the Group implements an EMS in line with ISO 50001 to continue to adapt its facilities and equipment to future regulatory changes and to optimise resources to improve its energy performance (The Group has recently successfully passed an audit to renew the Certification of its EMS according to the ISO 50001  as a sign of the organisation's commitment to Sustainability and Energy Efficiency). The Eco-efficiency Plan ended in 2020, reaching the proposed target of 100% renewable energy (this target was achieved prior to the end of the plan). The Group has drawn up a new Eco-efficiency Plan 2021-2023 which states that the objective is to maintain the 100% renewable energy procurement, therefore it has been revised and the target period has been increased to 2023 also we have renewed our commitment to RE100. We have also recently signed our reduction commitment with the SBTs initiative with the aim of achieving zero net emissions by 2050.  Also In order to reduce electricity consumption, the target set in the eco-efficiency plan is to reduce electricity consumption by 10% per year over the next 3 years. We will therefore set targets for reducing our environmental impact from an operational point of view (actions set out in our Eco-efficiency Plan) and from a business point of view"
"The aim is to reduce the emissions generated by the employee, minimising journeys as far as possible with the technological tools available. In addition, the renewals of the Grupo Cooperativo Cajamar renting vehicles are being replaced by hybrid vehicles. Within the new Eco-efficiency Plan for the next 3 years, new targets have been set to further increase of the entire  Group's vehicle fleet to hybrids. It should also be noted that in 2020 the emission factor corresponding to DEFRA 2020 has been used again, categorising the type of vehicle in our fleet in order to calculate our fleet more accurately.  Since 2014, 119 tonnes of CO2 emissions have been reduced in relation to the Group's fleet of leased vehicles. We have also recently signed our reduction commitment with the SBTs initiative with the aim of achieving zero net emissions by 2050. We will therefore set targets for reducing our environmental impact from an operational point of view  and from a business point of view.It should be noted that the Eco-efficiency Plan ended in 2020, reaching the proposed target of The Group has drawn up a new Eco-efficiency Plan 2021-2023 as a continuation of the previous plan. This document contains the plans for energy saving and efficiency, reduction of the consumption of materials (paper, water and other materials), the measurement of the Group's carbon footprint and the emission offsets. In addition, the new plan sets new objectives to be achieved in the coming years. Also,  the measures set out in the eco-efficiency plan itself, the 2020 results have been accompanied by the conjunctural situation in relation to Covid-19. About the carbon footprint, the Group  and for the third consecutive year offset 100% of the issues of GCC,  1,076 tonnes of CO2 were offset in 2020 by purchasing credits for the Conservation of Madre de Dios project in the Amazon, helping to reduce deforestation in the area, allowing for sustainable forest management and generating benefits for local communities.Finally, for the first time, an Independent Review Report on the Group's Carbon Footprint in accordance with ISAE 3410 assurance in relation to the Group's Carbon Footprint management in accordance with the WRI and World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) Greenhouse Gas Protocol: Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard, Revised Edition."
"In 2016 there was carried out by the first time the calculation of the emission derived from the escape of cooling gases. The measures implemented to achieve the objective consist of upgraded office air-conditioning equipment with R22 refrigerant and on-off control for inverter machines with ecological gas. Note that in relation to total Scope 1 by the reporting year we have achieved a reduction of 389 Ton CO?e. It should be noted that the Eco-efficiency Plan ended in 2020. The Group has drawn up a new Eco-efficiency Plan 2021-2023. Also, in addition to the measures set out in the eco-efficiency plan itself, the 2020 results have been accompanied by the conjunctural situation in relation to Covid-19.  We have also recently signed our reduction commitment with the SBTs initiative with the aim of achieving zero net emissions by 2050. We will therefore set targets for reducing our environmental impact from an operational point of view (actions set out in our Eco-efficiency Plan) and from a business point of view (by committing not to finance companies related to controversial activities and by accompanying our customers in the process of adapting to a low-carbon economy, both through our own financing and through our experimentation centres).About the carbon footprint, the Group  and for the third consecutive year offset 100% of the issues of Grupo Cooperativo Cajamar.  1,076 tonnes of CO2 were offset in 2020 by purchasing credits for the Conservation of Madre de Dios project in the Amazon, helping to reduce deforestation in the area, allowing for sustainable forest management and generating benefits for local communities.Finally, for the first time, an Independent Review Report on the Group's Carbon Footprint in accordance with ISAE 3410 assurance has been prepared by KPMG in relation to the Group's Carbon Footprint management in accordance with the WRI and World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) Greenhouse Gas Protocol: Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard, Revised Edition."
"This long-term target covering Scope 1 and 2 emissions has been added with the aim of continuing to purchase renewable energy in line with Grupo Cooperativo Cajamar's current Eco-efficiency Plan. Since July 2015, all electricity consumed by the Group has come from renewable sources (green energy). This target is linked to the purchase of renewable electricity with certified guarantee of origin and forms part of the RE100 initiative (in relation to Scope 2 emissions). The objective is to reduce by at least 100% ( as a consequence of the Group's 2050 decarbonisation plan detailet in master plan of Grupo Cooperativo Cajamar)  and covers 100% of the Group's Scope 1 and 2 emissions, which include those from direct energy consumption (via the Group's own vehicle fleet with the aim of progressively replacing the Group's vehicle fleet with hybrid vehicles) and especially electricity consumption.  This target meets the 2´1% year on year emission reduction between base year and target year. Although the target of 100% renewable energy procurement is included in our Eco-efficiency Plan (2018-2020) and in the current established Plan (2021-2023) as a continuation of the previous plans; the Group's objective is to maintain 100% renewable energy procurement as well as Scope 1  emission reductions (increasing our vehicle fleet to hybrids)as a sign of our goal towards a decarbonised economy.The Group has recently committed to the SBTs initiative as it is worth noting that the Group's master plan as a roadmap for decarbonisation has established a decarbonisation schedule that includes the setting of emission reduction targets in accordance with the SBTs methodology to which we have recently committed. As a result of our adherence, the Group will define new short, medium and long-term targets to reduce its impact on the environment, both operationally and from a business perspective, with the aim of reaching zero emissions by 2050.  We plan to present and validate the targets in 2022.In terms of carbon footprint, the Group offset 100% of  emissions, making it carbon neutral for the third consecutive year.  In 2020, 1,076 tonnes of CO2 were offset through the purchase of credits for the Madre de Dios Conservation project in the Amazon, helping to reduce deforestation in the area, enabling sustainable forest management and generating benefits for local communities."
"Scope 1 includes refrigerant gases as well as the Group's vehicle fleet. As established in the new Eco-efficiency Plan for the next 3 years, in relation to Scope 1, the objective has been set to continue replacing the renewal of the Grupo Cooperativo Cajamar's leasing vehicles with hybrid vehicles, specifically new objectives have been set to continue increasing the fleet of vehicles throughout the Group to hybrids. This objective complies with the 2.1% annual reduction in emissions between the base year and the target year.  Specifically, the aim is for 64% of the vehicle fleet to be hybrid by 2023 and consequently achieve the emissions reduction target set out in the plan itself. It should also be noted that in 2020 the emission factor corresponding to DEFRA 2020 has been used again, categorising the type of vehicle in our fleet in order to calculate our fleet more accurately.  Since 2016, emissions in relation to the Group's vehicle fleet have been reduced by 118 tonnes.  We have also recently signed our reduction commitment with the SBTs initiative with the aim of achieving zero net emissions by 2050. We will therefore set targets for reducing our environmental impact from an operational point of view  and from a business point of view.It should be noted that the Eco-efficiency Plan ended in 2020, exceeding the target, so the Group has drawn up a new Eco-efficiency Plan 2021-2023 as a continuation of the previous one, which is why the targets have not been registered as new but as a continuation of the previous plan."
"This medium-term target covering Scope  2 emissions has been added with the aim of continuing to purchase renewable energy in line with Group's current Eco-efficiency Plan. Since July 2015, all electricity consumed by the Group has come from renewable sources (green energy). This target is linked to the purchase of renewable electricity with certified guarantee of origin and forms part of the RE100 initiative  to continue to source 100%.  This target meets the 2´1% year on year emission reduction between base year and target year. It should be noted that the target status has been indicated underway because  it is a continuous objective and which has been reinstated in the Group's new 2021-2023 eco-efficiency plan. Although the target of 100% renewable energy procurement is included in our current established Plan (2021-2023) as a continuation of the previous plans the Group's objective is to maintain 100% renewable energy procurement as a sign of our goal towards a decarbonised economy .The Group has recently committed to the SBTs initiative as it is worth noting that the Group's master plan as a roadmap for decarbonisation has established a decarbonisation schedule that includes the setting of emission reduction targets in accordance with the SBTs methodology to which we have recently committed. As a result, the Group will define new short, medium and long-term targets to reduce its impact on the environment, both operationally and from a business perspective, with the aim of reaching zero emissions by 2050.In terms of carbon footprint, the Group offset 100% of Grupo´s emissions, making it carbon neutral.  It should also be noted that in the new eco-efficiency plan, it has been established that 100% of the emissions established in the plan will continue to be offset over the next three years."
"Since 2014, the Group has been calculating indirect emissions in relation to its Scope 3, specifically employee travel by train, car and/or plane.  It should be noted that in 2020, due to the current pandemic situation, work trips have been considerably reduced, so that many of the trips previously made have been replaced by the use of teleworking for preventive reasons. Likewise, despite the current situation, the Group promotes the use of new technologies (videoconferencing) in order to minimise the impact on the environment, as established in the Group's eco-efficiency plan for the next 3 years. In relation to the % reduction in the number of workers commuting by own vehicle, train and plane this plan has established an annual reduction target of 10% for the next 3 years. It should be noted that the target status has been indicated underway because  it is a continuous objective. The Group has recently committed to the SBTs initiative as it is worth noting that the Group's master plan as a roadmap for decarbonisation has established a decarbonisation schedule that includes the setting of emission reduction targets in accordance with the SBTs methodology to which we have recently committed. As a result, the Group will define new short, medium and long-term targets to reduce its impact on the environment, both operationally and from a business perspective, with the aim of reaching zero emissions by 2050."
"The Group has developed a Master Plan as a roadmap for achieving decarbonisation. The Master Plan details a decarbonisation schedule that defines short-, medium- and long-term targets for reducing the impact on the environment from both an operational and business standpoint (such as the target set for reducing emissions in relation to the Group's investments).One of the objectives indicated in the Master Plan is to achieve zero net emissions by 2050. Therefore, as a first step, in 2020, the Group has estimated the emissions of its portfolio, resulting in a total of 15,228,576.56 tonnes of CO2.  Therefore, and in response to the lines set out in the plan itself, the Group has set itself the objective of reducing emissions by 15% by 2030 as a preliminary step to achieving zero emissions in 2050. It should be noted that the target is new as a result of the Master Plan established by the Group and covers the entire portfolio. Also, the Group has recently committed to the Science Based Targets initiative and is progressing in setting targets for its validation."
"The target was set by considering the following:Air conditioning renovation project implemented in some of the buildings of Suramericana Colombia, which has an estimated emission reduction potential of 351.6 tons of carbon dioxide by 2020Projected purchase of I REC certified energy in Suramericana Colombia: By 2020, 60% of purchased energy will be certified. This type of energy will have a lower emission factor. The amount will depend on availability, though the negotiation with the energy supplier allowed us to estimate the above percentage.Solar energy generation in some of the headquarters in Colombia: It is estimated that in 2020, 0.8% of energy consumed in 2017 will be generated from photovoltaic panels (225,453 kWh).LED lighting.The purchase of certified energy was equivalent to the 96% of energy consumption in Suramericana Colombia, this is why the target is already achieved and exceeded in 30%.There is not a methodology available for stablishing science-based targets for the financial sector."
"The submission of the already defined targets will be soon completed, expecting the initiative official respond to our proposal in the coming weeks. However, we have modelized our target using SBTi absolute contraction method and criteria; therefore, we are confident of its upcoming approval.Through this initiative we aim to be aligned with the objective of the Well-below 2C scenario, to limit the increase of global temperature.These science-based targets are aimed at reducing the carbon footprint corresponding to the different operations developed by the Group. Among the many benefits that they entail are: to deepen carbon management; boosting innovation; anticipating legal requirements; strengthening investor confidence; improving profitability and competitive positioning."

"In 2018, the Climate Change Strategy 2030 was designed, with two main objectives and three lines of action, creating the framework for the Group's actions to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, adapt to the impacts of climate change and take advantage of the associated opportunities. The Climate Change Strategy envisages two main objectives: 1. Mitigation: to reduce GHG emissions by 25% by 2030 (compared to 2030), and 2. Adaptation: ensuring the resilience of Elecnor's concession business climate change and achieve position itself as a leading leader in the sector thanks to the opportunities arising from climate change.This target is part of this strategy and remains in place until such time as our target modelled against the SBTi criteria is officially approved."

"Considering our commitment for setting science based targets, our Company presented to the SBTi team its proposed targets based in the methodology C-FACT, publicly disposed by Autodesk. According the scientific methodology in emerging countries a reduction of 50% in 2050 in absolute emissions must be achieved. Therefore our medium and long term targets are adjusted to 14% and 50% of reduction, respectively, accomplishing a 2.1 year-over-year absolute reduction. The base year 2013 was selected for its accuracy and certainty according its coverage (no exclusions) and its complete verification. Please bear in mind the emission figure provided for base year is the one published in the 2015 CDP report, which includes emission figures for 2013 with and adjustment on their electricity emission factor published by SEMARNAT –the Mexican Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources. Both targets are completely focused to support and reach our emissions intensity target per employee (Int1) and our science based target for intensity per revenue (Int2).  The proposed targets (absolute and intensity for S1 and S2) are not validated yet by Science Based Targets Initiative because our lending and investment activities represent more than 5% of our annual revenues (the SBTi threshold for financial institutions' Scope 3 significance). Nevertheless, the methodology for setting SBT's for Scope 3 for financial institutions was launched at the end of 2020 and we will be working on developing and aligning our targets based on this methodology and Net-Zero Banking Alliance guidelines."
"Our new long-term goal was defined based on our joining the Banking Alliance's Net Zero initiative led by the industry and convened by the United Nations. This brings together more than 50 banks from 29 countries in order to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. This supports our importance and ambition that we have to be able to mitigate the environmental impacts of climate change and promote strategies for decarbonization throughout all the Group's aspects.  Moreover, we will be working on developing and aligning our short and mid-term targets based on SBTi methodology for financial institutions and this methodology."
"This target has been defined based on the Science Based Targets initiative and also considers CDP criteria, such as:  - the % of emissions in scope is 70% or higher: 100%. - the target covers both scope 1 and 2 emissions - the target has a medium & long term time frame (2030 & 2050).  - the target meets a 2.1% year-on-year emissions reduction between base year (2013) and target year (2030).  - the total emissions excluded from the boundary (Scope 1+2) are not relevant, estimated at around 2% of Logista's total emissions.Financial year being considered (October 1 - September 30)"

"FS Group's target to be climate neutral by 2050 has been approved by FS's Board of Directors in May 2019. FS Italiane Group aims to become carbon neutral by 2050, for the energy consumed by Group companies that operate in Italy (including rail traction, road transport and consumption in buildings like stations, offices and workshops). Foreign companies, which at the moment cover a minor part of the business, are excluded.The percentage of covered emissions represents, in the base year (2018), the ratio between emissions just from CO2 by companies that operate in Italy (2,210,549 t CO2e), object of the target, and at denominator CO2e emissions from all greenhouse gases by all companies in the reporting boundary (2,755,650 t CO2e). Therefore, the percentage of covered emissions in base year is 80.22%=2,210,549/2,755,650.In 2020, the reporting year, the covered emissions just from CO2 by companies that operate in Italy amounts to 1,580,740 t CO2e.The significant fall in emissions, registered in 2020, is mainly due to the decrease in service operations, because of the restrictions on mobility of people caused by epidemic emergency. The most significant reduction has occurred in rail transport services in Italy, with a decrease of -26% in train-km compared to 2019.The target has not been approved by Science Based Target Initiative, nevertheless, according to the Absolute Emissions Contraction method, the target is considered science-based because in linear terms, the average annual reduction rate of emissions required by the target is 3.33%, which is higher than 2.5%, the annual reduction required by well-below 2°C scenario."
"FS Group has the target to decrease 55% of CO2 emissions by 2030, in comparison to 1990 baseline. In 2020 the CEO of Ferrovie dello Stato has joined the initiative driven by European Corporate Leaders Group (Clg Europe) that has set the target to reduce 55% of carbon emissions by 2030, compared to the 1990 baseline year. The CEO, that has remarked the relevance to be committed in actions to prevent climate change. The CEO has been a signer, together with other european leaders, of a letter addressed to the UE commission to set a more ambitious target in climate change. The target refers to passenger transport operator Trenitalia and to freight transport company Mercitalia Rail, which are equivalent to the baseline perimeter. The emissions considered comes from energy consumed for rail transport as electric and diesel traction. The significant reduction in emissions registered in 2020 is mainly due to the decrease in service operations, because of the restrictions on mobility of people caused by epidemic emergency. The most significant reduction has occurred in rail transport services in Italy, with a decrease of -26% in train-km compared to 2019. The target is not already considered achieved. Nevertheless, FS Group pursues the objective of exceeding the pre-established threshold."

In 2019 we set a 5 year target to reduce emissions by 5% year on year.
"In 2020, the direct global emissions of the Group (Scope 1)  increased by 4.7% overall compared to last year, since a greater consumption of natural gas was recorded during the year. Indirect emissions due to energy (Scope 2) decreased by 9.4%  compared to 2020, thanks to the transition of some plants to  electricity from renewable sources. The intensity of emissions  (Scope 1 and 2) has therefore increased by 1% due to the greater  reduction in the weight of the finished product."
"We finalized our science-based target in CY20, committing to a 50% reduction of absolute Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2030, toward a 1.5-degree trajectory. We've currently achieved a 22% reduction in absolute emissions, having also decreased square footage by 3% from the base year to FY21."

"Guidehouse established a goal in 2020 to reduce our business travel by 9% per year over the next three years per employeefrom our 2019 baseline. This will reduce our largest climate impact for business travel emissions by approximately 25% over the three-year period. As part of this goal, we continue to promote video and teleconferences and public transportation to further reduce the climate impact associated with such travel. In 2021, we have not yet updated our 2020 business travel emissions, but our business travel was dramatically reduced due to the COVID-19 pandemic."

Reduction of emissions by improving loading efficiency.
"H&M group's goal is to have a climate positive value chain by 2040, which means removing more emissions from the atmosphere than that which our value chain emits. Balancing high quality removals to our residual emissions. This target has not formally been approved by the SBTi. However, since it covers all our value chain emissions and it has an ambition level that goes beyond SBTi (to become climate positive) we consider it to be science-based.With the help of expert scientific organizations and the WWF Climate Savers, we have taken a science-based approach to establish three key priorities to help us reach this goal. Priority 1 focuses on leadership in energy efficiency to enable us to use as little energy as possible. Priority 2 tackles our 100% renewable energy goal which will help us to ensure that the energy we use is renewable. Priority 3 targets climate resilience, carbon-sinks, nature-based solutions, regenerative agriculture and relates to emissions in both our own operations and those across our value chain.We are committed to fully eliminating greenhouse gas emissions from our own operations. Despite our best efforts, we recognise that there will still be unavoidable emissions in our value chain. To  become climate positive, we are engaging in activities to absorb emissions both within and beyond our direct control. This involves actively supporting mechanisms that reduce existing emissions while strengthening climate resilience. We need to further develop this approach and collaborate with experts to move solutions forward. We are exploring opportunities in 3 areas: 1. Natural carbon sinks – these are nature's existing mechanisms for absorbing greenhouse gases. This area could include protecting valuable biomass (such as rainforests) or investments in more sustainable agriculture. 2. Technological carbon sinks – these are technological innovations that are designed to absorb existing greenhouse gases and turn them into new products and materials. 3. Reductions outside our value chain. Only accounting for energy efficiency initiatives in the Supply chain, our reduction efforts have contributed to a reduction of 183 296 tonnes of CO2. This represents 1% of total emissions across the value chain.  We will also take into consideration the updated framwork from SBTi and ajust our goals to their net-zero requirements."
"The scope of this target is all our scope 1 & 2 emissions. The main components are use of fuels, refrigerants and electricity in our stores, warehouses and offices. Up to 2017 we have reduced CO2-emissions from our electricity use by 96%, so the remaining climate impact from electricity use are quite limited. The main remaining emissions sources are therefore use of refrigerants and fuels, the latter is mainly use of natural gas in some of our warehouses."
"There is a  target of  5% reduction of the overall energy consumption until 2025, with 2015 as a base year. This was converted into an  according CO2-Target in order to answer this question.There are more efforts to reduce CO2-Emissions, such as choosing low carbon energy sources but for these activities targets have not (yet) been set."
"We follow the India's INDC ""GHG Emission Reduction and Management Law"" in July 2015. in order to complete the 2030 National Independent Contribution  (INDC) and the 2050 target energy consumption intensity targets, corresponding corporate emission reduction targets are formulated to achieve 10% reduction in emission"
It is planned to investigate options for applying science-based target setting methods  to set emissions targets that are consistent with conserving the remaining global emissions budget; particularly it is going to be evaluated to propose targets based on the Science Based Targets initiative.
"In 2020, the Science Based Target Initiative (SBTi) confirmed our commitment to set science-based GHG emission reduction targets. Using the well-below 2°C scenario, we have set a 2035 target to reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions of 40% compared to a 2018 baseline. This target is exclusive of any offsets - nature based or any other form of carbon credits and is still pending SBTi approval. We consider this to be a science-based target as it was calculated using the SBTi tool version 1.2.  We have qualified our target status as underway given that we believe the downturn in the oil and gas industry resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic depressed operations and thus has resulted in significantly lower emissions than would have been anticipated under normal industry conditions.   It is anticipated that the emissions volume will increase in 2021 due to increased activity for 2021 and beyond, however we are implementing many initiatives to ensure our footprint remains on a downward trajectory to the 40% Scope 1 and 2 reduction by 2035.  The data disclosed here is different from that disclosed in our 2020 Annual and Sustainability Report (ASR).  The updates include additional data made available since the release and continued progress made in our data collation and validation processes. These will be reflected in the 2021 ASR data tables."
"We have adopted an absolute, 1.5 degree-aligned emissions reduction target, calculated using the guidance from the Science-based Target Initiative, to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by 42% from 2019/20 levels by 2029/30.Please note that our 2021 emissions have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and may not be representative of a more normalised year."
"We have more target and objectives for the Hamilton Plants. this section covers emissions only, we have targets set for the following1. Hazardous Waste Generation  reduce 30%2. VOC Reduction by    25%3. Recycled Cardboard   100%4. Recycled Metals    100%5. Fuel Blend Hazardous Waste   (100%)6. Land Field Use    30% 7. CO2 Reduction  20% GLOBE"
"Even though SBTi is not applied to setting the group's emission target, Hana Financial Group voluntarily established a carbon neutrality plan with an annual emission reduction target of 2.8 % until 2050 which is more stringent than the target of 2.5 % recommended by SBTi (based on the well-below 2°C alignment). The mid-term target in 2030 is closely linked with the long-term target in 2050."

"HanesBrands set a medium term global corporate goal to reduce absolute CO2e missions by 40% or 161,979 metric tons by 2020 versus its 2007 normalized baseline emissions, which represents an average annual reduction of 3.9% vs. its 2007 baseline year and 7% versus its 2013 start year, both of which are  greater than the 2.1% required by CDP.  As of year-end 2020, the company has achieved over 100% of its 2020 goal. This reduction is the result of significantly increasing use of renewable energy while reducing energy use. At the end of the reporting year, the company's previous set of 2020 broad sustainability goals expired.  During the year, the company engaged with internal and external stakeholders and launched a new goal setting exercise for the coming decade.  As part of the goal-setting exercise the company formally signed the Science Based Targets Call to Action Commitment Letter and began formulating a roadmap to collect necessary data, model scenarios and submit goals for approval.  To date, the company is working through the strategy to formally developed science-based targets as defined by the Science Based Targets initiative and plans to submit targets for approval by year end 2021 or early 2022."
"HanesBrands set a long term global corporate goal to reduce absolute CO2e emissions by 50% or 202,474 metric tons by 2030 versus its 2007 normalized baseline emissions,  which represents an average annual reduction of 3.0% vs. its 2007 baseline year and 9.4% versus its 2013 start year, both of which are  greater than the 2.1% required by CDP.  As of year-end 2020, the company has achieved 114% of its interim, internal 2030 goal. This reduction is the result of significantly increasing use of renewable energy while reducing energy use.

Hankook Tire & Technology newly set an aggressive long-term absolute emissions reduction target to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement – to limit global warming to well-below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and pursue efforts to limit warming to 1.5°C.
"Hannon Armstrong set a target to have zero scope 1 and scope 2 emissions in 2018 and achieved this target. (We have assumed base year emissions as 0.01 TCO2e  as the base year emissions were negligible. We have no direct onsite operations so, scope 1 emissions were zero. Market-based scope 2 emissions were zero due to the purchase of 100% renewable electricity.)"
"We intend to reduce our location-based scope 2 emissions and scope 3 emissions  resulting from purchased goods, business travel, waste emissions and employee commuting. Since we have zero market-based scope 2 emissions, we have set this target to further improve our footprint and enhance our impact towards carbon neutrality."
We have set a target in line with a Science-Based Target trajectory (Well-below 2°C aligned). We have already achieved zero Scope 1 and zero market-based Scope 2 carbon emissions.  We have set this target using scope 1 and location-based scope 2 emissions data and the relevant scope 3 categories that we report on.
"This is a new target; 1 = We are still in the evaluation process. The figures are therefore confidential / not yet publicly dislcosed (hence the ""Intensity figure in target year"" is incorrect). In our Sustainability Strategy 2021-2023, we set ourselves the goal of reducing the CO2 burden of our investment portfolio by at least 10 percent by 2023. In the meantime, we have added another ambitious target to this goal.In the 2020 reporting year, we developed a medium- to long-term climate strategy in capital investment together with other Group units. It was adopted by the Hannover Re Executive Board in spring 2021. The climate strategy is in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement and pursues the approach of reducing the CO2 burden in investments on the one hand and supporting CO2-reducing measures on the other. At the centre is the decarbonisation of our liquid investment portfolio. Our goal is to reduce the CO2 intensity of our self-managed investments from the areas of equities and fixed income by 30 percent by 2025 compared to the base year 2019. This corresponds to an annual average reduction of 7 percent. In the medium term, we also aim to measure and reduce CO2 emissions for illiquid asset classes (e.g. real estate).Our approach is supported by an externally sourced ""carbon risk rating"", which provides us with a comprehensive overview of the carbon footprint of our investment portfolio and helps us to actively manage decarbonisation activities.This target is accompanied by increased investments in sustainable capital investments that counteract climate change or support the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations ( in particular infrastructure investments in renewable energies and clean transport solutions, but also impact investments) as well as increased engagement activities with various stakeholders (such as proxy voting, direct engagement or participation in PRI actions)."
"In 2018, Hansoll Textile has set its CO2 emission reduction to comply with 1.5C goal. Hansoll has used Sectoral Decarbonization Approach developed by the SBTi."
"In order to satisfy the requirements of international initiatives related to the carbon neutrality target and to actively reduce greenhouse gas emissions, Hanwha Solutions has established a 30% reduction target by 2030 compared to 2017 in absolute terms for Scope 1 and 2. We have selected all  business sites as the target scope, and are striving to achieve our targets through activities such as minimizing greenhouse gas emissions from new businesses, using eco-friendly energy, capturing/using CO2, and reducing energy consumption."
"In order to satisfy the requirements of international initiatives related to the carbon neutrality target and to actively reduce greenhouse gas emissions, Hanwha Solutions has established a long-term absolute reduction target by 2050 based on the absolute amount for Scope 1 and 2.

"Harinera de Tardienta is part of a wider company business called Caja Rural de Navarra. As such, we aim to disclose only for Harinera de Tardienta specifically in this CDP as a whole. The absolute targets associated with this activity includes a reduction of 5.48% in 2028 for the emissions in scopes 1 and 2 using 2020 as the base year. This reduction approach towards Harinera de Tardienta´s emissions is a step forward in the realisation of a vision to hopefully achieve a net-zero carbon footprint for 2050. Being present in Spain, and due to the recent incorporation of the national Climate Change and Energy Transition Law (7/2021) following a national 2050 Decarbonisation Strategy, Harinera de Tardienta is aware of the necessity for companies and industries to implement such targets in their company vision and start taking action. Nevertheless, this is the first year for Harinera de Tardienta to calculate its carbon footprint, as such, a conservative but realistic target has been settled for 2028, with the base year attached to its first carbon footprint calculation in 2020. Harinera de Tardienta aims to reduce its carbon footprint even further and approach more aggressive objectives in the near future, however, at the moment, being the first year to disclose, more subtle and progressive objectives have been pursued in order to advance in the correct direction."
Our target covers global Hasbro owned and operated facilities.
Target defined in Q1 2020 ;  Vivendi (therefore Havas) plans to signed its commitment to the SBT initiative in Q3 2020 and submits its target to the Science-Based Targets initiative committee in Q3 2021.  Havas objective of 60% reduction in GHG emissions is more ambitious than
Expected absolute emissions reduction as a result of Hays' Net Zero commitment - see 4.2 below.
Now keeping 2020 as a base year and by the addition of few other GHG sources to the inventory a new target of further 36% reduction in absolute emissions have been set for the year 2030.This is a company wide target for the operation boundary India and limited to Scope 1 & 2 emissions. Financial year 2019 – 20 is used as the basis for the emission inventory as base year.
"1) Due to the expansion of the Huai'an and Mexico plants in 2019 and the adjustment of greenhouse gas emission factors in China, 2019 is set as the  base year.2) Target-setting is set well below the 2 degree scenario3)Target setting includes emissions in scope 1 scope 2 of the enterprise's operational boundaries"
"This target was set during Financial Year 2019-20 (April 2019- March 31, 2020).  The base year is 2019. The target was set considering the year on year trend in emissions and possible growth in the Bank's operations as well as planned interventions for emission reduction.  We have already achieved this target and will be committing to the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) and will set targets in line with the same."
"Our current long-term goal is a 15% reduction in absolute emissions by 2020 compared to our 2011 baseline, with an annual short-term goal of 1-2% each year. Due to the acquisitions and dispositions affecting our portfolio annually on a quarterly basis, this goal is tracked by comparing rolling base year reductions year-over-year for properties within our operational control that we have owned for two full calendar years.  Through the end of 2020, we have achieved a 35% reduction in emissions, surpassing our long-term goal that sunset in 2020.  We achieved an emissions reduction of 6.5% in 2020, also achieving our short-term annual goal, which is to reduce emissions by 1-2% each year.  In addition, in December 2019, we adopted a NEW long-term (15-year) science-based target for Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions reduction of 37.5% by 2033 (against a 2018 baseline year), and Scope 3 GHG emissions reduction target of 18.5%  by 2033 (against a 2018 baseline year).  The science-based targets are publicly disclosed in our 2020 ESG Report as well as the Science Based Targets Initiative's website."
"Our current long-term goal is a 37.5%  reduction in absolute emissions by 2033  compared to a 2018  baseline, with an annual short-term goal of 2.5%  each year (e.g., a 2.5% decrease from 2019 to 2020). Due to the acquisitions and dispositions affecting our portfolio annually on a quarterly basis, this goal is tracked by comparing rolling base year reductions year-over-year for all boundary properties that have been owned for two consecutive calendar years.   Through the end of 2020 , we have achieved an 8.4% cumulative  reduction in emissions, which is 22.4% of our 2033 goal .  We achieved an emissions reduction of 6.5 % in 2020 , also achieving our short-term annual goal.  In addition, in December 2019, we adopted a NEW long-term (15-year) science-based target for Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions reduction of 37.5% by 2033 (against a 2018 baseline year), and Scope 3 GHG emissions reduction target of 18.5%  by 2033 (against a 2018 baseline year).  The science-based targets are publicly disclosed in our 2019 ESG Report as well as the Science Based Targets Initiative's website."
"The targets are set in close consultancy with the Climate Neutral Group (CNG). Becoming carbon neutral is achieved by means of prevention, reduction and compensation of carbon emissions, each with a set target. HMC will begin by investing in carbon offsetting projects that align with its mission to create sustainable value(s). These will be certified carbon reduction projects that are already in development with the accredited Climate Neutral Group. By the end of 2020, HMC has begon offsetting 100% of its existing offshore carbon footprint, equaling roughly 250,000 metric tons of carbon per year. From this starting point, Heerema has set yearly prevention and reduction targets. CNG will officially audit HMC in September 2021 to validate HMC' Carbon Neutral Program against their own CNG Standards.  When the audit results and findings are satisfactory  HMC will become carbon neutral and thus be certified as a Carbon Neutral Contractor."
This is an average year based target.
"Our current target to have fossil-free operations by 2030 relates to our  Scandinavian countries (Sweden, Denmark and Norway). Outcome: In 2020, 90% of all energy consumed in our Scandinavian properties was renewable. Properties where tenants have their own energy contract are not included, because it is not possible for Heimstaden to obtain the energy data in those cases. When the target ""fossil-free operations"" were set in 2019, Heimstaden Bostad only owned properties in Sweden, Norway and Denmark ( except for 1 property  in the Netherlands and 1 in Germany). At the moment our priority is  to extend our reporting in Scope 1 by including fuel used by service cars.In 2020, we have acquired approximately 43000 apartments, but have not recalculated the baseline 2019.During 2020, we have reviewed our climate targets since we have entered countries with more fossil fuel based energy. We have committed to the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) late 2020 and will send our new targets for validation as soon as they are approved by the Board of Directors (decision expected in autumn 2021). The new targets will be the same for the whole Group and cover the entire organisation. The pathway for each country will be different and country tailored."
"The information reported on Scope 3 are related to 2019. We will resubmit accurate 2020 scope 3 data in our CDP 2021 submission. In 2020, COVID has largely impacted our operations and the business of our suppliers. Repeated lockdowns have  been followed by measures against alcohol drinking in some countries. This has created situations where our supply chain activities have been stopped for several months in major markets (Mexico, South Africa)This had a tremendous impact on our emissions mix and we are in the process to revalidate emissions occurred during 2020.In 2019, our emissions went up due to growth in high carbon intensity markets (e.g Nigeria). We did not set a target to decrease scope 3. We are confident that 2021 will show a positive reduction from 2018 baseline as several projects will be implemented."
"The year on year target for improvement of energy consumption in the principal leased assets. We have continued to look into whole building consumption emissions and have investigated setting an appropriate target for both landlord and tenant consumption which will take effect for the next reporting period..Tenant engagement activities and energy efficiency improvements over the reporting period have supported the positive reduction in emission and consumption. Increasing our coverage of smart meters, energy efficient lighting in combination with decarbonisation of the grid have aided our performance.We have set a target which we consider a science based target whereby within the existing portfolio we will seek a 25% reduction in the operational carbon emissions by 2025 compared with a 2019 base year."
"The scope of the target include emissions only for telecom operations in Greece. It is an annual target set in 2019 for 2020. Emissions (under the target) in 2020 were 253,473 t  i.e. a reduction of 22% compared to base year emissions (with a target of 20% reduction)."
"The target covers the operations of OTE Group in Greece. OTE Group, member of the DT Group, is committed to the achievement of the revised, Science Based DT Group-wide targets for the post-2020 period. The target at DT Group level has been approved as science-based and is consistent with the reductions required to keep warming to 1.5ºC. On this basis, the target is considered a science-based target aligned with 1.5ºC. It is noted that on November 9 2020, OTE announced that it has entered into an agreement to sell its 54.01% stake in Telekom Romania Communications S.A. (Fixed) to Orange Romania. All figures have been adjusted to reflect only continuing operations. Telekom Romania operations have been classified as held for sale and have been treated as discontinued operations. As a result, the share of OTE Group Greece emissions to total OTE Group emissions increased to 75% (from 51% in last year's submission)."
Overall emission reduction has been achieved and forecast was reached in 2020. In logistic processes an overall consumption always depends on business developments and number of branches. For logistic service providers the emission always depend on the customer preferences. Influence is limited.
"Compliance with the absolute target will be achieved by avoiding and reducing emissions and the substitution with lower-carbon alternatives in line with location specific possibilities. Measures focus on the consumption of renewable energy, building refurbishments, and the optimization of business travel activities. The reduction target is -10% .Due to a reduction of business travel during the COVID-19 crisis, the targeted absolute emission reduction have been over-achieved."
"Target will be achieved mainly with the increase in separate waste collection, the reduction in the use of landfills for urban waste, the further development of district heating, the use of renewable electricity for internal consumption, and a greater use of low-impact vehicles."
"To reduce the emissions indirectly caused by consumption of electricity, the Hera Group has committed to only use certified renewable energy supply to carry out the business of Hera."
"Target will be achieved mainly with the promotion of energy efficiency in residential customers, the increase in the sale of renewable electricity, and the launch of initiatives to develop hydrogen as an energy vector. Further improvements are expected from exogenous aspects made explicit in the centralized energy scenario developed by Italian institutions taken as a reference for the definition of the targets e.g. the decarbonisation of electricity production, the increase in energy efficiency, and the electrification of energy consumption. Such aspects they will contribute to the achievement of the target relating to indirect greenhouse gas emissions."
"As part of our Earthright strategy launched in 2014 (with a 2013 baseline), we set a goal to reduce our energy intensity by 50%."
"As part of our Earthright strategy launched in 2014 (with a 2013 baseline), we set a goal to reduce our energy intensity by 50%."
"In 2014, as part of our Earthright strategy, we set a goal to be using at least 50% renewable energy from on-site and/or local sources."
"Hermès wanted to make a concrete commitment to the definition of targets for the reduction of its greenhouse gas emissions based on science, which will be validated through the Science-Based Targets (SBTi) initiative that the Group joined in 2020. This commitment will enable the Group to follow a path of reducing its direct and indirect emissions, thereby helping to limit global warming to below 2 °C by 2100. A reduction in absolute value of 50% for scope?1 and 2 emissions over the period 2018 to 2030;  A 50% absolute reduction target of our Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2030 from 2018 levels (4.17% annual linear reduction rate)"
"In FY18, HPE set a Scope 1 and Scope 2 (market-based) reduction goal for FY2018 of 55%. Target coverage is for all facilities within HPE's operational control. This target was approved by SBTi as aligned with a 1.5C trajectory."
"In 2017, HPE established two supply chain emissions reduction goals to achieve by 2025, compared to 2016. We have an overall goal of reducing manufacturing-related GHG emissions (on an absolute basis) in our supply chain by 15% (achieved in 2020) and aim to enable 80% of our manufacturing suppliers (by spend) to set their own science-based emissions reduction target(s)."
"HPE set an upstream transportation and logistics GHG reduction goal consistent with a 1.5 trajectory. We used criteria provided by SBTi to set a target that aligns with a 1.5 trajectory. However, HPE did not submit this goal through SBTi's formal approval process."
"We have set a target to be a net zero carbon business by 2030 and launched our Net Zero Carbon Pathway which is aligned to the UKGBC Paris Proof targets which are based around a 1.5 degree global warming scenario.  Our target of 30% reduction in absolute GHG emissions from a 2019 baseline by 2030 includes our Scope 1 (landlord gas consumption and refrigerant use), Scope 2 (Landlord electricity consumed) and Scope 3 (Capital Goods -embodied carbon of new developments and refurbishments; Downstream Leased Assets - occupier Scope 1 and 2 emissions; Purchased Goods and Services; Fuel and Energy Related Activities; Waste Generated in Operations; Business Travel; and Employee Commuting).  Specifically we are looking at the operational emissions from our buildings and embodied carbon of our development projects. To strengthen our commitment to be a net zero carbon business by 2030 we have decided to sign up to the Better Building Partnership's Climate Commitment and the World Green Building Council's Net Zero Carbon Buildings Commitment."
A meta de redução das emissões do escopo 2 teve início com a instalação de sistema fotovoltaico em maio de 2020.
"In 2020 HFG has committed to setting science-based target through the Science Based Targets initiative and signed the Business Ambition for 1.5°C pledge to net-zero by 2050. The target has been approved in 2021.The requirement on setting science based target on Scope 1 and 2 is that the target should cover at least 95% of company's footprint. In this context, HFG did include all the emissions from its operations in the emissions reduction target."
"The target set on Scope 3 purchased goods and services category, subcategory agricultural products (Agriculture, hunting, forestry and fishing in Quantis) is an absolute target in line with the 2°C pathway.Hilton Food Group Scope 3 represents 99.1% of total emissions based on the Quantis screening results. The purchased goods and services represent 95.6% of the total Scope 3 emissions, and within this category purchased goods from agriculture, hunting, forestry and fishing  is the most significant category and represents 96.28%, meaning 92.04% out of total scope 3 carbon footprint. In this case setting an emissions reduction target on the Agricultural products within Purchased goods and services only is in line with the SBTi Criteria of having a target on at least 2/3rds of Scope 3 emissions sources and at the same time allows us to focus our decarbonisation efforts in the most material category in our supply chain."
"To address our climate footprint the decision was taken to set Science Based Targets for our own operations and our supply chains that will lead to a net zero goal. Therefore, HFG has signed the Business Ambition for 1.5°C pledge to net-zero by 2050. The coverage of the target is 100% since no part of our operations or supply chain can be ignored in the context of achieving net zero emissions."
"HZL committed to reduce company-wide absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions 14% by 2026 from a 2016 base-year. This goal has been approved by the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) and is aligned to well below 2C pathway. The base year 2016 means FY 16-17 and same applies to current year as well. These targets were approved by SBTi in September 2018 for 100% mines and smelters owned by HZL.Our scope 1 + 2 (location based) emissions in FY 20-21 were 4796511 tCO2e, FY 19-20 were 4734643 tCO2e whereas for target setting year (FY18-19) were  4870000 tCO2e. The absolute emissions are on increasing trend since the base year and target setting year- 8.94% higher than in base year 2016, due to expansion activities and increase in production however, there is a reduction by 1.51 % from FY18-19. While we are taking several measures to reduce our carbon emissions, all the initiatives are in the initial stages of implementation. Bulk of the reduction in Scope 1 & Scope 2 will be seen in FY 2022-23 when these projects will be fully implemented. Also, we aim to achieve the SBTi target by investing in Renewable Energy infrastructure progressively by 2026."
"HZL committed to reduce absolute Scope 3 GHG emissions covering (purchased goods (e.g. cement, lime and soda ash, coal and inter-organization transportation of materials); business travel; and upstream and downstream transportation and distribution) 20% by 2026 from a 2016 base-year. The base year 2016 means FY 16-17 and same applies to start year as well. These targets were approved by SBTi in September 2018 for 100% mines and smelters owned by HZL.Our scope 3 emission for FY 20-21 is 4285442 tCO2e, FY 19-20 was 4187597 tCO2e whereas for target setting year FY 18-19 was 4244587 tCO2e.  The absolute Scope 3 emissions have increased by 0.96% from target setting year and by 2.45% from last year, due to increase in production by 7%, and subsequent increase in downstream transportation & distribution, processing of sold goods, and end of life treatment related emissions."
"Due to recent increases in personnel and facilities, Hirose's  metric tons of CO2e did not meet the targeted reduction. Shutdown of the nuclear power plant a few years ago also contributed to difficulty in reducing emissions as much of Japan was forced to rely on higher CO2e emitting forms of energy. Hirose will continue to engage in efforts to decrease emissions and get back on track for next year's target."
"Reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 45% by FY2030 based on FY2010 standard. This target was approved by SBT initiative in May, 2019."

"1.Target Coverage?Target coverage for the base year is Japan only.The Hitachi High-Tech Group has set a target of reducing CO2 emissions from its sites in Japan, which account for 87.4% of energy-related CO2 emissions generated through its business activitiesin Japan and overseas, and 84.6% of the total. (Environmental Action Plan).2.Target year? Since it was established in May 2020, it was set to 2020.3. In order to manage the progress of our CO2 emission reduction activities, we have set a CO2 emission coefficient as a certain value. In order to promote the use of renewable energy inthe future, we will manage it through market-based emission factors.4.Reason for changing the target year: Hitachi, Ltd. declared carbon neutral in 2030.5.The target setting for Scope3 is currently being set."
"The targets have been at a level that will allow us to fulfil the IPCC's RCP2.6 scenario, and these targets are to reduce, through the value chain, CO2 emissions measured against 2010 levels by 50% by 2030, and 80% by 2050. In addition to that, we aim to be carbon neutral by 2030 at our own business sites (factories and offices); we will reduce Scope 1 and 2 emissions 100 % by 2030, and we obtained accreditation of ''Targets for 1.5 degrees Celsius”by the Science Based Targets?SBT?initiative."
"Target: CO2 positive in 2025 (including emissions in scope 1, 2 and 3)"
This target covers all HNI Operations.   The target was a draft in 2019 and was not approved until 2020.  The scope 1 and 2 combined  target was achieved through the purchase of 100% renewable energy credits covering 100% of our global electricity use.

In 15 years' time, emissions are to be reduced by 77%. A key aspect in achieving this target is the introduction of green hydrogen technologies in the metallisation process. A major contribution will be made by switching from blast-furnace production to metallisation and electric arc furnace production, as well as by using renewable and low-carbon energy.The Company's Climate strategy, GHG emissions and its targets were verified by the British Standards Institute (‘BSI')"
"Scope 1 and 2-target: ""We will continue to be below the levels of the Paris Agreement for greenhouse gas emissions for our industry.""The SBT threshold for pulp and paper industry  is 0,4 tCO2/produced ton. Holmen emitted 0,07 tCO2/ton in 2019 entire Holmen Group 1&2 emission included.Covered emissions in base year reported here exceeds the reported value in chapter 6, since it includes emission from Martinsons in 2019, even if Holmen had not purchased Martinson then, and since Scope 2 is calculated using Market based LCA-data.Holmen started transition from fossil energy in the 1980s. We now run an industry whose scope 1&2-emissions are far below the threshold values identified by SBT for the pulp&paper industry. For example in 1980s Hallsta Paper Mill embarked on its transition to run on 100% fossil-free electricity, burning no fuel what so ever at the site today, and in 2005 the Holmen set the target of cutting fossil fuels by 90% by 2020. We managed 88%.Today 80% of our emissions comes from transport to and from our industrial sites, and from input products. Therefore, our new climate targets focus on cutting emissions in these areas. Holmen has signed up to SBTi 1.5degree and our new climate targets are submitted to SBTi for approval. Since our wood products bind CO2 in a long term, Holmen's business is already carbon neutral. Long-term storage of CO2 is also taking place in the soil on the land we own. Also; living biomass store carbon dioxide, and our products substitute fossil intensive materials, thus avoiding fossil CO2-emission. In 2020, Holmen's operations helped to cut the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere by 6.4 million tonnes. This is equivalent to 12% of Sweden's emissions. It is thereby clear that Holmen's  greatest contribution to combat climate change is to replace fossil alternatives. The forest has the greatest climate benefit when wood-based products replace fossil material: the substitution effect. This is the reason Holmen has set more extensive climate objectives then only decreasing Scope 1,2 &3: - Increase our carbon storage above our current figure of +1.8 million tonnes.- Decrease our carbon emissions from our current figure of -0.4 million tonnes in line with the 1.5°C goal of the Paris Agreement.- Increase our carbon substitution above our current figure of +5.0 million tonnes."
"Holmen commits that 60 % of our suppliers by spend, covering input products, will decrease Scope 1,2&3 emissions by 6 % by 2025, Base year set to 2020. For suppliers that meet the target for GHG-emission reduction in line with Paris-agreement 1,5 degree before 2025 we do not demand, but encourage, a continuing reduction.Holmen's largest purchasing categories based on spend within Purchased goods and services are in this order: 1: wood, 2: electricity, 3: transport, 4: input products, 5: purchase of services. CO2 emissions from wood, electricity and transport are already included in Holmen's other climate goals scope 2 and 3, and the purchase of services has very low CO2 emissions. Holmen's climate goal for suppliers is therefore aimed at input products. When we perform LCA analyzes of Holmen's products according to  guidelines given in the publication ''Framework for the development of carbon footprints for paper and board products” (available at www.cepi.org) we include emissions from products from suppliers that deliver ""Non-wood materials that represent on mass basis criteria a value higher or equal to 1% of pulp and paper production"". These suppliers make up 60% of Holmen's spend on input products, and that is why we have chosen to include these in our SBT supplier target. In the autumn of 2020, Holmen's Director Strategic Purchasing and Holmen's Sustainability manager had one - on - one meetings with all these suppliers to discuss how Holmen should best define our new climate goal to support them in their climate work. The majority of suppliers recommended Holmen to set a climate target where suppliers would reduce their Scope 1,2,3 emissions on group level, rather than reduce emissions at the product level, since this would give our suppliers greater freedom to take actions to reduce CO2-emission from their own and our mutual business. This is why Holmen has chosen to formulate our goal the way we have."
"Holmens long term target: ""We will continue to be climate neutral.""Holmen commits to maintain net-zero value chain emissions from scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions by 2050 from a 2019 base-year.In 2019 Holmen's total carbon removals were 656 413 tonne CO2, according to SBT-methodology (explanation below in this text field). This is 14 % more tonnes CO2 than was emitted from Holmen's Scope 1, 2 and 3 in the same year, which was 564 129 tonnes fossil CO2. In year 2050 Holmen commits to still having a total carbon removal that at a minimum equals Holmen's emission in scope 1, 2 and 3 in 2050. Holmen's business contributed to 656 413 tonne CO2 carbon removals in 2019:•soil carbon sequestration of 372 366 tonne CO2 in Holmen's forestland. The calculation is based on the fact that Holmen owns 1 043 000 ha productive forest land and 110 000 ha of forest impediment according to international definition. Please see Holmen's annual report 2019 page 88.•durably storing 284 047 tonne CO2 in harvested wood products (HWP). The calculation is based on the fact that Holmen produced 877 000 m3 wood products in year 2019 (before the Martinsons acquisition). Please see Holmen's annual report 2019 page 88. (If Martinsons entire total production of wood products in 2019 was to be included, the total durably storing in harvested wood products would have equalled 578 121 tonnes of CO2.)These calculations are performed according to United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol."
"Scope of GHG emissionsScope 1 emissions: For example, the Company's delivery of customer services at branches such as the use of refrigerants R407A and R-134A. Fuel combustion resulted from staff travelling to and from project sites. Shipment of goods (diesel and NGV).  Scope 2 emissions: The Company's delivery of customer services at branches such as electricity use.Scope 3 emissions: The Company's distribution of goods such as transporting goods from Distribution Center to branches. Water and LPG consumption in the staff cafeteria."
"This short-term target was created in 2021 and was developed in line with the SBTi's 1.5DS methodology. It has been internally approved by our board. This target will be submitted to the SBTi for approval in the near future and we expect it to be approved. The majority of HomeServe's scope 1 & 2 footprint arises from vehicle fuel (~ 82%), with the remaining contributors being natural gas (~ 8%) and electricity (~10%). Our target is modelled on an absolute contraction approach consistent with the SBTi methodology."
"In order to realize Honda Environmental and Safety Vision and ultimately play a principal role in creating a society with no environmental impact, Honda is committed to tackling climate change, energy, and resource issues through its own technologies and business activities. In response to climate change, we are steadily reducing CO2 emissions by improvement existing technologies. We are also actively introducing renewable energy, aiming for the future elimination of CO2 emissions from our products and business activities. In course, we are steadily reducing CO2 emissions by improvement existing technologies. At present, Honda is currently working to achieve its target of reducing CO2 emissions from motorcycles, automobiles, and power products by 2020, which will reduce CO2 emissions per unit of production worldwide by 30% (compared to 2000 levels). Subsequently, we aim to carbon nutral total corporate emissions by 2050."

"This target focuses on the group's hotels division, commercial properties division, and part of the clubs and services division including The Peak Tramway, Quail Lodge & Golf Club, and Tai Pan Laundry. It accounts for 93% of the group's revenue, including the associated suppliers of these companies, where relevant.  As part of Vision 2020, we have committed to achieving 10% absolute carbon emission reduction compared to the baseline of 2006-08 average. In 2020, we surpassed our absolute carbon emission reduction target, at 40.7% lower than the 2006-08 baseline, mainly due to the slowdown of our businesses globally during the pandemic. Despite the skew in our carbon footprint due to this year's operational challenges, we still observed consistent progress on energy and carbon reduction since the launch of Vision 2020. We were able to meet our carbon target earlier in 2019 prior to the pandemic and we will continue to work on this throughout Vision 2030."
"Hop Lun has set a medium-term goal to reduce GHG emissions intensity with 40% per piece by 2025 (end of financial year) against the baseline year FY19 normalized GHG emissions. By FY21, the company has achieved  54.1% of the FY25 goal, which represents an absolute annual reduction of 2025.92 metric tons CO2e. This reduction is the result of energy efficiency initiatives (e.g. machines with servomotors, energy efficient lights), increased use of renewable energy and improved production efficiency.  The Covid-19 pandemic affected our operations and we used less energy which also decreased GHG emissions. Hop Lun has not yet submitted science-based targets as defined by the science based targets initiative. We consider the existing target to be in line with the SBTi methodology and we aim to have an approved target within the next two years."
"Hormel Foods has a comprehensive goal set related to environmental sustainability, including the implementation of projects to reduce non-renewable energy use and greenhouse gas emissions by 10 percent from the 2011 level by 2020.  The base year has been adjusted for acquisitions and divestitures per WRI GHG Reporting Protocol guidance."

"The target for 2020 was for each entity in Howden to identify and capture it's current emissions for Scope 1 and 2 and certain elements from scope 3 (business travel & waste). 100% of entities complied with the data capture project, enabling us to create the baseline data captured in this report.  We will set reduction  targets in future years to ensure robust progress towards a 50% CO2 reduction from this baseline by 2030. Our Targets are aligned with the UN target to maintain global temperature increase to 1.5 degrees."
"In fiscal 2020, the final year of the medium-term target, the HOYA Group's CO2 emissions amounted to 406,176t-CO2. (Scope 1 and 2 standards) Compared to the base year (FY2014), the CO2 emissions increased by 1.3%, slightly falling short of the target, but on a per-unit basis (sales), the Group was able to reduce CO2 emissions by 9.4%. The HOYA Group has also established a new medium-term (5 years) target for the next five years. A new 5-year target of reducing CO2 emissions by 16% per unit of sales from FY2021 to the end of FY2025, with FY2019 as the base year, and is working to reduce CO2 emissions by setting targets and action plans for each business to achieve the Group's target.Specifically, at our production sites, we are promoting the replacement of equipment with energy-saving types, such as the use of ice thermal storage systems and high-efficiency transformers, energy-saving activities such as optimizing the operating hours of boilers and air conditioners, and rooftop greening. We are also striving to reduce CO2 emissions from non-production sites by introducing light clothing in offices, adjusting room temperatures appropriately, and implementing efficient lighting. At the same time, we are exploring the possibility of increasing the use of renewable energy globally."
"Greenhouse gas emissions from HP operations are primarily due to facility energy use.  Following the acquisition of Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.'s printer business in 2018, HP set a goal to decrease total Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions from global operations (all owned or leased facilities and transportation fleet within our operational control) by 60% by 2025, compared to 2015. This target underwent and passed an official target validation by the Science-Based Targets Initiative (SBTi). The SBTi notified HP of their approval of this target on July 4, 2019.  HP's Scope 3 targets had been previously validated by the SBTi.  This target also follows HP's previously set and met SBTi-approved target of a 25% reduction in absolute Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2025.In 2020, GHG emissions from HP owned or leased facilities and transportation fleet decreased compared to 2015. In 2020, HP's global operations produced 171,000 tonnes of Scope 1 and Scope 2 CO2e emissions, a 20% reduction compared to 2019 and a 56% reduction from our 2015 baseline of 388,700 tonnes of CO2e. After 60% of the time (6 yr/10 yrs), we are 93% of the way towards goal completion (56%/60%).For more information, see p 64-65   of the HP 2020 Sustainable Impact Report online at https://h20195.www2.hp.com/v2/GetDocument.aspx?docname=c07539064. and the HP Carbon Accounting Manual and HP Water Accounting Manual at http://h20195.www2.hp.com/V2/GetDocument.aspx?docname=c05179524 ."
"HSBC's Sustainable Operations Strategy aimed to reduce annual carbon emissions per employee by 1.5 tonne between 2012 and 2020, from 3.5 to 2 tonnes. At the end of 2020, we achieved our carbon emissions, paper, energy and water reduction goals, along with efficiency goals for our buildings and data centres. Though we had achieved some of our goals and made good progress in our environmental footprint reductions already, we acknowledge that the exceptional circumstances caused by the COVID-19 outbreak affected working behaviours which helped drive further environmental reductions in our operations.  Since our baseline of 2011, we have reduced our Scope 1&2 emission (before uplift and scale up*) by an average of 7.0% per year (compounded).* Please refer to our reporting guideline available on https://www.hsbc.com/who-we-are/esg-and-responsible-business/esg-reporting-and-policies"
"HSBC's Sustainable Operations Strategy includes a goal to generate 100% of our energy from renewable sources like wind and solar power.We joined RE100 in Nov 2017. We intend to source 100% of our electricity from renewable sources by 2030, with an interim target of 90% by 2025. Our main strategy has been focused on entering into Power Purchase Agreements (‘PPAs') that bring additional capacity to the local markets. In 2020, 37.4% of our electricity was renewable, mainly due to our power purchase agreements of wind and solar energy in the UK, Mexico and India (PPAs covering 29.8% of our 2020 total consumption.)Since our baseline of 2011, we have reduced our Scope 2 emission (before uplift and scale up*) by an average of 9.4% per year (compounded)."
"In the future (either concurrently or after we achieve our current 10% reduction goal), we intend to set ambitious GHG targets utilizing the Science Based Target Initiative methodology. This could be within the next 2-3 years. In addition, for all environmental metrics, including our GHG target, we apply the operational control boundary, except for our 50/50 joint-venture facility in China, in which we accounted for 100% of our production from that facility. This data represents our largest leased and owned manufacturing and warehouse facilities across the globe, representing approximately 85% of our real estate footprint in terms of square footage. We are in the process of improving our data collection processes to capture all facilities (for example, including offices) so that we may better monitor and provide a more complete picture of our impacts moving forward. We used the methodology outlined in the World Resource Institute (WRI) and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development's (WBCSD) GHG Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (Revised Edition) to calculate the Scope 1 and 2 emissions generated by our facilities. Through this assessment, we measured the GHG emissions associated with the natural gas, propane, and diesel fuels we utilize for heating and cooling our facilities and for our backup generators and forklifts (Scope 1 emissions). In addition, we measured the electricity we purchase to power our facilities (Scope 2 location-based method). GHG emissions are reported in metric tonnes of CO2e (tCO2e). Our energy consumption is limited to natural gas, diesel, propane, hydropower renewable energy, and electricity use."
This target was set in the framework of the EnAW (Energieagentur der Wirtschaft = Energy Agency of the Swiss Private Sector) agreement and covers only Scope 1 emissions from heating in Switzerland. An absolute reduction in emissions between 2013 and 2020 was agreed.
MBU set a target of 1% absolute and intensity reduction for both scope 1 and scope 2 emissions. We did not achieve this reduction in 2020:Scope 1: 1.4% increaseScope 2: 1.2% increaseOverall: 1.4% increase
"In 2019, we set a goal to achieve net zero carbon across all operations by 2025. When the COVID-19 pandemic hit and we realized the impact that our new safety measures -- which required running our HVAC systems longer and harder than ever before -- would have on our energy needs, we decided to accelerate our carbon neutrality efforts in order to decouple our carbon and energy footprints entirely. We achieved this goal in 2020, five years ahead of schedule, by employing a four-part strategy consisting of: (1) energy efficiency, (2) on-site renewables, (2) off-site renewables and renewable energy credits (RECs), and (4) carbon offsets.  Note: In order to align with the fields above, the baseline year (2020) matches the reporting year (2020) to demonstrate that we achieve 100% of the target (net zero carbon in all operations) in the reporting year. Target coverage is segmented by business activity; the target covers all in-service property operations, including Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions that result from natural gas and electricity at in-service office and studio properties.  It excludes upstream development activities as those are considered part of our Scope 3 footprint. While this target has not been assessed by the Science-Based Targets Initiative, we believe it is generally aligned with this concept given it is much more ambitious than the typical Paris-aligned reduction trajectory."
"In 2020, after achieving our net zero carbon target five year ahead of schedule, we committed to the Science-based Targets Initiative and set a target using the streamlined small and medium size enterprise (SME) approach. We selected the more ambitious of two target options -- consistent with reductions required to keep warming to 1.5°C --  and committed to reduce absolute, location-based scope 1 and scope 2 GHG emissions (so excluding RECs and offsets) 50% by 2030 from a 2018 base year, and to measure and reduce our scope 3 emissions. This targets covers 100% of Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions from our in-service office and studio portfolio, and we are committing to measuring and reducing our scope 3 emissions with a particular focus on embodied carbon in our developments and major repositioning projects.Note: In accordance with SBTi and GHG protocol guidance, we re-calculated our 2018 baseline to account for material changes to our portfolio (and resulting emissions), including acquisitions, dispositions, and completed developments that became in-service after the 2018 baseline year. While our absolute GHG emissions dropped significantly in the reporting year -- showing that we are 43% of the way towards achieving our target -- we attribute much of that to reduced physical occupancy in our buildings due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and we anticipate they will increase as tenants reintegrate into the office. Our long-term plan to achieve this target relies on a strategy of gradually reducing our location-based Scope 1 & 2 emissions through continued energy efficiency efforts/project implementation, on-site renewables, and direct procurement of clean power from our local utilities."

"To maintain the momentum achieved by our expired goal, Humana set a new emissions reduction target in 2018.  By the end of 2022, Humana will achieve a 2.1% YOY decrease (cumulative 10.5%) in greenhouse gas emissions from 2017 baseline emissions across our portfolio of owned and leased properties under direct Humana control.  This goal utilizes the suggested annual reduction based on CDP's science-based target methodology.While we exceeded the 2.1 percent YOY reduction in both 2018, 2019, and 2020 we plan to keep this target in place through 2022 to improve on this progress."
"This absolute target is tied to a corporate goal of 10% reduction in Natural Gas usage at our Piscataway, NJ manufacturing location. At the time of setting, it was our largest Scope 1 or 2 emission source. While other sources have increased, this is something we believe will have a significant impact on our emissions inventory. The emission target is based on the 10% activity reduction multiplied by the Natural Gas emission factor. We did not meet the target in 2019 but reset and completed for 2020.Going forward, Humanscale is in the process of finalizing Science Based Targets, which we intend to publish within one year."

"In 2020 we set a new target to reduce absolute CO2 emissions with 35% from entire value chain (scope 1, 2, 3) by 2025. This target was assessed by Science-based targets initiative and approved as being in line with 1.5°C scenario.The target scope has been defined as value chain and we include scope 1 & 2 and part of scope 3 CO2 emissions (product use, suppliers, transportation). Percentage of CO2 emissions in target scope are estimated to be more than 95% from total Scope 1, 2, 3. We have excluded from target scope those scope 3 categories where we have small CO2 impact (e.g. business travel, capital goods, waste generated in operations)."
"This absolute CO2 emissions reduction target was set back in 2016 covering Scope 3 product use phase. Target was set only on Scope 3 product use phase due to the fact that product use phase stand for more than 80% of total Husqvarna Group's Scope 1, 2, 3 CO2 emissions.  In 2017 target was approved by Science-based targets initiative but target ambition was not aligned with any temperature ambition. Science-based targets initiative did not assess target ambition based on temperature in 2017. It was only in 2019 when Science-based targets initiative started to assess target ambition based on the temperature and only then target was assessed as being 2°C aligned. Nevertheless in 2020 we set a new absolute CO2 emissions reduction target that is more ambitious, covering larger scope and in line with 1.5°C. For that reason this target was retired in 2020."
We've  set target emission reduction of 10% in 5 years from 2020.  we will try to achieve the target by multiple method.

Also we have established an internal operational goals based on the internal reduction amount that has been set in accordance with the potential reduction amount by business site. In 2020, the GHG emission trading scheme was introduced for the first time, and we set a mid/long-term goal of reducing emissions at our domestic business sites to the 2018 level by 2025. Since then, we have been implementing RE100 that reflects carbon neutrality based on the 1.5°C scenario by further reinforcing the existing GHG emission reduction target. A roadmap was established for the implementation of RE100 based on the current state of energy use for individual business sites including domestic and overseas production facilities, R&D centers, quality centers, and subsidiaries, and regulatory and social environments were reviewed for each country. We also set mid/long-term targets to reduce emissions by 65% in 2030 and 100% in 2040, and work with other sectors to achieve these targets. Therefore, zero emissions for Scope 2 is set for completion by 2040 and various reduction programs will be implemented until Scope 1 so we can achieve zero emission by 2045. We are also working on the Scope 3 initiatives through supply chain engagement activities."
"To respond to the new climate change system (Post 2020), the government established the ""2030 Framework Roadmap for reducing national GHG emissions,"" and announced Korea's mid- to long-term climate change strategies and specific action plans. Considering the capacity to reduce greenhouse gases by industry sector, the reduction rate (%) of the greenhouse gas by industry sector by 2030 was announced, and the reduction rate of the car industry is 20.5%, based on BAU. HMC sets its absolute target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 45% by 2030 for Scope 1 and 2, not based on the BAU."
"On November 4th, 2016, Paris Agreement, a new climate change system, took effect at the 21st Conference of Parties of the Climatic Change Convention(COP21). Accordingly, the Korean government proposed a 37% reduction in greenhouse gases by 2030 and concluded and announced the ""2030 National Framework Roadmap for GHG Reduction"" as part of its implementation strategy to accomplish (December 2016). According to the roadmap, the reduction target for the domestic sector was 219 million tons by 30 years with a reduction target rate of 20.5 % for the car industry. Hyundai Motor Company has re-settled its stated goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to accomplish the goal of GHG reduction by government mentioned and the goal of the Paris Agreement as representative automobile corporation of Korea. The reference year was established in 2019 to set well-defined target for reducing greenhouse gases, and the target for reducing greenhouse gases was set up to reflect all overseas operations in the scope of management of HMC. HMC plans to actively reduce greenhouse gas emissions by setting a target of 75 percent of reduction (absolute quantity) by 2040 compared to 2019. Based on 2019 emissions, it will reduce total 2,029,037 tCO2 by 2040."
"- Reason for 99% emission from the base year : Since Yesan 1&2, Dangjin Special Steel and Suncheon Forging Plants are either merged or built additionally in the middle of 2015, their GHGs emissions are excluded for the fair comparisons with different years."
"- Reason for emission revision from the base year : In 2020, facilities of Hyundai Green Power which regenerate electricity from one of the by-products in steelmaking process, merged into Dangjin plant of Hyundai Steel as a self-generating waste gas power plant. As a result, GHGs emission is largely increased in 2020, and past emission of the base year 2015 is also adjusted with addition of HGP emission for the fair comparisons with the reporting year. '"

"Among Hyundai Wia's 15 categories of Scope 3, the company set a target for the category of ""use of sold products"" as ""use of sold products"" accounted for 85% of total emissions. The set a target of Scope 3 was set up to reduce by 25% based on absolute quantity by 2030 compared to 2019."
"Iberdrola is commited to reduce absolute Scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions 43% by 2030 from a 2017 base-year. Validated by Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). The target was set in 2019 and revised in 2020."
"Targets for total emissions and basic units are production bases, excluding bases with low energy consumption such as sales bases and offices. The 2 ° C target of the SBTi certification standard before 2019 is consistent, but not the current target of less than 2 ° C and 1.5 ° C."
"ICF set an absolute target of reducing our Scope 1+2 (market-based) emissions by 60% by 2025 compared to our 2013 baseline. As of 2020, we're on track to exceed this target, reducing our Scope 1+2 (market-based) emissions by more than 90% compared to our 2013 baseline. For the remainder of our target period, we will aim to control the growth of our scope 1+2 emissions and continue to purchase RECs for 100% of our electricity use to ensure that we achieve a 60% reduction by 2025. We consider this to be a science-based target based on our use of the Science-Based Targets Initiative's Sector Decarbonization Approach (SDA) tool using the Services / Commercial Buildings sector assumptions. While projecting a 2% annual growth in m2 to 2025, the SDA tool calls for a 38.3% reduction in our Scope 1+2 emissions by 2025 compared to our 2013 baseline. Therefore, we consider that this is a science-based target that significantly exceeds the reductions called for using the SDA methodology. This target equates to a 5% annual linear reduction and aligns with limiting global warming to less than 1.5°C.In line with the requirements of the Science-Based Targets Initiative, ICF has also set a second absolute reduction target for Scope 1 & 2 and an emissions intensity reduction target for Scope 3 using 2018 as a base year."
"ICF has set a combined Scope 1&2 absolute reduction target of 22.5% by 2025 from a 2018 baseline. This is in line with the well below 2 degrees scenario from the Science-Based Targets Initiative tool. ICF began purchasing renewable energy credits in 2015 to reduce our Scope 2 emissions and currently purchases RECs equivalent to 100% of our global electricity use. Therefore, this target introduces additional ambition as it will require even further reductions from our remaining Scope 1 and 2 sources of emissions, including mobile combustion, on-site energy use, and fugitive emissions from refrigerant leakage. Our target was approved by the Science-Based Targets Initiative in 2021."
"In 2013 we have determined our reduction target, aiming for a 25% reduction from the 2008 base emissions until 2020. The target was achieved, however, ICL has decided to set a more ambitious goal and this target was revised in 2021, as part of ICL's a new and updated sustainability vision for 2030. One of the goals included in this ambitious vision is the 30% absolute reduction for total GHG emission (Scope 1+2) from 2018 baseline. ICL has also set a long term goal of Net Zero by 2050. This is in preparation for submitting our target to the SBTi. Note: Some emission figures appearing in this report for previous years differ slightly from past publications of the same figures in CDP and other reports. As part of our constant efforts to improve the accuracy and fullness of our vast and complex GHG inventory, we correct and/or re-baseline our emissions in some necessary cases (most commonly-active correction of identified errors/misunderstands in the internal data gathering process from specific site, retroactive corrections to some specific-ICL emission factors). All such differences are well within the uncertainty range declared in this year's report and the previous ones."

One of the goals included in this ambitious vision is the 3% year-on-year reduction for total GHG emission (Scope 1+2+3) from 2019 and onwards. This has altered the medium and long term goals accordingly, and the company is now aiming for a 25.7% reduction (from the 2008 base emissions) by next year (2020), and for an ultimate 45% reduction (from the 2008 base emissions) by 2030. The main initiatives currently planned to achieve these goals are detailed below.

"We believe that we cannot reduce our energy consumption any more here at our plant in New Jersey,  over the next two years but our  plan for Southeast Asia will hopefully start showing results in offsetting out carbon footprint starting in 2022."
"2 years ago, we had set a target of 3% reduction per year, from 2019 to 2020. But with the continuation of the COVID situation going on (rather than it stopping) we decided to plan for a longer term reduction target, on 5 years.First, we agreed that 2019 should be the base year as the most recent ""normal"" year, with limited impact from COVID.We considered a 5-year period to be preferable to a one year goal, particularly given the disruption caused by the COVID crisis. This is how we decided to have a 25% reduction between 2019 and 2025.Subsequently, we chose to have a third party to measure our full Scope 3 emissions, because thus far we had considered Scope 1 & 2 only and it was clear that our Scope 3 emissions were very likely too significant to be omitted. As can be seen in the numbers, during 2020, emissions went up very slightly (nearly stable though) because our biggest site, in China (Shenzhen) moved its facilities to another plant, and business previously handled by sub-contractors is now happening within the same larger IDEMIA factory. The change in total emissions is really small, one could say that the emissions are flat (from 37831 tons to 38137, that means a change of 0,8%).Considering the fact that the factory in China has grown, and has increased production, then this small increase is an encouraging result, and is a reflection of the environmental impact reduction efforts in all the different sites. Generally speaking, it appears that optimizing factories, changing their throughput, has a real impact on emissions, because bigger machines with better yields contribute to a smaller footprint."
"This target (2013–2020) applies to Scope 1 and 2 emissions in Canada, which includes property-level electricity, natural gas, jet fuel, back-up diesel, and refrigerants consumption at its corporate head office.

"Since 2016, IGT has used an internal web-based tool to collect environmental data from sites all over the world. The tool has systemized and harmonized the data collection process, giving a more comprehensive overview of the Company's environmental impacts. During last years improvements were made to the tool, which allowed IGT to  increase the number of small sites reporting on their environmental performance in a full boundary coverage perspective. During last year therefore, thanks to the committment of reducing the emissions, as well as due to covid impact on global economy, the total Scope 1+2 emissions decreased by more than 17%."
We have set long-term targets of 50% reduction of total green house gas emissions from ships by 2050 (compared to 2008) in new mid-term management plan.  The performing ships' deadweight  in FY 2021 was about 50% more than that in FY 2008 (Base Year) as brand-new large ships have been delivered in FY 2021.  Therefore total amount of CO2 emissions is more than that of Base Year.
Korea's emission permit certification goals
"Our emission reduction target was based using the Science Based Target initiatives absolute contraction tool. The methodology applies a well below 2°C scenario developed by International Energy Agency (IEA) as part of its publication, Energy Technology Perspectives (ETP). It was developed by CDP, WRI and WWF with the technical support of Ecofys, a consultancy partner. The methodology was created with input from a group of technical advisors, two public stakeholder workshops and one online workshop, and aims to provide businesses with a research-backed method to set their emissions goals. The accompanying tool allows companies to enter their data and determine their science-based targets according to the method and is regularly updated with recent ETP data. Our carbon target provides us with a long-term perspective to 2030 based on input with our 2019 Scope 1 and 2 emissions baseline."
"Our emission reduction target was created using the Science Based Target initiatives methodology of 1.5°C which equated to reducing our Scope 3 emissions by 4.2% annually. Scope 3 emissions associated with employee commuting and business travel decreased due to changes in operations resulting from COVID-19 including a large portion of our workforce working remotely and a decrease in business travel in respondence to the global pandemic. These reductions in emissions were offset by an increase in production and an increase in emissions resulting from purchased goods and services, as well as capital goods."

"In 2019 Impax put in place the target to source 100% of its electricity consumed globally from renewable sources by 2030. This target aims to effectively result in a 100% reduction in Impax's market-based Scope 2 emissions. As of 31 December 2020, this stood at 62% across the Company; representing the share from Impax's London office which purchases 100% certified renewable electricity. Our Portsmouth, NH office has also made the switch to entirely renewably sourced electricity in effect from January 1st 2021, taking Impax wide sourcing of electricity from renewable sources to 98%. This will be reflected in our reporting for CY2021. This objective is harder to achieve in Hong Kong and we are currently exploring options to achieve our target for this location. We consider this a science-based target since according to the SBTi, targets to actively source renewable electricity at a rate that is consistent with 1.5°C scenarios are an acceptable alternative to [science-based] scope 2 emission reduction targets. The SBTi has identified 100% renewable electricity procurement by 2030 as thresholds for this approach in line with the recommendations of RE100.Please see: https://sciencebasedtargets.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SBTi-criteria.pdf"
"2020 Target was set pre-pandemic; as we only traded 'normally' for less than one quarter before largely working from home, this produced a highly skewed reporting figure for this year far in excess of targeted reductions. As we will not be returning to the same levels of  emission generating activity post pandemic, through continued working from home into 2021 and revisions currently being made to move to a hybrid office/home working model, the targets will be substantively revised for 2021 and onwards. Whilst we shall still be using 2019 emissions as our base reporting year, reductions for the next three years will bemuch more aggresively targeted as we seek to reduce our property footprint, restrict business travel and move to renewable energy sources as part of our PAS2060 carbon neutrality ambition for the end of 2022.  These new reductions are due to be published in Septmber 2021 and will be shared with all stakeholders."

"This is applicable to the Scope 1 and 2 emissions of all our operations. This is an annual target. It was exceeded with a reduction of 12% being achieved between the 2019 and 2020 reporting years. This reduction is in part due to the impact of COVID-19 which resulted in reduced activity. However, some of the reduction was also realised from implemented energy efficiency and renewable energy projects.   We have recently set a new target for 2030.  The alignment of the target with science is being assessed."

"During 2020 IPL set a global Scope 1+2 absolute GHG reduction target of 5% by 2026 against our 2020 baseline.  This is supported by our commitment to the investigation, identification and implementation of one or more projects to reduce our global emissions by 200,000 tCO2e which is equal to ~5% of our global 2020 emissions. IPL's total global 2020 emissions were 3,616,740 tCO2e. The 2020 GHG baseline is subject to adjustment due to unforeseen future expansions and acquisitions or divestments which may occur before the end of the 2026 IPL financial year. We have reported we do not expect to set a SBT in the next two years. This is because the SBTi methodology for the chemical sector is still in development and therefore currently not available for use under the sectoral decarbonisation approach. IPL will consider the setting of a SBT once the methodology is released for use."

"As indicated in the Sustainability Report (which is publicly available) and in the Sustainability Master Plan, some of the commitments established by the company include improving the management of its carbon footprint, as well as reducing emissions in different time horizons between 2019-2040. In 2020, Indra fixed a new absolute target at Company level based on the emissions savings expected to be achieved through a number of emission reduction activities to be implemented within a 11 year timeframe. The target established, which has a scope covering Scope 1+2 (market based), was a reduction of 50% of the emissions for 2030, which translates to a 6.1% annual reduction rate. The targets covering greenhouse gas emissions from company operations (scopes 1 and 2) are consistent with reductions required to keep warming to 1.5°C (SBTi).In 2020, Indra's carbon footprint decreased due to COVID-19 pandemic impact. In 2020, most of workplaces of Indra were closed because of health reasons and our employees were working remotely. Therefore, the significant reduction was produced mainly by external and uncontrollable facts. However, this situation has accelerated the implementation of certain policies of the company: nowadays several units of the company (e.g. Human Resources or Finances) are analysing more ambitious scenarios of remote work; and a more challenging travel policy to reduce both travel costs and emissions from business travels has also been developed."

"Indra's long-term target submission for  scope 3 emissions is a reduction of absolute emissions 50% from a 2019 base year to a 2040 target year; additionally, Scope 3 target has been assessed through the SBTi's  target validation process, although they are not currently classified.The timeframe ambition (from base year to target year) of Indra's proposed scope 3 target meets the minimum ambition under the Absolute Contraction approach, and is therefore considered ambitious.Abs 6 target is more ambitious (well below 2ºC) than Abs 5 target (2ºC aligned) because we consider that the technologis and advances needed to reduce the emissions of our Scope 3 (purchasing of goods and services and transportation - business travels and commuting) will advance more rapidly in the long-term than in the mid-term."
"This target has been achieved in the reporting year, in 2020. Partially, this target has been achieved thanks to the effect of the pandemic in Indra's emissions and also to the methodology change explained in question 5.1. Additionally, this target has been replaced by the target ""Abs 3"", which is a Science Based Target."
"This target expired in 2020. However, this target was achieved in 2020, among others, thanks to the impact of the pandemic and the change of methodology explained in question 5.1,"
"These figures are based on the financial year.  IBK has been managing greenhouse gas emissions to respond to government environmental regulations. However, this is not a target management method based on past emissions, but a target management method based on future projected emissions. Therefore, IBK is additionally operating a target management method based on past emissions. The reason IBK target to be science-based is that this tool is based on NDC in Korea which uses  science-based tool. Based on the contents that have been managed since 2012, IBK set the target in 2016 and  final emission goal is 52,467  until 2030. This is IBK's own voluntary reduction goal. It is a stronger target than the reduction target of the government's greenhouse gas and energy target management scheme. Also it is based on 2.1% year-on-year reduction."

"In 2018, we set a science-based target (which was approved by the Science-Based Targets Initiative in 2019) to reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 50% by 2030 from a 2017 base year. Our base year data includes emissions from UBM Plc which was acquired by Informa in June 2018. UBM Plc previously had a separate science-based target which we included in our 2019 submission to CDP and which was superseded by this one.Our target along with our scope 3 target (see below) is consistent with reductions required to keep global warming to well below 2C. This year, we updated our target reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 55% by 2030 from a 2017 base year. The updated target is consistent with reductions required to keep global warming to below 1.5C.Our scope 1&2 target has been achieved ahead of schedule thanks to significant reductions in our office estate, investments in energy efficiency, self generation and the purchase of energy attribute certificates for 97% of our offices in 2020. This resulted in a significant reduction of our market-based emissions."

"The goal has been set to reduce our fugitive methane emissions to 50% from our 2019 baseline by 2030. In 2020 these emissions represented 4.1% of IEnova's total GHG emissions. Although it does not represent a large amount for the total emissions of IEnova, this type of emission must be attended to adress a Mexican regulation that establishes the implementation of a plan to control and reduce methane emissions in the oil and gas sector for the country.The goal will be achieved primarily through  improving the efficiency of the pipelines segment which results in the reduction of fugitive methane emissions; and by improving fugitive emission review, detection, and repairing activities as part of the assets maintenance plan. We consider that we are going to reduce at least 6% per year starting with emissions from 2021  . The reduction will begin to be measured in 2021, mainly due to the fact that COVID did not allow us to directly measure in the field the reduction that could have occurred in 2020.We will report progress toward this new goal beginning in next year's sustainability report."
Ingenico Group aims to reduce CO2 emissions related to offices occupied by Ingenico Group. It needs to increase the energy efficiency of buildings and also the share of renewable energy supplying the sites especially located in Sweden Germany and France.

"We have updated our target to ensure they are aligned with the latest climate science and in line with the UK's commitment under the UN Paris Agreement, thereby contributing to the global effort to prevent the worst consequences of climate change. This target, although not approved by the Science Based Targets Initiative, is aligned with the reductions required to maintain global temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Please note that the % of target achieved appears minimal due to a restatement of the 2018 emissions which is not reflected in the 2018 baseline used for this target. The 2020 emissions total is therefore the most accurate figure and it will be used to set an official science-based target later this year which will also include Scope 3 emissions."
It is the electricity consumption absolute reduction target for Taiwan site.  This long-term target is annual average electricity conservation ?1% over 2020-2025.
"Innolux continues to work with suppliers to reduce the product GHG emissions allocation to us. In 2020, Innolux inventoried suppliers of top 90% by transaction amount of their company GHG emissions in 2019. The reduction allocated to Innolux was 138,746 tCO2e. In 2021, we will introduce the ''Supplier Carbon Reduction Inventory 3-Year Plan” on suppliers with an accumulative procurement of 91% to constantly guide suppliers to adopt the low-carbon value chain."
"As part of our 2016 to 2020 Sustainability Strategy, Innophos developed the 2020 and 2030 science-based goals to reduce absolute greenhouse gas emissions by 25% and 50%, respectively, compared to 2010"
"Climate change is becoming increasingly important to internal and external stakeholders. In response to this, Innospec set and met the 2020 objective and target  of securing 100% renewable electricity contracts at its manufacturing facilities or where not possible offsetting emissions associated with electricity usage.  This resulted in Innospec's scope 2 emissions being zero.   As such, a decision was made in 2020 to focus the 2021 objective on scope 1 emission reduction and include a long term target of 2030.   The agreed objective for 2021 is to reduce the group scope 1 emissions by 10% by the end of 2030."
"The target includes offsets. The offsets include renewable energy reduction contributions and CO2 absorption through forest conservation. The amount of contribution from renewable energy is calculated based on the ""Guidelines for Measurement, Reporting and Verification of GHG Emission Reductions in JBIC's GREEN"" (the ''J-MRV Guidelines”)."
"Inscape conducted some initiatives in 2015-2019 to reduce the energy consumption. while Inscape has achieved its planned target to reduce the energy consumption, meantime Inscape is working to identify other opportunities to maintain it while expanding its business with higher revenue target. in 2019/2020  we have done some insulation works to prevent loss if energy. In 2020 because of decline of production, energy usage and carbon footprint also  declined."
"IAG's Climate Action Plan and Scorecard (https://www.iag.com.au/safer-communities/our-climate-action-plan) has a focus area to ‘Reduce Our Emissions'. IAG's targets are outlined in objective 3.1 ''Manage our own impacts in line with a transition to a low carbon future” and activity 3.1.1 ''Meet IAG's science-based emission targets for scope 1 and 2 emissions”.  In 2018 we set new science-based targets to keep our emissions in line with our view to limit climate change to no more than 2°C from pre-industrial levels. Based on the models suitable for our business, our targets cover our scope 1 and 2 emissions, which in the 2018 financial year were 34,198 tonnes CO2e.Using FY18 as its baseline year, IAG set science-based absolute emissions reduction targets for its Group Scope 1 & 2 emissions to meet its Paris Agreement commitments to keep climate change below 2°C. These absolute targets for Scope 1 & 2 emissions include a 20% reduction by 2020, 43% reduction by 2025, 71% reduction by 2030 and a 95% reduction by 2050. IAG's progress towards these science-based absolute emissions reduction targets can be found on our Climate-related disclosure, page 22: https://www.iag.com.au/sites/default/files/Documents/Safer%20Communities/FY20-Climate-related-disclosure.pdfIn FY20 IAG reduced Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions to 21,278, meeting its 2020 targets for absolute reductions. While a reduction in emissions from operational energy and transport-related activities can be attributed to COVID-19 restrictions, IAG's activities in consolidation of its property portfolio, transitioning key offices to activity-based working, implementation of energy efficiency activities and the increasing fuel efficiency of fleet vehicles continued to drive down scope 1 and 2 emissions."

Our number is based on data from our Electric utility company.
Control and monitoring over utility usage combined with strategies for lighting  and servicing of key equipment have impacted on our overall reduction target.
"Our target is focused on further reducing Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 10% on an absolute basis by 2030 from 2019 levels. Through the end of 2020, we maintained Scope 1 and 2 emissions roughly flat to the 2019 baseline, even with significant manufacturing growth. We have tracked our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions over the past two decades against a science-based reduction target of 80% from 2000 levels by 2050. In recent years, our absolute GHG emissions have increased due to significant growth and increased manufacturing complexity, but our GHG emissions on a production unit basis have decreased significantly. Since 2000, our Scope 1 and 2 emissions have decreased by about 28% on an absolute basis, even as we expanded our manufacturing capacity approximately 3x. We are committed to driving further reductions through our 2030 sustainability (RISE) strategy and goals, as well as through collaboration with others in the semiconductor and other manufacturing industries.We track our GHG emissions against science-based carbon targets and our 2030 GHG goal is informed by climate science. However, due to our (and our industry's) early actions to reduce absolute emissions, it remains challenging to set a target using a more recent baseline year, under the existing methodology of the Science-Based Targets Initiative. In 2020, we began working with industry stakeholders to assess the potential for development of a sector-specific approach to setting science-based GHG emissions reduction targets for the semiconductor manufacturing industry and to account for the climate benefits our technology provides. The goal is to develop an industry-specific guidance or target-setting standard to ultimately expand the number of companies in our sector that set science-based targets. In 2021, we will continue to take action on emissions reduction strategies focused on emissions abatement, continued investments in renewable electricity, process and equipment optimization, and energy conservation."
"We recognise the risks from climate change and the importance of reducing our carbon footprint and in 2020 have published our 2030 carbon reduction targets, approved by the Science Based Targets initiative. During 2020, due mainly to the impacts of Covid-19 on our industry, our absolute Scope 1, 2 and 3 (FERA) GHG emissions from our owned, leased and managed hotels fell by 23%, from a 2018 base year (against a 2030 reduction target of 15%), and our Scope 3 GHG emissions from our franchised hotels fell by 18% per square metre, from a 2018 base year (against a 2030 reduction target of 46% per square meter). Covid-19 has significantly impacted occupancy levels across our estate and required intermittent hotel closures in many locations, which in turn has significantly lowered our carbon footprint  for the year. As the industry recovers, we will continue to focus on achieving our carbon reduction goals by driving energy efficiency in our hotels and increasingly looking at renewable energy solutions.We report Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 emissions as defined by the GHG protocol: • Scope 1 emissions are direct emissions from the burning of fuels or from refrigerant losses by the emitter.• Scope 2 emissions are indirect emissions generated by the energy purchased or acquired by the emitter.• Scope 3 emissions are indirect emissions that occur in a company's value chain."
"Our base year is 2018/19. We have used science-based target setting tools to calculate a target in line with less than 1.5 degrees of global warming (i.e. more ambitious than the SBTi tool required for 1.5 degrees) to reduce our scope 1 + 2 emissions by 2030 by 80% using the market-based Scope 2 accounting approach.Current emissions reductions have ICG exceeding the 80% reduction target. Predominantly, due to the impact of COVID-19 resulting in lockdowns and travel restrictions, as it has had significant impact in building utilisation and energy related emissions as well as business related travel emissions. We expect some increase in emissions in 2021/22 as restrictions ease and we return the utilisation of our operational infrastructure to normal. With this in mind we consider ours progress as still 'underway' in achieving our emissions reduction target."
"IBM's target was developed based on the scientific recommendations of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). However, we did not pursue ""approval"" of our goal by the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi) or other third party entity given the basis for our goal development.IBM's GHG emissions reduction goal in effect during 2020 was to reduce CO2 emissions associated with IBM's energy consumption 40% by 2025 against the 2005 baseline, adjusted for divestitures and acquisitions (upon meeting this goal IBM established a new goal in February 2021. See more below). The target covered IBM's Scope 1 emissions from fuel combustion from stationary sources, Scope 2 emissions (market-based) associated with IBM's use of electricity, steam, heating and cooling, and emissions associated with the electricity IBM consumes at its data centers located in third party managed facilities (known as co-location data centers), reported as Scope 3 emissions of ""Purchased goods and services"".IBM reduced CO2 emissions 56.6% between 2005 and 2020, reflecting an annual reduction rate of 3.8% and exceeding the scientific recommendations of IPCC which calls for a global reduction of emissions of 45% by 2030 against the 2010 baseline (or 2.3% per year) to limit global temperature increases to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. We met our goal five years early.  In February 2021, IBM announced its fifth-generation emissions reduction goal which is to reduce GHG emissions 65% by 2025 against our 2010 baseline, adjusted for acquisitions and divestitures. We also set a new target to reach net zero GHG emissions by 2030. More information about these goals can be found here:https://newsroom.ibm.com/2021-02-16-IBM-Commits-To-Net-Zero-Greenhouse-Gas-Emissions-By-2030?lnk=hpv18nf1"
"in 2019, IAG committed to net zero Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2050 and published a quantified 30-year roadmap for delivering on short, medium and long-term climate targets. Key initiatives include renewing our fleet of planes, making operational efficiency improvements, expanding our use of sustainable aviation fuels (SAF), and investing in carbon offsets and removals. We regularly review this roadmap to account for new developments. Based on the 2020 version, 45% of reductions in 2050 are expected to come from new aircraft and operations, 25% of reductions from SAF, and 30% from greenhouse gas (GHG) removals. IAG currently expects gross emissions to halve between 2019 and 2050, including the contribution of sustainable aviation fuel. We are also working to increase the pace of technology development for low carbon aircraft and sustainable fuels, by advocating for supportive government policy, and if this progress accelerates, we will deliver more reductions in-sector, and will rely less on carbon offsets and removals to met our goals.IAG will not be using offsets to meet its net zero climate goal in 2050. IAG will neutralize the impact of any residual emissions by permanently removing an equivalent amount of CO2 from the atmosphere. IAG is advocating for the global scaling up of high-quality removals solutions via membership of the Coalition for Negative Emissions (See Section C12).Gross Scope 1 and 2 emissions were 30,764,602 tonnes of CO2e in 2019. 2020 emissions were significantly reduced to COVID-19 - 10,991,811 tonnes CO2e - and will rise again in the short term as demand for flying recovers. However, IAG remains committed to its 2025, 2030 and 2050 goals.IAG is committed to climate-aligned decarbonisation pathways and was the first airline group to sign the UN Business Ambition for 1.5 degree pledge, in December 2019. In 2020, IAG joined the SBTi Aviation Technical Working Group to define criteria for well-below-2C interim targets for aviation. However, the SBTi has not yet completed this work, so no airline can have their targets validated. At the time of writing, SBTi draft guidance is that a 65% reduction in emissions intensity is required by 2050 to align with a ""well-below-2C"" pathway. Based on our CO2 Roadmap, IAG achieves a 70% drop in intensity so exceeds this. Our 2050 net outcome is aligned to 1.5C."
"As part of our 2019 net zero by 2050 commitment, IAG published and regularly reviews a 30-year roadmap for delivering on short, medium and long-term climate targets.  In 2019, IAG also committed to reducing net emissions from 27MT down to 22 MT CO2 by 2030. This target covers Scope 1 and 2 CO2 emissions and equates to a 20% reduction between 2019-2030. Gross Scope 1 and 2 emissions were 30,764,602 tonnes of CO2e in 2019. Due to fleet efficiency improvements and IAG's commitment to a million tonnes of SAF by 2030, we currently expect a 10% reduction in gross emissions between 2019-2030 - but this is illustrative and we will regularly review our roadmap and the contribution of fleet modernisation, operational efficiency and SAF. With advances in technology and policy support, we will be able to drive greater reductions in our value chain and rely less on offsets and removals to meet our 20% net target by 2030.  Aviation is a hard-to-abate sector, with limited options to decarbonise, and we are laying the groundwork now for faster decarbonisation in the 2030s and 2040s. 2020 emissions were significantly reduced to COVID-19 and will rise again in the short term as demand for flying recovers. However, IAG remains committed to its 2025, 2030 and 2050 goals.Our 2050 net zero outcome is aligned to what UN IPCC science deems necessary to limit global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. In 2019, IAG was the first airline group to sign the UN Business Ambition for 1.5 degree pledge, and in 2020 joined the SBTi aviation Technical Working Group to help to define well-below-2C and 1.5C aligned interim targets for aviation. The SBTi has not yet completed their work, so no airline can yet have their targets validated."
"For further information, in 2021, IAG was the first airline group worldwide to commit to net zero Scope 3 emissions by 2050. Because these emissions reductions will occur in our supply chain, we are still working to establish what share of reductions are expected to be gross reductions versus net reductions. The 100% gross reduction above is illustrative, and is a maximum. We will regularly review this as it will also depend on which suppliers IAG is working with in 2050, and we actively support the use of high quality negative emissions solutions to neutralize the impact of any residual emissions. The 2019 emissions figure above relates to emissions disclosed in our 2020 CDP response. Due to use of the standardised emissions factors to calculate Scope 3 emissions, we will continue to review this baseline figure and will update it if any major changes.2020 Scope 3 emissions were significantly reduced due to COVID-19. The figure used above is higher than the 3.24MT disclosed in the 2020 ARA due to the inclusion of non-material Scope 3 categories and use of reverified British Airways data."

"The Science Based Target initiative (SBTi) independently assesses and approves companies' targets to help determine a pathway for reducing companies' emissions in line with the Paris Climate Agreement's goal of limiting global warming to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels. By 2025, IFF will strive to reduce absolute GHG emissions by 30% and encourage suppliers to set their own science-based reduction targets and report annual emissions. IFF also commits to working with its suppliers (representing 70% of its supply chain emissions) so that they set their own science-based reduction targets and report annual emissions by 2025. This target's ambition is classified as consistent with keeping warming to well-below 2°C by SBTi. This year, we have integrated our recent acquisition Frutarom into our 2015 base year emissions. This update does not affect our target boundary (100% of Scope 1 and market-based Scope 2 emissions and suppliers representing 70% of our supply chain emissions for Scope 3 engagement) or our ambition (30% reduction in Scope 1 and market-based Scope 2 emissions by 2025 while working with suppliers to set their own science-based targets and report annual emissions)."
"Our goal of reducing GHG emissions by 20% (versus 2010) by the end of 2020 includes both Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. We achieved a 21.4% reduction in 2020 which exceeds our 2020 goal of a 20% reduction.  Scope 1 emissions are direct emissions resulting from our own operations, including on-site fossil fuel usage and relatively modest emissions from on-site landfills and treatment of discharged water. Our Scope 2 emissions are indirect emissions resulting from the offsite utility generation of the steam and electricity we purchase. Through continuous improvements in operations, equipment, energy efficiency and fuel diversity, we achieved significant company-wide reductions in Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions. Our GHG goal includes all facilities owned and operated by International Paper. We operate nearly 230 converting and recycling locations. Emissions outside of our direct operations and purchased energy are considered Scope 3 emissions and are not included in this report, but will be a part of our Vision 2030 goal. We continue to work with partners and increase efforts to reduce our emissions.We use the GHG Protocol for Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standards to inform our GHG goal accounting and reporting.  Our emissions calculations for our current goal are global, and do not include joint ventures with non-operational control, biogenic CO2, or any acquisitions or divestitures that occurred during the reporting year. Baseline emission data recalculations are made annually to incorporate acquired facilities and take out divested facilities, which accounts for slight YOY changes in emissions data."
"Vision 2030 GHG Goal - Reduce our Scope 1, 2, & 3 greenhouse gas emissions by 35% versus 2019, aligned with best-available climate science.After successfully meeting our Vision 2020 goal, IP announced Vision 2030 goals in 2020. As part of our Vision 2030, we have committed to incremental reductions in our Scope I, II and III greenhouse gas emissions. Our target is a 35% reduction between 2021 and 2030. Our greenhouse gas emissions reduction goal is consistent with the Paris Climate Agreement. Furthermore, we use biomass and manufacturing residuals (rather than fossil fuels) to generate a majority of the manufacturing energy at our mills. We have submitted our Vision 2030 GHG goal to SBTi for approval and it is currently being reviewed. Our goal was set using the science-based target setting methodology known as the Sector Decarbonization Approach (SDA), which is based on a Beyond 2°C scenario (B2DS) developed by the International Energy Agency (IEA) and approved by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). We employed the SBTi tool to determine the appropriate GHG reductions for our goal."
"IPG has excluded operations that do not meet the criteria for 'significant operations"" from  its Scope 1 & 2 emissions target.  IPG defines ''significant operations” as those locations that perform manufacturing or machine assembly and the company's corporate and executive headquarters.This definition would encompass all of the locations listed on our corporate website at: https://www.itape.com/about%20ipg with the exception of Flensburg, Germany, as this location does not employ a material number of employees."

These results were also achieved through the implementation of various paperless initiatives. The reduction in paper consumption also continued in 2020 thanks to the implementation of dematerialisation measures. Considering only the actions launched in the last five years, in 2020 around 2,370 tonnes of paper was saved, corresponding to 3,940 tonnes of CO2 avoided and a theoretical cost saving of around 4.2 million euro."

"In 2019, Intrum defined a climate reduction target to reduce our emissions in all three scopes by 20%. In order to meet this target, Intrum has established action plans in every market (i.e. on a country-level) for reducing emissions from the operations.  Examples of actions are changing electricity from non-renewable sources to renewable sources, or eliminate plastic bottles."
"Intuit has a scope 1 & 2 absolute target of 80% reduction by 2025, base year 2012. Intuit has reduced its scope 1 & 2 emissions 88% since 2012."
"Intuit has a scope 1, 2 and 3 absolute target of 50% reduction by 2025, base year 2012. Intuit has reduced its emissions by 67% since 2012 (23,481 metric tonnes in FY20). It surpassed its goal 5 years early."
"Intuit has reduced its Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions by 67% since 2012.  Our 2050 goal is a 80% reduction. We are ahead of schedule for our 2050 target."
"Intuit has a target to be carbon neutral every year from fiscal year (FY) 2015 onward (beginning August 1, 2014). We achieved carbon neutrality in FY20 (the reporting period) through a combination of onsite renewable electricity generation, internal energy efficiency projects, and purchases of renewable electricity and carbon offsets. Intuit offsets all Scope 1, 2 and 3 (supply chain, partner data centers, business travel and employee commute) emissions. We understand that CDP guidance requests that companies not consider carbon offsets when reporting targets. However, we have elected to report offsets in order to communicate this achievement; we have also reported additional targets without offsets.  We aim to maintain this goal and commitment every year moving forward. We feel strongly that carbon credits are a viable way to mitigate our impacts on the climate as we prioritize emissions reductions and avoidance."
"Our target is to reduce carbon emission 2% each year since 2018, this is base on all the carbon gas generated during  the production in our site."

"Investor has set climate targets in line with the Paris Agreement and has used a Science-based Target Setting Tool. The absolute contraction approach was used to find the percentage of reduction needed to be in line with the Paris Agreement of limiting warming to well below 2°C and aiming for 1.5°C. As we are a small organization, we have limited resources to conduct the process of SBTi, but we have followed their method and principles in our analysis and goal formulation. Investor is in the process of formally committing to the Exponential Roadmap and Race to Zero. Investor uses financial year actuals (no average figures). The target covers our emissions in scope 1 and 2 from company cars and purchased electricity and heating."
"Investor used the Science-based Target Setting Tool and the absolute contraction approach to identify the percentage of reduction needed to be in line with the Paris Agreement. For our scope 3 emissions (related to our investments) we are proud to have gone beyond the SBTi method, whose approach is to take as sufficient a scope 3 emissions reduction target that stands for a high proportion. It is in our role as an owner (investments) where Investor has the most impact, and Investor has set the same reduction speed for this target as for our scope 1 and 2 emission target.Investor uses financial year actuals (no average figures) and collects GHG emissions data directly from our portfolio companies. The overall portfolio target is to reduce portfolio companies' scope 1 and 2 emissions by 50 percent by 2030 compared to 2016. This is an absolute reduction target for the overall portfolio (not an equity approach). The reason for setting the target on the total level is to drive all our portfolio companies to reduce their emissions and not be able to divest in companies with higher emissions. The baseline year is 2016 to align our strategy period with Agenda 2030 and the Global Sustainability Goals.In 2020, greenhouse gas emissions from our overall portfolio decreased by 40 percent compared to 2016. We have internal milestones for this long-term target and it's not linear due to the need for innovation and technological development. As we have no operating control over the companies, we are driving this at the board level. In the yearly sustainability questionnaire Investor tracked that 78 percent of our companies had targets to reduce scope 1 and 2 emissions.  By the end of 2020, 57 percent of our portfolio companies had aligned their climate strategies to the Paris Agreement and set measurable targets to decrease greenhouse gas emissions by 50 percent or more by 2030. We expect more companies to commit to ambitious climate targets within the next five years.Investor has also set a second portfolio target to ensure that all of our companies have relevant reduction targets for scope 3 emissions (reported under C4.2)."
"In 2020 INWIT committed to achieving  zero Scope 2 market-based emissions (company-wide emissions) by 2022 through the purchase of 100% renewable energy. Furthermore, the new three-year plan defined by INWIT in 2020 set a target to achieve carbon neutrality by 2025 as a result of measuring the corporate carbon footprint, reducing emissions with ambitious targets and offsetting residual GHG emissions through the purchase of carbon credits."
"During the last years, IBA developed several initiatives and projects related to the sustainability at large, and environmental impact reduction in particular. These initiatives include:- Evaluation of the carbon impact of IBA s.a. (GHG protocol, scopes 1 and 2).- At the level of our product installed base, an evaluation of the last 10 years impact was done. This evaluation includes the impact of IBA sold products (electrical consumption + SF6 estimated loss).In 2016, the technological evolution of products and infrastructure was expected to roughly allow 5% reduction of climate impact, compared with a BAU scenario. Since then, this evaluation has not been achieved anymore. The main reason for not evaluating the long-term environmental scenario is a too high uncertainty on the market evolution and the sales estimations for the coming years.As an outcome, IBA decided to focus on its environmental hot spots meaning: 1) operations part of scopes 1 and 2 and 2) the use phase of its products installed base (through energy efficiency and Ecodesign).The target described here deals with the 1), meaning operations, commuting and business travels."
"The target refers to all Scope 1 and 2 emissions deriving from Iren Group's activities. The reduction of 34% at 2035 will be possible through: zeroing scope 2 emissions purchasing energy 100% certified green and realizing of PV plants on plants and offices for self-consumption; zeroing emissions from the vehicle fleet using only ecovehicles; introducing new technologies to capture CO2; gradually introducing blending of hydrogen and other green gasses, replacing a part of natural gas in cogeneration, thermal and thermoelectric plants."

"We are committed to reducing our greenhouse (GHG) emissions to help mitigate the effects of climate change. In early 2019, Iron Mountain's science-based target (SBT) was approved by the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi). Later in 2019, responding to calls from leading climate institutions, we voluntarily revised our SBT to align with a scenario well below 2°C. Using 2016 as a baseline, Iron Mountain committed to reduce absolute GHG emissions 25% (initially 20%) by 2025."
"This is a medium-term target that covers 100% of ISDIN's scope 1 + 2 emissions and aims to reduce 40% of these emissions by contracting renewable energy for most of the company's facilities and by transitioning the company´s own fleet to hybrid or more efficient cars.This goal is related to ISDIN's sustainability goals (Blue Wave program), more specifically with the change in the energy source of all ISDIN facilities in the world to a renewable source. This is a medium-term objective that will be completed by a long-term one, as ISDIN has already identified that there are facilities in regions that does not have a renewable energy supply or there is no information needed to assess the electrical energy mix and that, therefore, will required long-term strategies. ISDIN's business model, which prioritizes the lease or use of coworking facilities, requires the sharing of this target with the objectives of other companies. For this reason, ISDIN intends to carry out an engagement process in the following years with its installation partners to enable renewable energy contracts.In 2018, there was no energy consumed by ISDIN from renewable sources and the entire fleet was diesel or gasoline. This target meets the 2.1% year-on-year emission reduction between base year and target year. Once this target has been reached, even before the target year, ISDIN commits to maintain 100% renewable energy contracts beyond 2030 (see Abs2 target). In addition to the reduction in emissions associated to the generation of energy consumed by its plants, ISDIN has another metric to monitoring this target, namely: m2 of facilities using renewable energy. The evolution of this metric from the base year to the reporting year was: 2018 (0%), 2020 (83,36% mostly in Spain). This is a mid-term target (2030) and ISDIN has already managed to have 100% of its facilities in Spain with renewable energy and has started the transition of its own fleet.For the next years, ISDIN intends to pursue this objective in its facilities throughout Europe and in other countries that form the boundaries of this CDP. This is not a Science based target but ISDIN wants to publicly state the aim of setting a science-based target in the next 2 years through the Call to Action commitment. See C12.4 for the attached commitment letter sent to SBTi for  joining the Business Ambition for 1,5°C campaign of SBTi."

"Isuzu Motors integrated its environmental initiatives in FY2016 and in 2019 set renewed targets for CO2 emissions. As part of that process, we reviewed SCOPE as a whole, and set the range covered by the targets from existing plants to 100%. At that time, we undertook a review of our approach to setting targets. With plans such as increases to production volumes, commissioning of new factories, and increases to office floor area in place, setting reduction targets is difficult at this point in time, so our goal regarding the extent of increase in BaU levels in our production plans is to not let them increase.We have announced our new mid-term business plan and, in addition to a three-year plan similar to the mid-term business plan, we are conducting activities towards the setting of CO2 reduction from a long-term viewpoint of 10 years or more as a sustainable company as defined in the mid-term business plan.While we will undertake an analysis, there has been a major reduction in CO2 due to COVID-19, and Japan's CO2 emission intensity of power generation has improved markedly."
We have set a target of 1% reduction year-on-year in Thailand.The target was not achieved because the production volume increased due to the last-minute demand before the model change.

"Base emissions include 100% of the consolidated businesses of the group as of 31.12.2019 (whole operations) market based. Toscana Energia was only consolidated for 3 months in 2019, hence the baseline is recalculated to reflect 12 months of Toscana Energia for 2019.The target covers 100% of group Scope 1 and 2 emissions (2020 data). The target anticipated an increase in leak detection activity with an initial stable/higher emissions and a drop after, on the back of actions implementedThe great majority of Italgas emissions are fugitive emissions originated from gas distribution while Scope 2 emissions are very small.Thanks to the digital transformation of the network and the technological innovations implemented in leak detection Italgas expects that by 2026 it will have reduced methane emissions by 20% as reported in its 2020-26 Strategic Plan and other emissions. As regards leak detection, in 2018, Italgas introduced and now makes extensive use of CRDS (Cavity Ring-Down Spectroscopy) technology developed by Picarro. It consists of a sophisticated sensing technology that, compared with traditional technologies, offers important advantages in terms of the speed of conduct and extent of areas under control. Relative to a regulatory requirement to inspect the whole network on a 3 to 4 years rolling basis, with Picarro, Italgas plans to inspect the whole network at least annually. Further Picarro can detect leaks with a sensitivity three times greater than that currently used by all other industry operators (parts per billion vs parts per million); identify a gas leak even a few dozen meters away from the route covered by the equipped vehicle thanks to specific on-board sensors and sophisticated calculation software. Thanks to this technology, Italgas is the only operator in Italy to carry out scheduled gas leakage detection, also extended to all the underground and overhead connections, albeit this activity is not prescribed by current legislation and regulations. Thanks to the results of Picarro, Italgas is able to intervene on leaks much more quickly, reducing dispersions of methane, and on even small dispersions. Internal requirements on time of intervention on assessed leaks have been harshened. Other measures include lower energy consumption for industrial and civil uses, vehicle fleet optimisation. Target assumes constant perimeter."
"For the year 2020 we had set very aggressive reduction targets on Scope2 emissions (Electic energy indirect emissions) and the initiatives were connected both to a rationalization project of the testplants in Carini, which involved both abandoning the centralized system and using a HVAC plant dedicated to the IT needs and a strong rationalization of testplants in Castelletto. During 2020, the Carini project confirmed the forecasts and to this effect was added that of the covid19 pandemic which made it possible to reduce our emissions beyond the expected target, thanks to the introduction of the massive smart working."
The effect of the Covid 19 pandemic and the introduction of smart working has also greatly improved the target for aggregate emissions (scope1 and scope2).The abandonment of the company canteens has allowed the extra abatement of the direct emissions connected to them.to  this effect  the reduced use of the office areas and corporate service cars has been added.
"The additional effect is always linked to the covid2019 pandemic and the impact on business travels (Scope3 upstream). Also in this case, the reduction in business travels (balanced by the increase in videoconferencing) led to an extremely significant extra target.The overall result on emissions is changing ta way of working in favor of remote working and smart working."
"In 2018 we revisited our emissions targets and started using the Science Based Targets methodology for Scopes 1 and 2.Therefore, we set the targets for this new methodology. In 2020, our Scope 1 emissions from operations in Brazil totaled 14,561 tCO2e. Our scope 1 target reflects our direct contribution in GHG gases to all our facilities in Brazil, excluding external ones in Latin America, which results in a coverage of 89.26% of our operating revenue. We are public committed to reduce our scope 1 emissions by 4% between 2018 and 2021 in absolute terms, which is already achieved. During 2021, Itaú-Unibanco will define new scope 1 emissions reduction targets."

"The Duratex absolute target established is: ''Reduce 25% of Duratex's direct emissions (Scope 1)” in relation to the base year (2012). It was developed in 2016, based on a review of Duratex's material themes that resulted in the company's Sustainability Strategy, to be started in 2017. This target covers Duratex's operations in Brazil, excluding the Ceramic Coatings business. In 2012, Duratex's participation in the capital of Tablemac (currently Duratex Colombia) went from 25% to 37%, and its emissions have not yet been accounted for, so the percentage of Scope emissions was 100% in the base year. In 2020, the operations contemplated in the target would represent 95.58% of direct emissions.Currently, the Strategy and its targets are under review, with the aim of establishing a science-based emission target. Considering the projections made at the time the milestones were drawn up, the emissions from Duratex's Brazilian operations in 2020, which include the Deca (Metals and Ceramics), Hydra and Wood (Forest and Panels) divisions, and being accounted for for the first time, Ceramic Coating , totaled 270,958.25 tCO2e, above the expected milestone for 2020 (203,218.69 tCO2e). The increase in the company's absolute emissions of approximately 9% was due to acquisitions and expansions in the Ceramic Coatings area. The expected evolution to reach the goal in 2025 was not linear, since variable production projections were considered. It is important to highlight that Duratex is revisiting its emissions targets, including for the Colombia and Ceramic Coating units. The expectation is to disclose the goals with a scientific basis in 2021, together with the Company's new Sustainability Strategy.  The goals are to reduce emissions and maintain a positive carbon balance within the business."
"The absolute reduction of 11% by 2030 in scope 1,2 emissions is based on the following goals:– Enhancing the share of renewable energy usage to 50% of total energy consumption by 2030.– Meeting 100% of purchased grid electricity requirements from renewable sources by 2030.– Reducing specific energy consumption by 30% and specific GHG emissions by 50% by 2030 as compared to a FY 2018-19 baseline.The absolute reduction in scope 1,2 emissions is expected to accompany the achievement of above goals. Business growth assumptions have also been taken into account as part of this goal. We are reporting on this goal for the first time to CDP.The performance for 2020-21 is driven by impact on the paper, tobacco and hotel business on account of the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdowns.The goal covers all ITC units across businesses - FMCG, Hotels, Packaging, Paperboards & Specialty Papers and Agri-Business."
"This scope 1&2 target of 46.2% reduction in emissions by 2030 forms a major part of ITV's wider environmental strategy, for which targets were set and published in 2020.

"Although figures this year show we have achieved this absolute reduction target this year we still consider it valid as variations in work load and type of work undertaken can cause both positive and negative changes to our absolute emissions.  In 2019, we achieved circa 21.2% absolute reduction from the baseline period.   Our long term target is to be a carbon positive business, and in line with the UK target, we aim to produce ''net zero"" greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and ""Net Positive"" by 2050. This includes all scope 1, scope 2 and mandated scope 3 elements of our UK business."
In 2020 Sainsbury's committed to reduce absolute scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions 50% by FY2030 and 100% by 2040 from a FY2019 base year. These targets are consistent with the reductions required to keep warming to 1.5°C.

"This business travel target reported covers our Scope 3 business travel including air travel, rental cars, personal vehicle travel, and hotel stays. With business travel representing 60% of our quantified carbon footprint, it was essential that we take action quickly and set a target in 2019 to reduce this impact.  The COVID-19 pandemic greatly impacted our FY20 business travel emissions. Business travel is our largest source of carbon emissions, and as expected, we saw a reduction – 50% – in our Scope 3 emissions from FY19, mainly due to COVID-19 restricting both domestic and international travel. Our goal moving forward will be to prevent rebound of these emissions back to pre COVID-19 levels, as business travel resumes a semblance of normalcy, and continue to reduce our absolute business travel emissions in accordance with our science-based target 50% by 2030 from 2019 levels."

In conjunction therewith, Jacobs adopted science-based carbon-reduction targets including this commitment to reduce absolute scope 3 GHG emissions from business travel and employee commuting 50% by 2030 from a 2019 base year. We completed a Scope 3 screening evaluation in 2020 using FY19 data to identify Scope 3 sources that are material to Jacobs and assess where we can make impactful changes. Based on screening level estimates for employee commuting and purchased goods and services and our calculated emissions for business travel, our three largest Scope 3 sources include business travel, employee commuting and purchased goods and services. These sources comprise approximately 95% of all our Scope 3 emissions. As a result, Jacobs committed to the following science-based target in 2020:  Reduce absolute Scope 3 GHG emissions from business travel and employee commuting 50% by 2030 from a 2019 base year.The COVID-19 pandemic greatly impacted our FY20 business travel emissions.

"The Japan Petroleum Development Association (hereinafter the ''Association”), an industry organization to which JAPEX belongs, participates in the Commitment to a Low Carbon Society formulated by the Japan Business Federation (''Keidanren”)*. In line with the Commitment, we have set the GHG emission reduction targets for the Association as a whole. In fiscal 2020, we set a target of a 5% reduction in GHG emissions compared to fiscal 2005, and in fiscal 2030, a 28% reduction compared to fiscal 2013. To achieve the Association's 2020 target, GHG emissions targets are assigned to its member companies. As a member of the Association, we need to reduce emissions to the level of 137,000 tons or less, which is the target assigned to us. To this end, we have promoted emission reduction activities such as energy saving at production sites and reduction of the vent and flare emissions. As a result, our GHG emissions in fiscal 2020 were 127,176 tons**, which was lower than the target of 137,000 tons, thus achieving the target assigned to us for fiscal 2020. Status of achievement of the GHG emission target for the Association is being compiled.* Keidanren consists of more than 100 leading Japanese industrial associations. It is promoting GHG reduction by positioning global warming countermeasures as a key policy issue. The Association is one of the member organizations of Keidanren.** As the current GHG reduction target for the Association has several limiting conditions such that emissions are limited to those from the domestic E&P business and excludes concomitant CO2, the scope of the target does not coincide with the total amount of our Scope 1 & 2 emissions.***The GHG reduction  target in fiscal 2020 for the Association as  a whole is to reduce emissions by 5% from the fiscal 2005 level (222,674 tons-CO2e) to 211,540 tons CO2e or less.Our quota for fiscal 2020 is to limit our emissions to 137,000 tons CO2e or less, and we have achieved this target, but this means that we are allowed to increase our emissions by 27% from the 2005 level of 107,560 tons CO2e."

"JLL science-based target covers our global Scopes 1 and 2 footprint. We have chosen to align our science-based target with the 1.5°C trajectory set forth by the IPCC and Paris Climate Agreement, the most stringent recommended reduction pathway. JLL is one of just ninety-nine companies from all industries and one of only eight real estate companies that have validated targets aligned to 1.5°C. We believe setting an ambitious science-based target is the right thing to do and during this time of global pandemic provides us the foundation to build back better. We will achieve our Scopes 1 and 2 targets by:•Office efficiency: Driving energy efficiency in our existing office portfolio and taking on highly efficient office space at lease events.•Electric vehicles: Shifting our fleet to low and no-emissions vehicles.•Use of renewable energy: Moving our offices onto renewable energy wherever possible and reducing our use of non-renewable energy.•Purchasing of Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs): Purchasing RECs or equivalent measures in those markets where renewable energy is unavailable."

"JM is an active member and on the board/the steering committee of the Haga Initiative.  During 2016 the Haga Initiative decided that the new climate target should be net zero emissions by 2030 for the operations in Sweden. JM has decided to support the target which includes emissions in scope 1, scope 2 and the parts in scope 3 (upstream, production, downstream) where JM has influence to decrease the emissions. In 2020 JM's absolute emissions for the operations in Sweden in scope 1, 2 and 3 decreased by 8262 ton CO2e or 36% compared to the emissions in the baseline year 2010. JM has ten more years until target completion, and we believe that we will continue to reduce the emissions in both scope 1, 2 and 3 through decreased energy consumption in the construction phase and the first two years in the user phase. We have also introduced new environmental requirements for fuels and transports in 2019, which have increased the use of renewable energy and fuels in scope 1, 2 and 3."

"This target was set in 2010 as a long-term goal. In 2015 it was evaluated to determine if it was in alignment with science-based targets. The evaluation concluded that our original goal was consistent with a 2-degree pathway and also provided us with additional information for setting a long-term 2050 goal. Additionally, our next generation goals (scopes 1, 2 and 3) has been approved by the Science-based Targets Initiative and were launched in 2020 (see Abs 1&2 goals). Our Health for Humanity 2020 Goal is to enroll suppliers covering 80% of spend in our Sustainable Procurement Program by 2020. We were unable to enroll enough of our supply base to achieve our 2020 target due to the impact of COVID-19 on Johnson & Johnson's capacity to perform supplier assessments and on our suppliers' abilities to meet the requirements of our Supplier Sustainability Program. To make progress towards the goal, we set incremental annual targets for percentage of spend with suppliers enrolled in our Sustainable Procurement Program. In 2020 the top 74% of suppliers within the annual percentage spend target participated. Participating suppliers are required to conform to our Responsibility Standards for Suppliers and fulfill one or more of four requirements listed below, determined for each supplier category by category leadership: 1) Transparency: publicly reporting two or more sustainability goals and tracking progress over time; 2) Disclosure to Action: annual participation in CDP Supply Chain disclosure; 3) Sustainability Excellence: achieving a high performers assessment score (using industry standard methods); 4) Leadership: implementing category-specific goals that support relevant industry trends, practices or innovative ideas to which suppliers and others may contribute. We then use this data to identify opportunities to collaborate with our suppliers on emission reduction activities."
"This target is company-wide. This target is an interim goal in our roadmap to be net zero before 2040:In early 2021 we committed to The Climate Pledge to be net zero by 2040, ahead of the Paris Agreement's goal of 2050. To achieve this, we have set an interim target aligned with the pathway to limit global warming to 1.5 deg C above pre-industrial levels. This is known as a Science Based Target and has been approved by the NGO collaborative known as the Science Based Target Initiative as being aligned with the science. Specifically, our target is to reduce absolute emissions from our operations (Scopes 1 & 2) by 55 percent and reduce absolute emissions from the use of sold products by 16 percent by 2030 from a 2017 baseline. Further, in 2018 Johnson Controls set 2025 targets for energy and emissions reductions as part of a new Sustainability Strategy. The targets are to reduce operational Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas intensity and energy intensity, normalized to revenue, by 25 percent by 2025 from a 2017 baseline. Our path to zero is first based on achieving our interim targets which we will do by focusing on four key areas: energy efficiency, renewables, electrification of our fleet, and refrigerant management and transition. Emissions from energy, fleet and fugitive refrigerant emissions are each about 30 percent of total Scope 1 and 2 emissions. This year, 2021, annual targets associated with our 2025 Sustainability Strategy are embedded in Enterprise Leadership scorecards, with annual targets for energy and emissions intensity and absolute reduction in refrigerant emissions on the CEO scorecard and tied to compensation. From 2022 through 2030 the CEO scorecard KPIs will be linked to the 2030 targets, including emissions from the use of sold products, absolute scope 1 and 2 emissions and our commitment to double energy productivity."

We have also committed to supporting investing aligned with net zero emissions by 2050 or sooner, prioritising the achievement of real economy emissions reductions within the sectors and companies in which we invest. In making this commitment, we recognise the urgent need to accelerate the transition towards global net zero emissions and for asset managers like Jupiter to play our part to help deliver the goals of the Paris Agreement and ensure a just transition. We will be undertaking a project in 2021 to understand what this commitment will mean for us with regards to our targets."
"In both 2019 and 2020 the Group had purchased Renewable Energy Certificates to cover electricity and cooling across all Group units, but in summer 2020 Jyske Bank purchased a wind turbine at the Port of Hirtshals. Initially the wind turbine was purchased to offset CO2 emissions from electricity consumption via our own production of renewable energy. Jyske Bank is now taking the next step, with a new target for CO2 emissions relating to heating and company cars to be covered by our own production of renewable energy.By the end of 2022 we will offset our CO2 emissions from electricity, heating and driving the bank's vehicles with our own production of renewable energy.Further information on targets can be found in Jyske Bank's Sustainability Report 2020: https://investor.jyskebank.com/wps/wcm/connect/jbc/fe6b1ee5-e980-42fa-aadb-6ac2c5efdcb4/Sustainability+Report+2020+%281%29.pdf?MOD=AJPERES&CVID=nzZZumr"

"In 2020, we have set ourselves the goal to become CO2 neutral as a company until 2027. We aim to reduce scope 1-3 emissions as much as possible and compensate the remaining emissions. Within the scope 1 calculation we have covered emissions of our production sites in Austria and Canada (power consumption, cooling, heating, fleet) and the company car emissions at our major locations larger than 5,000 m² ( (office sites in Austria, Sweden, South Africa). The scope 2 calculation covers power consumption, cooling, heating of the office sites in Austria, Sweden, South Africa.The scope 3 calculation so far only covers emissions caused by business flights from all major locations: production sites in Austria and Canada as well as office sites in Austria, Sweden, South Africa, France, UK, Bulgaria, Chile, Poland, Russia, Spain and the US. Other sites are currently not evaluated.We are in the course of identifying the current company carbon footprint and the product carbon footprints for our key solutions, and defining measures on how to consequently reduce them. In addition, we put a focus on the reduction potential of our solutions. Within the next year we plan to complete the calculation of the global company carbon footprint."
"In 2020 we faced a significant increase in overall production as indicated in the increase of total company revenues. With the ongoing pandemic, we had to ensure proper distancing to all company associates, thus reopening some rooms that were previously kept closed, and we also ensured all rooms were well-heated to avoid associates from getting cold and develop any type of disease that could have kept them from working regularly. This led to an increase in CO2 emissions related to factory heating. Thanks to other measures implemented, such as production of renewable energy etc, however, total greenhouse gas emissions in 2020 declined from 0.008 kgs/$ to 0.006 kgs/$"
"Since 2019 we set annual absolute emission reduction target (Scope 1 + Scope 2), based on the year 2018 requiring 10% annual reduction. For the year 2020 we achieved the requirements of this target by additional 17%."

"- A group wide target on our overall scope 1, scope 2 (market-based) and scope 3 emissions excluding commuter travel was achieved during the reporting year 2020: cutting our own GHG emissions by 25% for the period 2015-20.- 81.16% in the column ‘% emissions in Scope' reflects that emissions from commuter travel are out of scope of the target (= 18.84% of total GHG emissions in the base year 2015).- Science-based target: We consider this target as a science-based target as the average annual reduction (i.e. 5% (= 25%/(2020-2015) is aligned with 1.5°C scenario, surpassing the minimum annual linear reduction rates aligned with 1.5?C scenario of 4.2% (as required by the SBTi, source: CDP Technical note on science-based targets). By signing the Collective Commitment to Climate Action in September 2019, KBC bolsters its determination – in cooperation with its clients – to stimulate the greening of the economy as much as possible and thus to limit global warming to well below 2°C, striving for 1.5°C, in line with the Paris Climate Agreement. We already have targets in place to reduce our direct environmental footprint to significantly below the 2°C scenario, but KBC is also committed to addressing its indirect impact on the climate. This means that KBC will take into account the lending to and investment in activities and projects of its clients in the calculation of that impact. KBC will publish a first round of quantitative targets by end 2022. To this end, we are actively involved in several pilot projects, in collaboration with third parties, to the development of scientifically underpinned methods for identifying the indirect carbon impact of our core activities as a bank, insurer and asset manager."

"In 2016, KBC decided to stop direct financing of coal-related activities and committed to exit such financing in the Czech Republic by 2050 at the latest (exposure ad. EUR 252 mln in 2016). After an intermediate tightening of the energy policy in 2018, KBC committed in 2020 to a full exit from all direct coal-related financing by end 2021 (EUR 11 mln remaining in 2020). We have translated this target on direct coal-related exposure in an absolute emission target for this business activity (= target coverage) (ABS 8) for the purpose of this question based upon the following method: estimated GHG emissions associated with the direct financing were calculated based on following sources (in order of appearance these sources provide high to lower quality GHG emissions): 1) EU ETS registry with 2016 verified GHG emissions (10% of exposure)2) coal production (in tons) and coal-fired power plants (in MW) information from the PACTA physical asset dataset of 4Q19 (5%)3) 2018 coal production (in tons) information from the European Association for Coal and Lignite (84%). For non-EU ETS derived GHG emission data, physical units were converted to associated CO2 emissions as follows: -For coal mining the coal production associated estimated CO2 emissions obtained based on the GEM 4 factor formula containing several assumptions and proxies (https://www.gem.wiki/Estimating_carbon_dioxide_emissions_from_coal_mines)-For power companies the installed capacity associated estimated CO2 emissions obtained based on the GEM 4 factor formula containing several assumptions and proxies (https://www.gem.wiki/Estimating_carbon_dioxide_emissions_from_coal_plants)As a final step we calculated our share in company emissions on a loan-weighted average basis: estimated emissions company*granted exposure company/total coal-related granted exposure.100% coverage as we only calculated GHG emissions from financing direct coal-related activities in the base year. Please note that given the limited remaining exposure at year-end 2020 ad. EUR 11 mln and negligible related GHG emissions, while exposure will further reduce to zero in 2021, we do not report these emissions in question C-FS14.1a (includes GHG from mortgage & car loans only).Given the steep average annual reduction (24.9% (= 99.6%/(2020-2016)) & ultimate prospect of 0 in 2021 we consider this aligned with a 1.5?C scenario."

"TIER uses a carbon pricing and emissions trading system with the intention to encourage industrial GHG emissions. Under TIER, Keyera determined the emission reduction obligation or target based on a facility-specific benchmark approach for each facility that emits more than 100,000 tCO2e per year (Large Final Emitters). The benchmark is a facility-specific emission intensity target. Based on the production of a year, an absolute emission target can be derived. Keyera's goal  is to emit less than the absolute emission targets for the our large final emitter facilities."

Our total energy consumption across facilities decreased by 6.9% (from 93,254tCO2e to 87,207tCO2e) as compared to Fiscal Year 2019."
"Kia is pursuing Net zero and has set mid-term targets considered for Net zero . However, Net zero  is currently being considered in more detail so there is a possibility that some targets will be changed in the future."

"Kia has set a Scope3 target regarding the use of sold products. The scope3 emissions from the use of sold products account for 85% of total emissions, so we strive to reduce Scope3 emissions through the GHG reduction target from the use of sold products. The Scope3 target for the use of sold products is to reduce 56.6% by 2035 compared to 2019."
"The scope 1 & 2 and scope 3  inbound logistic were calculated in the base year 2015.  2020,  we calculated additional scope 3 emission categories. To compare the reporting year with the base year we exclude these categories. We disclose them in another chapter of this questionnaire. The increase of emissions can be related to the expansion of shops and employees as well as the more detailed balancing of emissions in the reporting year. The target of 10 % is set to approach to the 30 % target of the United Nations Fashion Industry Charter which is still on our map for a successful emissions reduction."
"We received validation of our Science-Based Targets in September 2018 to reduce scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions on a like-for-like basis by 31% from a 2017 base year by 2030 with a longer-term goal of a 72% reduction by 2050 in alignment with the IPCC – Fifth Assessment Report (5AR).  In 2018 we committed to achieving carbon neutral operations of our scope 1 and 2 (market-based) emissions by December 31, 2020, a goal we achieved. This means that the entirety of our scope 1 and scope 2 emissions is offset through a combination of energy efficiency measures, both onsite and offsite renewables and RECs. This exceeds our carbon reduction goals previously validated by Science-Based Targets. Science-Based Targets is a collaboration between the Carbon Disclosure Project, the United Nations Global Compact, the World Resources Institute and the World Wide Fund for Nature, which independently assesses and approves the carbon reduction goals of companies."
"This target is underway. Now that we have achieved carbon neutral operations of our scope 1 and 2 market-based emissions, we are focusing on reducing our Scope 3 emissions. We have reduced the emissions of our downstream leased assets by 92% from 2017 to 2020 primarily by selling off triple net assets between 2017 and 2019. The reduced emissions in 2020 is heavily influenced by the reduced occupancy due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We will continue to work with our tenants to help them reduce their emissions through undertaking projects on triple net buildings, installing renewables, such as solar panels, on triple net buildings, and helping tenants procure 100% renewable power from our utilities."
"In 2019, Kimball Electronics set company-wide goals to be achieved by the end of the year 2025. Based on our 2019 emissions, we are to reduce our Greenhouse Gas emissions by 10%.  As shown above, in 2019 our Scope 1, 2, and 3 GHG emissions were 50,657.47 MT CO2e. In 2020 we reduced these emissions to 48,911.91 MT CO2e. This is a reduction of our GHG emissions by 3.44% as compared to the 2019 emission total."
"In 2019, Kimball Electronics set company-wide goals to be achieved by the end of the year 2025.  One of our goals is to reduce our usage of electricity using KWH as the measurement. Our overall goal is an absolute number in that we want to reduce the amount of KWH we use. If we continue to reduce the amount of electrical energy we use, then this will have a major effect on our Green House Gas emissions.  In 2019 we used 65,084,563 KWH of electricity. In 2020, this was reduced to 63,020,939 KWH; a reduction of 3.17%."
"In 2019, Kimball Electronics set company-wide goals to be achieved by the end of the year 2025. A goal we have set is for us to reduce the Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) emissions we report to the governmental agencies around the world by 10%. This goal is not part of the CDP process but one we feel shows that Kimball Electronics is working to make a better world around us. We wish to note that this is based on our EMS and DCMS facilities. In 2019, we had reported 76.38 tons of VOC emitted. In 2020, we reduced this to 62.91 tons of VOC; a reduction of 17.63%."
"This project is in support of one of our company-wide 2025 goals that we are working to be successful. By the end of 2025, we will reduce our GHG emissions, company-wide, by 10%In our Poland facility: our Significant Environmental Aspect goal was to reduce our electrical usage by 3.5% in 2020 as compared to 2019. We used 10,820.335 MWH in 2019 and reduced it to 10,177.09 MWH in 2020. This is a 5.9% reduction.  A reflection on the actual GHG emissions are shown above. In 2019 we had 10,207.17 MT CO2e; and in 2020, this was reduced to 9,625.23 MT CO2e. This was achieved by the following:?Modernization of lighting (using LED lighting in the production hall - approx. 900 light points)?Ongoing optimization of compressor and air conditioning system,?Changes in air conditioning systems in plant shutdowns.?Reduction of the air flow rate to the hall?Matrix exchange in the IT systemThe costs involved in our actions was $72,420 USD. Our savings were $41,300 USD. Overall, this project was a success."
"This is a local project for our Poland facility.  The SEA goal is to reduce our municipal waste that the facility generates by 2%. Overall, the facility was measuring by the amount of municipal waste generated per employee. In 2019 the amount was 7.14 kg per employee; the goal for 2020 would be 7.03 kg per employee. The final result in 2020 was 3.32 kg per employee. In looking at the GHG emissions, we see that they achieved their goal. This was achieved by the following:?Internal audits of the environmental system.?Audits of 5S Practices covering waste segregation.?Training employees on segregation as part of 5S trainingThere was a savings involved of $1,278 USD. Overall, the project was a success."

This absolute reduction target covers Scope 1 + 2 (market-based) with the base year 2018 and target year 2023.  The largest part of this target is electricity and this is why we intent to buy renewable energy certificates and Guarantees of Origin for 100 % of our electricity by 2023.
This absolute reduction target covers Scope 3 (business travels) with the base year 2018 and target year 2023. This target focus mostly on reducing emissions from flight travel. There was a large emission reduction of business travel during 2020 partly due to the covid-19. We therefore intend to keep our emissions for business travel as low as possible even during the years after the pandemic to continue to have achieved this target.
"Our original carbon targets were approved by the Science Based Targets initiative in 2019 and aligned to a 2°C trajectory. As we met our operational scope 1 and 2 target this year, we have therefore reviewed our plans and agreed new appropriate capital investment to now commit to a more ambitious 1.5°C aligned reduction target. This has been approved by the Science Based Targets initiative in June 2021. Our science-based target for scope 1 and 2 is to ""reduce absolute scope 1 & 2 GHG emissions by 38% by 2025, from a 2016 baseline.""The target covers 97% of our scope 1 and 2 emissions (emissions from purchased and consumed electricity and heat; property gas and other fuels; and haulage from dedicated delivery fleets). In 2018, we took the decision to no longer report our emissions from business travel in company cars;  this represents 3% of our total scope 1 and 2 emissions and therefore is below our materiality threshold.We achieved a 27% reduction in 2020/21 from our 2016/17 baseline, which is equivalent to 72% of our target achieved i.e. ((27.4/38)*100). This is a large movement from the previous year (FY 19/20: 18%), driven in part by the temporary closure of stores due to Covid as well as strong underlying improvementsNote that this target replaces our previous science-based target to achieve a 22% reduction in scope 1 and 2 carbon footprint (baseline 2016; target year 2025), see further details under target reference Abs 2. Our carbon reduction target is based on market-based emissions. With the sale of our Castorama Russia business, we have removed emissions associated with that business from previous years, including our 2016/17 baseline."
"We developed market-based carbon targets that were approved by the Science-Based Targets Initiative in February 2019. Our previous science-based target for scope 1 and 2 was to ""reduce absolute scope 1 & 2 GHG emissions by 22% by 2025, from a 2016 baseline.""The target covered 97% of our scope 1 and 2 emissions (emissions from purchased and consumed electricity and heat; property gas and other fuels; and haulage from dedicated delivery fleets). We achieved a 27% reduction in 2020/21 from our 2016/17 baseline, meeting our original science-basedcarbon reduction target ahead of schedule. This is a large movement from the previous year (FY 19/20: 18%), driven in part by the temporary closure of stores due to Covid as well as strong underlying improvements.Note that this target has now been replaced with a 1.5 degree aligned target approved by SBTi. Our carbon reduction target is based on the market-based emissions. With the sales of our Castorama Russia business, we have removed emissions associated with that business from previous years, including our 2016/17 baseline. In 2018, we took the decision to no longer report our emissions from business travel by road;  these represent less than 5% of our total scope 1 and 2 emissions and therefore are below our materiality threshold."
We set up the solar energy panel.
"Kingspan Group Plc commits to reduce absolute Scopes 1 and 2 GHG emissions 10% by 2025 from a 2017 base-year.In 2021, Kingspan set a new science based targets (Scope 1+2, 90% reduction by 2030 - baseline 2020), aligned with 1.5oC. We will report on this new target in our next CDP submission."
"In 2018, Kingspan Group plc committed to reduce absolute Scope 3 GHG emissions from purchased goods and services, business travel, transport and distribution, and end-of-life treatment of sold products 10% by 2025 from a 2017 base-year.  As this target requires significant technological innovation and investment, we knew progress would not be linear. It also falls outside of our control, therefore we cannot directly implement this innovation. We are actively engaging with our raw material suppliers (who make up the majority >70% of our scope 3 emissions) on an ongoing basis to ensure we make meaningful progress towards this target in the coming years.**Please note: the Kingspan Group grew substantially (revenue growth of 25%) between 2017 -2020 which the above base year figure calculation does not reflect. To reinforce our commitment to making reductions in our scope 3 emissions - In 2021, Kingspan re-baselined its SBTs (scope 3 from purchased goods and services, use of sold products and end-of-life treatment of sold products 42% by 2030) to account for business growth and to aligned with 1.5oC scenario and its ambitious new Planet Passionate decarbonisation targets. We will report on this new target in our next CDP submission."
"In the reporting year, a 92.5% reduction in Scope 2 (market based) emissions was achieved from a base year emission level of 86,208 t/C02e in 2013 to 6,410 t/C02e in 2020. We will continue to work towards using 100% renewable electricity. This commitment is also reflected in our new, 1.5oC aligned science based target, set in 2021 (we will report on these targets in our next submission)."
"The target and emission data covers the KION Group and its consolidated subsidiaries.A comprehensive climate strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in line with the 2°C target or higher ambition levels is currently being developed.Base year emissions updated corresponding to regular update of conversion and emission factors.Given the extraordinary global situation in the reporting year and the strong influence on environmental data in particular, a correct interpretation of changes compared to the previous year is only possible in individual cases."

"Target range of the report is limited to Korean operations. Although we have operations in China, Southeast Asia, US, and Europe, there are differences in the carbon emission management system and ETS operation in each country. Furthermore, it is difficult to verify the data externally in some countries, so it is difficult to collect from all businesses (Countries) at this stage.Internal review is under way to include data across all businesses in CDP reporting, and plans to expand to the scope of all businesses within two years.The Company has set and is operating short/mid/long term GHG greenhouse gas reduction target in accordance with the 'Well below 2?' standard. And the target years are 2023, 2030 and 2050 respectively.The target year of 2030 in this report is Kiswire's mid-term target in our GHG Reduction Roadmap, and it targets 37.5% reduction from the base year of 2015."
"The reduction target is based on 2004 emissions, whose value for Scope 1 was 895,474.56 tCO2eq, In 2016, with the operation of a new production Puma I unit producing around 1,500,000 tons of pulp per year, a recalculation of the base year was carried out, the year 2004 was chosen because it was the first year of the company's greenhouse gas inventory.In 2022, the company's goal is to issue 704,000 tCO2e of Scope 1, which represents a reduction of about 21.38%. In 2020, the result of Scope 1 was 100.1%. It is important to mention that the company has the planning to implement some measures and technologies that until 2022 will make it possible to reach the target. Klabin started projects to reduce the consume of diesel and heavy oil in the pulp and paper mills. This project was started in 2004, when we changed a oil for natural GAS in Piracibaba unit. Then in 2008 we changed 2 to Heavy oil Boilers for a Biomass boiler in Monte Alegre Mill and did the same action in Otacilio Costa mill (2014), Correia Pinto mill (2012) and Angatuba mill (2015).  In 2019 the fuel oil boiler at the Feira de Santana unit was replaced by a natural gas boiler, in 2020 the Puma Tall Oil plant went into operation to replace the burning of fuel oil in the lime kilns, at the Piracicaba unit, the new biomass boiler, scheduled for 2021, replaces one fuel oil boiler and three natural gas boilers that will be kept on standby for situations when the biomass boiler stops.To reaffirm our commitment to implementing actions to combat climate change, Klabin is the first Brazilian company in the sector of forests, pulp and paper to be part of the ""Companies Taking Action"" initiative of the validation of our goals based on Science Based Targets.Science-based targets provide companies with a clearly defined pathway to future-proof growth by specifying how much and how quickly they need to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions."
"By 2020, with Klabin SA's new growth projects, our goal was not to increase Scope 3 emissions by more than 5% over the 2017 base year, which would total emissions of 184,136.50 tCO2eq. We consider this target to have been met, since we managed to keep the increase below 5%, having a 2% increase in 2020.This year, 2020, we reduced upstream diesel emissions by 7% compared to 2017, the year in which the target was set, from optimizing the raw material transportation routes to the production plants. However, there was a 20% increase in emissions related to the distribution of products to our customers. With the achievement of the target for the year, this target has been revised.In addition, Klabin is restructuring its supplier evaluation process based on a new sustainability assessment in the organization's supply chain. Once we have reached the target year, Since we have reached the base year, we are making a gradual evaluation of suppliers and their results in sustainability, with the objective of together building new targets to, for example, reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the supply chain. To reaffirm our commitment to implement actions to combat climate change, Klabin is the first Brazilian company in the forestry, pulp and paper sector to take part in the ""Companies in Action"" initiative of validating our targets based on Science-Based Targets.Science-based targets provide companies with a clearly defined path to future-proof growth, specifying how much and how quickly they need to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions."
"KCC aims at reducing average CO2 emissions per vessel to 17,700 mt in 2022, a reduction of 15% vs. actual 2018,  and achieve carbon neutral operations in 2030. The difference between actual performance and zero (carbon neutrality) in 2030 will be offset by burning bio-fuel on all or part of the fleet and possibly by buying carbon offsets.  KCC aims at exceeding the IMO target of 50% reduction in total emissions in 2050 vs 2008, with an ambition to reach zero-emission operations within 2050 aligned with the Paris Agreement's long term goal to keep the rise in global average temperature well below 2°C.  The targeted reduction in 2030 CO2 emissions may be achieved partly by improving the energy efficiency of the fleet, partly through improving the operational efficiency and partly through burning fuels with lower carbon footprint. Average CO2 emissions per vessel increased from 19,900mt in 2019 to 20,700 mt in 2020. Absolute emissions per vessel were negatively impacted by amongst others poor energy efficiency of some vessels coming close to docking. These vessels have been docked during second half of 2020 or will be docked in 2021. The 2020 performance shows yet limited positive effects from ongoing energy efficiency initiatives under testing or in early phase of implementation. We expect to see results from these initiatives in 2021."
"KCC aims as stated under target Abs 1 to be carbon neutral in 2030 and here stated in target Abs 2 to reach zero-emission operations within 2050.  The targeted reduction in CO2 emissions may be achieved partly by improving the energy efficiency of the fleet, partly through improving the operational efficiency and partly through burning fuels with no carbon footprint and KCC has an ambition to order a zero-emission vessel prior to 2030.  Average CO2 emissions per vessel increased from 19,900mt in 2019 to 20,700 mt in 2020. Absolute emissions per vessel were negatively impacted by amongst others poor energy efficiency of some vessels coming close to docking.

"Klépierre's ambition, certified SBTi is to reduce Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions 80% per sq.m by 2030 from a 2017 base-year. This corresponds to a 74% change in absolute emissions for the same scope.  This objective  was already set in 2018 as part of a wider carbon neutral goal (scope 1 & 2, market-based), but was  refined this year when submitting it to the Science Based initiative.Our Scope 1 and 2 (market-based) target is also to achieve a zero carbon emissions portfolio by 2030 through to 2050.Calculation details:- Scope 1 + 2 emissions: 2017 : 83,969 tCO2e 2020: 20,883 tCO2e- tCO2e reduced so far: 83,969 - 20,883  = 63,086 tCO2e- tCO2e that have to be reduced by 2030 : 83,969 - (1-0,74)*83,969 = 62,137 tCO2e- % achieved : 63,086/ 62,137  = 102%"
"Klépierre's second new ambition, certified SBTi is to reduce GHG emissions in transport, from visitors and customers at its shopping centers, by 55% per visitor by 2030.

"Klépierre's third new ambition, certified SBTi is to reduce GHG emissions for its tenanted space by at least 3% per square meter per year over the 2017-2030 target period. This corresponds to a 46% change in absolute emissions for the scope 3 tenanted space category.Calculation details:- Scope 3 emissions from downstream leased assets: 2017: 311,850 tCO2e 2020: 108,309 tCO2e- tCO2e reduced so far: 311,850 - 108,309= 202,541tCO2e- tCO2e that have to be reduced by 2030: 311,850 - 311,850x(1-0,46) = 143,451tCO2e- % achieved: 202,541 / 143,451= 142%"
We went 80% solar in 2016 (Scope 1). Our average CO2 emission REDUCTION is 490 tons annually for the past 3.5 years. Our goal is to achieve 600 tons emission REDUCTION in 2022.
"The original formulation of the target is the following: By 2025, Klövern's property management shall be climate neutral. As it describes, the target covers the property management which is also the core of Klövern's business operations and covers all of Klövern's currently calculated  scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions.  Klövern has applied for Science Based Targets but has not yet been approved.  We consider this a science based target as carbon neutrality is a crucial step to be able to limit global warming to 1.5°C. This target is also reported as a net-zero target (reference number NZ1)."
Kmart Group operates under Wesfarmers Limited's (parent company) Climate Change Policy. This commits its retail businesses to achieve Net Zero by 2030 in scopes 1 + 2.
"We have committed through the Fashion Industry Charter for Climate Action to achieve a 30 per cent aggregate GHG emission reductions in scope 1, 2 and 3 of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Standard by 2030, against a baseline of no earlier than 2015. This year we've estimated the scope 3 emissions from all relevant categories for the first time to check for materiality and guide focus on reduction activities. Further to this we have engaged a consultant to assist us in developing subordinate absolute and/or intensity targets to pursue against the material category of Scope 3 emission (category 1). We continue to work towards declaring a baseline for scope 3 and have consultants engaged to prepare this to aid our commitments."
"By July 2025, we will achieve 20 per cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions (from 2018 baseline) from our owned and controlled operations (stores, distribution centres and offices)."
"Knorr-Bremse recognizes climate change as one of the most pressing challenges of our time. As a manufacturing company with global value chains, Knorr-Bremse attaches particular importance to climate protection. For this reason, we have set ourselves ambitious targets that are aligned with the requirements of climate science for successfully limiting global warming to a maximum of 1.5°C in accordance with the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement. To realize this commitment, Knorr-Bremse aims to halve its global CO2 emissions from its global locations and vehicle fleet (scope 1+2) until 2030. This means an absolute reduction of CO2 emissions by 4,2% per year compared to the base year 2018. Sub objectives regarding energy efficiency, expansion of own renewable generation capacities and maximizing sourcing of renewable energies will be defined in 2021 and disclosed in the upcoming reporting period."

"In 2008, Kohl's became the first retailer to announce a commitment to reach net zero U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, as part of the company's ongoing partnership with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Climate Leaders program. We initially set a target (Abs2) focused on energy efficiency and location-based means to reduce our GHG footprint by 20% for Scope 1 and 2 emissions combined by 2020 based on a 2008 base year, achieving the goal one year early in 2019 (see below).In September 2019, Kohl's announced a set of sustainability goals focused on climate action, waste and recycling, and sustainable sourcing that support the sustainable future we see for our customers and associates. The company's sustainability strategy is guided by leveraging business practices and decisions that enhance the objectives of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).Our climate action goals are focused on the reduction of greenhouse emissions and increase of renewable energy use. This includes a Scope 1 and 2 combined goal of 50% reduction from 2014 levels by 2025; seeking an approximate linear decrease in emissions of 4.55% year-on-year. This linear reduction is more ambitious than SBTi's absolute contraction for 1.5DC of 4.2% year-on-year. In 2021, Kohl's has committed to setting a science-based target that will be approved by the Science-Based Targets initiative."
"Location-based Scope 1 and 2 emissions in 2017 were 567,722; therefore, Kohl's has reduced emissions by 32% from the 2008 base year. Realized emissions reductions in 2017 exceeded Kohl's 2020 goal, 20% reduction target by 60%. Location-based scope 1 and 2 emissions in 2018 were 553,933; therefore, Kohl's has now reduced emissions by 34% from the 2008 base year.  In 2019, we enhanced our approach and developed a new target that is more ambitious than the 1.5DS absolute contraction goal (see previous target). This goal is part of our commitment to the White House American Business Act on Climate Pledge signed in 2015 that supports the Paris Agreement."
"The KII's science-based goal is to calculate the potential for reduction. Currently, it does not officially join SBTi to respond. However, KII is pushing for a strategy to reduce shortfall through potential reduction by comparing the government's allocation target with expected emissions, and will officially join SBTi soon. Through this process, KII reduces GHG by 5% of its average total emissions per year, and some implementation tasks are certified by the government and are allocated additional emissions. It is expected to cut about 3,000 tons by 2030, and some of the cuts are being reviewed with external agencies."
"This target is set to reduce CO2 emission that products we sold at customers site, because CO2 emission of product use occupies approximately 90% of all. And this target was approved by the SBTi on April 2017. Our target progressed nicely in reporting year, as a result of activities based on our internal target of 50% CO2 reduction for product use by 2030 (in comparison with 2010)."
KBN's minimum 50 % reduction in its emission + net zero goal is aligned with the well-below 2°C target
"KONE has set Science Based Targets for significant reductions in its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by the year 2030. We have committed to a 50% cut in the emissions from its own operations (Scope 1 and 2 emissions) by 2030, compared to a 2018 baseline. This target is in line with limiting global warming to 1.5°C."
"KONE has over 1,000 facilities globally, including office spaces and installation and service operation hubs. Our facilities accounted for approximately 25% of the carbon footprint of our own operations (Scope 1 and 2) in 2020. We have a Global Facility Policy,  approved by KONE's Executive Board, which aims at a harmonized approach in the selection and management of our facilities, developing fit-for-purpose facilities and eco-efficient operations, and providing a safe and secure work environment for KONE employees. According to the policy, our target is to reduce our facility-related carbon footprint by 15% by 2022 (base year 2017)."
"Carbon Footprint Emissions 2019: 14.373,03 tn CO2"
"Carbon Footprint Emissions 2020: 11.109,46 tn CO2"
"We have been aiming to cut our own CO2 emissions by 20 per cent by the end of 2020, based on the figures for 2015. We  achieved our goal. During 2021, we will set new goals for the period through to 2030. The target covered our Scope 1 and 2 emissions, and business travel in Scope 3."
"This goal (EcoVision 2050) is set for all of the greenhouse gas emissions (product life cycle CO2 emissions) emitted from Konica Minolta's business activities. We also set targets to realize ""carbon minus"" by collaborating with stakeholders to create a reduction effect that exceeds CO2 emissions in the product life cycle (out of scope 1, 2, 3)."
We submitted this quantitative goal in December 2016. This goal was approved by SBTi in February 2017.
"We have newly set this target in the Medium-Term sustainability Plan 2022, which plays a central role in DX2022 medium-term management plan that started in fiscal 2020."
"DSM's Scope 1 + 2 target is a 50% absolute reduction by 2030 versus 2016.In 2021, DSM increased its GHG emissions reductions target for scope 1+2 for 2030, moving from a target level of 30% to 50% absolute reduction by 2030 (versus 2016 baseline). The update brings DSM in line with the well-below 2?C trajectory, building on the good reduction progress so far. In 2020, baseline GHG emissions figure of 2016 (1.50 million tons CO2eq) was increased to 1.65 million tons CO2eq, due to the inclusion of eight acquired sites in our reporting scope for the period 2017–2020 and the impact of methodology changes. Three newly built sites were also added to the reporting scope, however as they were constructed after 2016, have no impact on the baseline correction.The absolute reduction in scope 1 + 2 GHG emissions was 25% compared to the corrected baseline of 2016. We estimate that of the 25% absolute reduction in scope 1 + 2 GHG emissions compared to baseline 2016, 18% is due to structural improvements. This is due to projects in our greenhouse gas reduction program, ranging from relatively easy-to-implement modifications in operations, such as improving the insulation around hot parts, to installing advanced energy metering systems, up to the installation of best available technologies (for example, heating and cooling equipment). The contribution to our GHG reductions due to the step-up in renewably sourced electricity that was made in Europe and North America in 2020, was offset by the current growth in non-renewably sourced electricity in China. This growth in China was due to the impact of acquisitions as well as organic growth in our China sites."
"TargetThis target is part of our approach to realize 100% scope 1 and 2 emission reduction. The primary step in reducing  CO? emissions is to reduce the energy consumption (trias energetica). We have an ambition to reduce our energy consumption with 55% in 2030 compared to our baseyear.   While data communication and the use of our ICT services are growing exponentially (on average 37% each year) KPN's energy consumption has decreased with 37% compared to baseyear 2010 These figures can also be found in our Annual Report 2020 page 57 and page 213 in Appendix 7, Table 1.Target progress is measured in gross scope 1 en scope 2 location based emissions. More than 98% of our scope 1 & 2 CO?e emissions are in scope (result of our materiality assessment). This is also mentioned in IAR 2020 page 213 header) Restate 2019 and baseyear2019 emissions Scope 1+2 (location based) were 282,600 ton. This is also mentioned in the table on page 5 of Annual Report 2019: CO?e emissions own operations Scope 1 and 2 (in kTon). Due to new Dutch reporting principles the CO? conversion factor of the gridmix is increased from 413 to 475 g CO?e/kWh.  2020 is calculated with 475g and previous years are restated. This is also mentioned  in Annual Report 2020 Appendix 3 page 185.  So 2019 emissions are restated from 282,642 into 321,082 ton.  Compared to baseyear 2010, restated into 405,732 ton, this is a 20.9% reduction in 2019. So % completion against target in 2019 is (restated) 20.9/55 = 38,0%. Result 20202020 emissions Scope 1+2 (location based) are 290,350 ton. This figure can also be found in the table on page 57 of Annual Report 2020: CO?e emissions own operations Scope 1 and 2 (in kTon).Compared to baseyear 2010, this is a 28.4% reduction.

"Target We have net zero scope 1 emissions since 2015 (with offsetting taken into account). From 2030 and further we intend to have zero scope 1 emissions without offsetting. Currently we compensate with Gold Standard certificates. So as from 2030 our gross scope 1 emissions will be zero. This will be accomplished by: 1) As from 2025 only inflow of new cars which have zero emission; 2) migrate to bio-fuels and bio-based cooling fluids. or electric cars This target is approved by SBTi on 13th February 2017. The SBTi technical team and the SBTi Steering Committee have approved the submitted target on reduction of gross scope 1 emissions. This target is part of our approved science based target to have zero gross Scope1 emissions and zero scope 2 market based emissions as from 2030. Cars are responsible for ~70% of our Scope1 emissions. Depending on the developments in the car-sector our cars will be using bio-gas, electricity or hydro-power. To stay on track we have short term targets for 2021 on car fuel consumption (70% compared to baseyear).

We target a reduction of 17.5 % from our gross-global Scope1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions, over a period of 7 years, which translates to 2.50 % reduction per year on average. The target is also checked using the target setting tool of SBTi, which resulted in the same reduction figure to be in line with the IEA WB2C using the absolute contraction approach. Although it seems like we have achieved this target, we will keep monitoring this target until the target year, as some of our GHG emissions have reduced due to Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, and the emission figure in 2020 does not represent our normal level of operations."
"The target covers all our gross-global Scope1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions.

"The average emission between 2007 and 2011 was 2,834,628 tons, and the target emission for 2026 is 6,179,630 tons. The estimation in 2007 was based on 14 branches including the Headquarter, and it is expanded to 16 branches including Pangyo and Samsong branches in 2011. Recently, we saw an increase in the number of branches with four news branches (i.e., Gwanju-Jeonnam, Pyeongtaek, Sejong, The Frontier Research and Training Institute) have been added. This figure reflects the expansion of new high-capacity power plants and heat supply areas compared to the base year, and the direct comparison of the total emission in the base year is not reasonable. The overall target is set up based on the 2050 Roadmap toward Carbon Neutrality, and more specification on the target will be further discussed when the SBT criteria become clearly identified in two years."

"KEPCO greenhouse gas reduction target is the same as the one submitted in 2019, and various activities are being carried out with the goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 2020."
"Along with the introduction of the K-ETS system in 2015, KOGAS was designated as a subject company for allocation, and has therefore been systematically managing GHGs emissions and reporting them to the government. In order to achieve the national emission reduction target, we have established our own emission target, and are carrying out reduction activities to achieve the target every year."
"Korea announced a target to reduce greenhouse gas by 37% (approximately 211 million tCO2e) compared to BAU by 2030 at COP21 held in Paris. In a response to the national target, KOEN has established ‘2030 GHGs Emissions Reduction Roadmap' which includes the emissions reduction target (35% reduction by 2030 compared to BAU). In order to achieve the national reduction target, the power generation sector must reduce about 19.9% GHGs emissions. In addition, we have actively introduced emissions reduction technologies such as conversion of byproduct of coal into raw material and fuel switch to biomass, and are researching and developing additional reduction technologies that can be applied in the future. Regarding renewable energy, we are expanding business areas focusing on internal or SPC investment projects, and planning to lead new markets by novel project models in the sector of photovoltaic and wind power."
"Although the science-based target (SBT) initiative verification was not carried out, KOSPO's greenhouse gas reduction target was set in consideration of the SBT requirement level.KOSPO must reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 45% over 13 years from the base year of 2017 to the target year of 2030. This is a figure that requires an average annual reduction of 3.46%, which is a level that corresponds to a significantly lower level of conformance target (2.5% ? X < 4.2%) than 2? among the carbon-neutral target setting standards suggested by the Science-Based Target Initiative."
"Estimated GHG emission was 36,970,000 tCO2e in 2017, the changed target of energy sector according to the changed version of national target (37% of BAU) has been applied. In 2017 KOWEPO amended 'Low Carbon Management Master-plan' following by national target setting renewal for 2030 NDC's targeting accomplishment. KOWEPO's also revision its master-plan every year with internal group evaluation, and those analysis continuously showed that KOWEPO has GHG reduction potential on 1) New and Renewable energy, 2) Plants Re-powering, 3) Fuel Transition, 4) Performance Improvement, 5) CCUS development, and 6) External GHG reduction projects. If Korea's upgraded 2030 NDC is decided on an absolute basis in October 2021, the 'Low Carbon Management Master-Plan' will be revised by 2022."
"Since 2015, Korean Air has been complying with Korean-ETS which covers scope 1 and 2 emissions from domestic flight operations and ground facilities. According to regulations of Korean-ETS, the target level equals the number of free allocations which is 97% of baseline emissions. And target reduction percentages are determined based on the NDC of South Korea and the industry's BAU emissions, which were designed well below 2°C aligned.  Due to COVID-19, the 2020 emission decreased drastically, reducing emissions far below the target."
"The aviation industry had adopted a market-based mechanism called CORSIA(Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation) to maintain international aviation's global net CO2 emissions at a stable level of 2019(baseline). In any year starting in 2021, any CO2 emissions covered by the scheme that exceed the average baseline emissions for baseline must be offset by purchasing carbon credits from the market. Due to the COVID-19, the emission level decreased below the baseline emission, resulting in 0 offset requirement for the year 2020. Korean Air's Scope 1 emissions from international flights are covered under CORSIA which consists of 94% of the company's total Scope 1 emissions."
"In support of our commitment to sustainability, Korn Ferry has set a target to reduce total Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 30% over a 6-year period, compared to its 2019 emissions. This is a science-based target aligned with the Paris Agreement's goal of limiting global temperature increase to within 1.5 degrees Celsius, and we expect our new target to inform decisions related to our global office footprint over the coming years."
Our target is to become carbon neutral across our operations for Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 2030 or sooner.
"Our Science Based Target is to reduce carbon emissions associated with Scope 1 and 2 emissions is to be zero by 2030. Our 2017 baseline carbon footprint was 6,298 tonnes, our reported carbon footprint this year is 3,397 tonnes which represents a 46% reduction vs the baseline. However, our operations have been effected by COVID so we are not able to account for this reduction purely through our reduction initiatives."
"Our Science Based Target is to reduce carbon emissions associated by Purchased Goods and Services by 25% by 2030 compared to our 2017 baseline. Our calculated carbon footprint for purchased goods and services in 2017 was 153,962 tonnes. Our reported scope 3 emissions associated with purchased goods and services for 2020 is 128, 873 tonnes. This means that we've reduced our Scope 3 emissions by 16.3% since the 2017 baseline. However due to the COVID pandemic some of this reduction will be due to the changes in working practice associated with COVID."
"This target is to implement 2 collaboration projects per year with our suppliers to help reduce emissions. KPMG have been working closely with suppliers, encouraging them to share collaboration projects through CDP Supply Chain and during supplier meetings to enable us to reduce emissions together."
"This is a supply chain target. KPMG have set a target of 2020, 80% of KPMG in the UK's strategic suppliers will be reporting their scope 1 and/or Scope 2 emissions and report emissions reductions."
Kroger's 2030 greenhouse gas reduction target applies to the enterprise.
The climate target and the emission figures cover all emissions from operations of all subsidiaries that have a production facility on site.  Smaller representations or sales offices were not evaluated material due to very low emission figures. The target covers at least 95 % of the worldwide Scope 1/2 emissions from KRONES Group's operations.
The target covers all Scope 3 categories while two of the categories (purchased goods and services + lifetime-use of sold products) account for more than 90 percent of the overall Scope 3 emissions. This is why the focus of the reduction measures lies on reducing the product carbon footprint of our products.
"KT has been able to accurately measure, report, and verify the range of 1 and 2 emissions data for 100% operating range through the establishment of a greenhouse gas inventory system in 2009 and the recent improvement of the system. This range consists of more than 300,000 telecommunication businesses and telecommunication equipment such as relays currently managed by KT, and KT's mid-term goal is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 35% in 2030 compared to 2007. The medium-term objective was established based on the results of scenario analysis using NDC and the reduction level required by CDP. KT's goal is not a science-based goal, but it is expected to be set within the next two years. The objective is reported to CDP 2020 and identification number is Abs 1. The 2007-2010 Scope 1 and 2 data were verified by the British Standard Institute (BSI) and the 2011-2020 data were verified by the Korea Quality Assurance (KQA)."

"Target is setted up by Government. They analyzed our emission amount(2014~16) and calculate average emission. After then, they added a reduction factor(about 6%) and allocate to companies. This factor-applied emission value is target of GHG emission next year.But, SBTi application is considered after due consideration."
"Since the company is in an adjustment period, it can only achieve 85.6% of the target."
"In 2020, we set a Scope 1 + 2 target with FY2019 as the base year and FY2030 as the target year.FY2019 is 04/01/2019 to 31/03/2020. Therefore, we have entered 2020 as the base year, which is the end of FY2019. FY2030 is 04/01/2030 to 31/03/2031. Therefore, we have entered 2031 as the target year, which is the end of FY2030."

FY2020 Scope 3 emissions have achieved the FY2030 target ahead of schedule. This is mainly due to the decrease in ""Use of sold products (category 11)"", which accounts for the majority of Scope 3 of the Group.Most of category 11 is rotating equipment such as pumps, motors, and blowers, and the sales volume of these equipment will increase or decrease depending on the content of the order. Therefore, we will not review the target and base year at this time, but will confirm and analyze the transition from the next fiscal year onward and consider revisions."

"We have been committed to fighting climate change for many years, both within our company – we reduced the CO2 emissions of our operations by 81%, in absolute terms, from 2005 to 2020 – and in our value chain. This was achieved on a 29% increase in production compared with 2005, demonstrating the Group's ability to decorrelate its growth from its environmental impact.In the frame of the COP21 in November 2015, we signed the SBTi commitment letter to implement Science-Based Targets within our activities. The SBTi validated our 2030 target in December 2017. This new carbon reduction commitment brought us one step further in our mid and long-term journey towards a low-carbon business model, addressing our global impacts and contributing to the 1.5° scenario confirmed by the Paris Agreement.We commit to reduce our absolute Scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions 25% by 2030, from a 2016 base year. In support of this goal, we will reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 emissions at our operated sites 100% by 2025, from a 2016 base year. By the end of 2020, thanks to energy efficiency management and renewable energy solutions, 72 of our sites are carbon neutral: 19 factories, 31 distribution centres, 18 administrative sites and 4 research centres (of which 24 new carbon neutral sites in 2020). A site claims the status of ""carbon neutral"", if it meets the following two requirements:- Direct CO2 (Scope 1) = 0, with the exception of the gas used for catering, the fuel oil used for sprinklers tests or maintenance, and cooling gas leaks if they are lower than 150 tonnes CO2eq/year;- Indirect CO2 Market-Based (Scope 2) = 0, i.e. supplied with 100% renewable energy (the renewable energy sources must be located on site or less than 500 km from the site and be connected to the same distribution network).In May 2019, in response to the IPCC's Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C, the SBTi reviewed the level of ambition of our approved Scope 1 and Scope 2 target. The target covering GHG emissions from L'Oréal's Scopes 1 and 2 is consistent with reductions required to keep warming to 1.5°C, the most ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement.In September 2019, L'Oréal joined the UN's Business Ambition for 1.5°C initiative and committed to achieving net zero emissions of CO2 by 2050, thereby contributing to maintaining global warming to below 1.5°C, compared to preindustrial levels."
"In 2015, L'Oréal undertook to define Science Based Targets to reduce its GHG emissions across its entire value chain and over the long term, in accordance with the Paris Climate Agreement. In December 2017, the SBT initiative validated the Group's proposal: we commit to reduce our absolute Scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions 25% by 2030, from a 2016 base year. In support of this goal, we will reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 emissions at our operated sites 100% by 2025, from a 2016 base year.This brought L'Oréal one step further in the long-term journey towards a low-carbon business model, addressing our global impacts; with our commitments considered to be in compliance with the new SBTi 1.5°C criteria in 2019. All the ''Métiers” (Packaging, R&I, Sourcing, etc.) are working on their own Scopes 1, 2 and 3 decarbonation and a specific tracking is progressively deployed internally to monitor each performance. In September 2019, L'Oréal joined the UN's Business Ambition for 1.5°C initiative and committed to achieving net zero emissions of CO2 by 2050.Each year, specific work is carried out on all the Scope 3 categories of the GHG assessment in order to improve its input data, perimeters and emission factors. In the process of ensuring the relevance of our progress towards the target, we update the baseline for Scope 3 in compliance with the GHG Protocol guidelines that we use for Scope 1 and 2 baseline management; allowing us to separate technical evolutions, business growth and performance of the ''Métiers”.Taking into account this baseline management process, the variation between the covered emissions in base year disclosed in the CDP 2018 and the figure disclosed this year is explained by several improvements to allow us to be on a like-for-like basis for a whole performance management (cf. Universal Registration Document 2020, p197).For 2020, L'Oréal's Scope 3 is estimated at 11,169 thousand tonnes CO2eq, representing a reduction of around 0.5 million tonnes compared to 2019, primarily due to Covid-19 health crisis, which particularly impacts the following Scope 3 items: products and services purchased, business travel, employee commuting, etc. The CO2 emissions linked to the use of sold products declined proportionally less in 2020 than the Group's business activities, with more rinsed-off products (Hygiene, Hair Care) than non-rinsed-off products (Makeup)."
"L'Oréal set in 2009 a reduction goal of -50% in 2015 with a 2005 baseline for factories and distribution centres (Operations). At the end of 2015, L'Oréal went further than this goal, reaching a -56% of CO2 emissions reduction. The Sharing Beauty With All programme has set in 2013 a new ambitious target of -60% reduction in 2020 with the same 2005 baseline. The baseline is managed and revised according to the GHG Protocol, and takes into account new acquisitions and divestments. In 2016, this objective has been converted from a ""net objective"" into a ""Market-Based"" objective, following the evolution of the GHG Protocol; this ''Market-Based” approach has also been applied to the 2005 baseline. Through a continuous improvement approach, in 2016, the reporting of Scope 1 emissions has been improved by taking into account at Operations level the emissions coming from cooling gas leaks. In 2016, the ''Working Sustainably” programme has been launched for our administrative and research sites (see target below Abs 4). By 2016, the 2020 target had been exceeded, with a 67% reduction in emissions. End of 2020, the GHG emissions of Operations sites (which represents 82% of the total Scope 1 and 2 in 2020) have been reduced by 81% compared to 2005, in absolute terms, while increasing the production by 29% at the same time, thereby confirming that ambitious commitment in favour of the climate can go hand-in-hand with economic success.L'Oréal has drafted a strategy involving the use of renewable energy, based on the possibilities offered by each local context. In recent years, many projects have been rolled-out, and allow some sites to directly produce their own renewable energy, implement PPAs (Power Purchase Agreements), or use locally produced renewable energy. In 2020, 72% of the energy consumed by the plants and distribution centres is renewable.L'Oréal has been also committed for over 20 years in energy efficiency through ongoing improvement of industrial processes and equipment performance, and optimization of the energy consumption in the buildings. This policy led to a 33% decline in consumption in plants and distribution centres,  in kWh per 1,000 finished products between 2005 and 2020. In 2015, an ISO 50001 ''Energy Management” certification programme was launched at Group level. As of the end of 2020, 27 factories had been ISO 50001 certified (69%)."
"In 2016, a new programme called ''Working Sustainably” has been launched within our Sharing Beauty with All programme, giving the objective for each of our administrative and research sites to reduce, with a 2016 baseline, its waste generation, water and energy consumption by 20%, and its CO2 emissions by 60% in 2020. These sites also commit to use 100% of renewable electricity by 2020. Thanks to this new ''Working Sustainably” programme, 100% of L'Oréal Scope 1 and 2 emissions have 2020 reduction goals. This is a Market-Based objective; it also takes into account the GHG emissions coming from cooling gas leaks. The 2016 baseline is managed and revised according to the GHG protocol, and takes into account new acquisitions and divestments.By the end of 2020, the GHG emissions of administrative and research sites (which represents 18% of the total Scope 1 and 2 in 2020) have been reduced by 76% compared to 2016, in absolute terms. Moreover, these sites reached a 76% renewable energy use (of which a 90% renewable electricity), with a 34% energy consumption increase per 100 hours worked between 2016 and 2020:- In 2020, the 76% reduction in CO2 was achieved thanks to the decrease in energy consumption and the increased use of renewable energy for a large number of administrative sites and research centres. In fact, energy consumption was down 15% from 2019, and the share of renewable energy rose to 76% (compared to 54% in 2019). These results demonstrate the mobilisation of the teams in contributing to the ambition of the Group in the field of climate change. In addition to the improvement projects in place, which continued in 2020, the Covid-19 health crisis also had a favourable impact on this result due to the lower number of hours spent on-site by teams.- The administrative sites and research centres also pursued the Group's energy efficiency approach, obtaining a 21% drop in total energy consumption in kWh between 2016 and 2020. However, the Covid-19 health crisis resulted in a decrease of 41% in hours worked on these sites compared with 2016, with the result of a 34% increase in the consumption of the administrative sites and research centres in kWh per 100 hours worked between 2016 and 2020. In 2020, some administrative sites and research centres have initiated the ISO 50001 ''Energy Management” certification process."
"L'Oréal Chairman and CEO announced in 2015 that the Group would completely balance its CO2 emissions from production and finished goods transportation by 2020, to become a carbon-balanced company.The Group now pursues a twofold approach to reduce its carbon footprint:1. Reducing emissions linked to its industrial activities by 60% by 2020, from a 2005 baseline, through the increasing use of renewable energy and improvements in the energy efficiency of its industrial sites (see objective above Abs 3);2. Counterbalancing by 2020 the rest of its emissions by generating carbon gains through the sustainable sourcing of raw materials in partnership with its suppliers, supporting them in their low carbon transition process. With this new ambition, L'Oréal aims to balance its incompressible CO2 emissions (around 400,000 tonnes per year). This innovative approach is rolled-out through a range of projects with three focal points: improving energy efficiency, promoting low-carbon agriculture, developing sustainable forestry projects.To ensure its approach is effective, L'Oréal has put together an expert committee of independent carbon specialists. This target covers 100% of emissions in Scope 1, Scope 2, and downstream transportation of products in Scope 3. It covers medium timeframe so as to completely counterbalance its CO2 emissions from production by 2020, and continue until 2030 within the scope of our Science-Based Targets.In 2020, it was estimated that the nine energy and forestry projects in place generated carbon savings of 405,241 tonnes CO2 equivalent, thus achieving our 2020 target. Identification of CO2 hotspots in raw materials supply chains, scoping studies, training webinars and call for project proposals have been set up and shared with suppliers. Statutory Auditors verified all data related to the Carbon Balanced programme at the end of 2020.NB: The percentage of target achieved in 2020 is negative because we have exceeded the planned target by generating more carbon savings than the carbon emissions on the considered perimeter."
"Replaced with Abs 3. During the transitional period from the merger to the end of calendar year 2019, legacy Harris Corporation environmental sustainability goals acted as the interim targets for all L3Harris sites and facilities in 2019. As part of our merger, re-base-lining work conducted in 2019 included collecting combined data for L3 Technologies and Harris Corporation to determine our emissions for a new baseline year as a combined company. This target served as the transitional period target for the combined company."
"This target replaces target Abs 2.  The ‘Covered emissions in the ‘reporting year' field of this target include total emissions for L3Harris, which includes the combined data for L3 Technologies and Harris Corporation.  This target was developed using the tool created by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) and meets the science-based level of ambition criteria required to limit the global temperature increase to 2.0°C, using the absolute contraction approach. The target has not yet been verified by the SBTi."
"In 2015, within the framework of the COP 21 in Paris, La Banque Postale and Le Groupe La Poste (the parent company of La Banque Postale) announced its ambition to reduce its CO2 emissions by 20% in 2020 compared with 2013. The target covers 100% of our 2013 Scopes 1 + 2 + 3 (paper, business travel, employees commuting).At the end of 2020, the reduction reached 32% over the 2013-2020 period, and exceeded the initial 20% reduction target.To ensure that La Banque Postale's emissions reduction target is relevant and aligned with the ambitions of the Paris Climate Agreement signed during the COP 21, La Banque Postale signed upto the ''Science Based Target” (SBT) initiative in 2017. The SBT initiative aims to establish the guidelines for the financial sector and to define a trajectory compatible with a scenario of +1.5°C by 2100. La Banque Postale was involved in all the preliminary phases, coordinated by the WWF, the co-founder of the SBT, and led by the secretariat of the SBT. After publication of the methodologies that have applied to the sector since October 2020, 2021 will be devoted to their implementation within the organisation.In addition, La Banque Postale announced in September 2020 its ambition to achieve net-zero emissions by 2040, i.e. 10 years before the recommendation of the Paris Agreement."
"In 2016, La Banque Postale set up a target to reduce the CO2 emissions from energy use in its buildings. This target is aligned with the Bank's 2016-2022 strategic plan:-5% in 2017 (achieved)-10% in 2018 (target exceeded: -12% achieved)-15% in 2020 (achieved)-20% in 2020 (underway)La Banque Postale's CO2 emissions from buildings fell by 68% between 2013 and 2020.  In 2020, building emissions totaled 16 186 tCO2, a 7% decrease compared with 2019. This reduction was achieved thanks to the switch to renewable energy from 2016 on, and thanks to the energy management policy (ISO 50001)."
"La Poste set a science-based target for its Scope 1 + 2 in August 2019. This target, which was approuved by the SBTi, covers all building under management of Poste Immo (La Poste Real Estate Management entity), which includes the Post offices. The Post offices are shared facilities between La Poste and La Banque Postale. According to internal agreement, the CO2 emissions from the post offices are shared between La Poste and La Banque Postale. La Banque Postale's share is 50.6 %.According to the target, the absolute scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions is 51% by 2025 from a 2013 base year. This target is consistent with reductions required to keep warming to 1.5°C.Extract from the press release(11 October 2019) La Poste reinforced its commitment to reduce its environmental footprint and the groupe ambition's is to reduce its CO2 emissions by 30%   by 2025, compared to 2013. ''Sciences-Based Targets "", the UN initiative led by 4 international NGOs, has just approved thisobjective and declare it scientifically compliant with the Paris Agreement.Target coverage extends only to La Poste's buildings"
"This target was submitted to the science based target initiative and is currently under review. La Banque Postale's buidings can be split into 2 categories: -Those shared with La Poste and under management of Poste Immo (La Poste's real estate management entity), which are already covered by an SBT target (-51% in 2025 compared with 2013, which is consistent with reductions required to keep warming to 1.5°C). -Those not shared with La Poste which are covered by this reduction target of 46.2% in 2030 compared with 2019 (SDA methodology, and with reductions required to keep warming to 1.5°C).The two targets combined enable La Banque Postale to cover 100 % of its buildings."
"This target was submitted to the science based target initiative and is currently under review. This target covers 100% of La Banque Postale's vehicules fleet.This target is based on the SDA methodology, and is consistent with reductions required to keep warming to 1.5°C."
"Please note that the target is ending to 2020, linked to '2015-2020 Group strategic plan', updated in 2017, from -15% to -20% and already achieved.see below the new 2025 La Poste SA's target.  The Science Based Targets initiative has assessed La Poste SA's official submissions against the Call to Action's eligibility criteria and, after careful review has approved the targets. La Poste SA's target submission for scope 1 and 2 emissions is a reduction of absolute emissions 51% by 2025 from a 2013 base year, which exceeds the minimum ambition for a 1.5°C pathway defined by the Absolute Contraction approach and is therefore considered ambitious. La Poste SA's target submission for scope 3 emissions is a reduction of absolute emissions 14% by 2025 from a 2013 base year, which exceeds the minimum ambition for 2°C pathway defined by the Sector Decarbonisation Approach and is therefore also considered ambitious. Please note that Le Groupe La Poste is divided into many different entities. This target applies to La Poste SA (mail, parcels, retail and digital business units) : it covers 100 % of Scope 1 + 2+ 3 emissions. This represent 46% of Le Groupe La Poste emissions (La Poste SA emissions and GeoPost Emissions).For Geopost Target, see below"

Labcorp established a divisional-level goal for LDD to reduce emissions 15% from 2014 to the end of 2020. LDD has achieved a 14.5% reduction of its Scope 1 and 2 emissions since 2014.
"In 2019, we worked with a third-party to evaluate our historical progress, forecast our future activity, and develop data-driven 2025 environmental goals for energy, climate, waste, and water. Our GHG emission target was developed to significantly reduce our environmental impact and transition towards a low-carbon economy.  These goals will ensure we remain focused on mitigating our key environmental impacts.  Our new absolute emission target was developed using a science-based target methodology; however, this target has not been submitted yet for approval by the Science-Based Target Initiative."

"The Lancashire Group's registered and head office is in Hamilton, Bermuda. The Group's second office is in London. We place the highest value on the relationships we have built over the years with our existing policyholders and work hard at creating a lasting impression with new ones. To this end, we are happy to welcome both our policyholders and their brokers to our offices, but we also travel to see them and their businesses around the world, as our business requires it. As a result, we are well aware that before the COVID-19 pandemic, the Lancashire Group incurred the bulk of its carbon footprint as a result of airline travel. We utilise a number of technologies to reduce inter-office travel, including full video and telephone conferencing facilities in all of our offices, including all of our meeting and Board rooms.In terms of an emissions target, we have established a travel policy to reduce our impact on the environment where possible whilst balancing the needs of our staff and Directors. Thus, our default position is not to book a business class airline ticket, if the duration of the flight is less than five hours long. Whilst we withhold the right to make exceptions to this rule, particularly in light of the changing needs around the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent impact on all travel, it is intended to assist the Group in managing one of its climate related risks, with a measurable target (i.e. the business travel section of our MGHG emissions report). Furthermore, the Group commits to continue to off-set 100% of its Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions, in order to remain Carbon Neutral.  We also seek to utilise electronic conferencing technology where possible and warranted from a business perspective to reduce the Group's travel requirement, whilst recognising the benefits of direct interactions."

"In 2019 we achieved our original 2030 SBT 11 years early, reducing our carbon intensity by 48% since 2014. In line with our aim to lead our sector, in 2019 we became the first UK REIT to increase the ambition level of our science-based carbon reduction target, aligning it to a 1.5-degree scenario (1.5DS). This commitment is one of several steps Landsec is taking to become a net zero carbon business by 2030.Our updated science-based target, now in line with the 1.5DS, is to reduce our absolute carbon emissions (tCO2e) by 70% by 2030 compared to a 2013/14 baseline, for property under our management for at least two years, excluding those properties which are acquired, sold or included in the development pipeline at any time within the last two years. We understand that this two-year period reflects the amount of time needed to undertake sustainability assessments and start implementing changes to the assets; once properties complete the minimum required time under our operational control, they will be included into the commitment portfolio at the start of the following reporting year. This target includes Scope 1 and 2 emissions, and Scope 3 emissions associated with downstream leased assets (gas and electricity procured by us and used by our occupiers) but excludes Scope 1 emissions associated with refrigerant gas. To develop this target, the Absolute Contraction Approach was adopted, which applies the annual emission reduction pathway aligned to a 1.5DS to the baseline emissions of the company, and the pathway is defined by a 4.2% annual linear reduction, which has been derived by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). We again worked with the Carbon Trust in order to calculate the emissions pathway for our SBT; the annual reduction aligned to the 1.5DS was applied to our baseline footprint, resulting in the absolute emissions pathway and reduction targets."

Lansinoh Laboratories Inc. commits to reduce absolute scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions 46% by 2030 from a 2019 base year. The targets covering greenhouse gas emissions from company operations (scopes 1 and 2) are consistent with reductions required to keep warming to 1.5°C.
"Our target setting approach: LANXESS has assessed its reduction targets based on the CDP criteria (published in the CDP's Technical Note on Science Based Targets). We concluded that the three targets together are sufficiently ambitious according to CDP. The targets apply to all of LANXESS' global business operations and cover 100% of GHG emissions (scope 1 and scope 2). After overachievement of existing targets, LANXESS set three new targets based on 2018 with ~3,200kt CO2e. In the meantime, more recent information is available, so that LANXESS has emitted 3,250kt CO2e for the year 2018. However, the targets will not be adjusted: 1. short term target is reduction of 3,200 kt CO2e in 2018 to 2,400 kt CO2e in 2025 (25% reduction of emissions; 4% reduction yoy); 2. mid-term target is reduction to 1,600 kt CO2e in 2030 (50% reduction of emissions; 8% reduction yoy); 3. long-term target is to become climate neutral until 2040 (>90% reduction of emissions; 15% reduction yoy). In order to become climate-neutral, the last emissions (< 300,000 tons) will be reduced through compensation measures.We came to the conclusion that the targets fulfils the requirements of the SBT and CDP approach."

"Our GHG reduction target was set in 2011 by our legacy company, SAIC, Inc. On September 27, 2013, SAIC, Inc. separated into two independent, publicly traded companies: New SAIC and Leidos. As part of the company split, we made specific real estate decisions to eliminate underperforming assets and improve operating efficiencies across the remaining real estate portfolio, with an emphasis on a flexible workplace. As a result, we achieved an absolute GHG reduction of 25.2% in 2013, exceeding our 2020 target six years early. In August 2016, Leidos merged with Lockheed Martin's Information Systems & Global Solutions business (IS&GS). This merger required the 2010 baseline GHG inventory to be recalculated and influenced corporate GHG reduction progress. Through 2020, we reduced GHG emissions 58% from our recalculated 2010 baseline, far exceeding our legacy emissions goal to reduce emissions 25% by 2020."

"In 2020 Leonardo set a new longer-termed target with a higher level of ambition. Leonardo's ambition is to reduce the Group's Scope 1 and Scope 2 (market-based) emissions by 40% in absolute terms. In 2020 Leonardo decided to replace the target Abs 1 with Abs 2, to have an emission reduction Scope 1 + Scope 2 of -40% by 2030. This change allows Leonardo to be in line with the criteria of Science-Based Targets initiative, covering a 10-year timeframe and an ambitious reduction towards decarbonisation.The increase of CO2 emissions in 2020 compared to 2019 is mainly due to greater use of gaseous substances (SF6) with high GWP during the manufacturing phase in the helicopters sector, that cannot be replaced so far due to technological constraints. However, Leonardo is carrying out study and plant modifications to implement a solution that will allow a significant reduction of CO2e emissions (estimated in about 165,000 met. ton.CO2e/year) and is implementing efficiency initiatives to support its decarbonisation strategy in line with the 40% reduction target."
"In 2019 Leonardo fixed a new absolute target at Company level based on the emissions savings expected to be achieved through several emission reduction activities to be implemented within a 5-year timeframe. Such target has a scope covering Scope 1+2 (market-based). In 2020 Leonardo decided to replace this target with Abs 2, to have an emission reduction Scope 1 + Scope 2 of -40% by 2030. This change allows Leonardo to be in line with the criteria of Science-Based Targets initiative, covering a 10-year timeframe and an ambitious reduction towards decarbonisation."

"SBTi approved our 2025 Science-Based Targets in July 2018. LS and Co. will work with its suppliers to reduce emissions totaling 40 percent of LS&Co.'s 2016 base year Category 1 emissions under Scope 3 by 2025. We have updated our methodology for Category 1 emissions to incorporate more of our emission reduction initiatives in our supply chain and better track our progress. We have also recalculated 2016 base year emissions. While LS&Co. has made significant improvements to our emission calculation methodology, this is a continuous improvement process and we will continue refining the methodology as more information becomes available. The reductions shown are due largely to change in sourcing mix and source base, as well as impacts from COVID."

"LG Co., Ltd. is managing absolute amount of annual status and reduction target of GHG emissions. For the purpose of CDP disclosure, GHG emissions of LG co. ltd. reflects its stake of stock for each of LG subsidiaries reported for this CDP disclosure. After the 1st Paris Agreement (COP21) came into effect in 2015, Republic of Korea established a roadmap for reducing GHG in conjunction with INDC and announced a revised roadmap for reducing GHG in July 2018. In addition, the 2030 GHG reduction target was set based on the absolute target value and submitted to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). As LG is in compliance with GHG target management system and ETS scheme in Korea, LG implemented scenario analysis to reflect NDC (Nationally Determined Contribution) of Korea for setting the corporate strategies of LG Group for GHG management and its business. In 2020, Korean government established the mid- to long-term goal of 24.4% emission reductions by 2030 compared to level of 2017, which is submitted to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).In order to present more challenging GHG reduction goals, LG Co., Ltd. set a base year as 2019 and set a mid-term goal to reduce 24.4% of GHG by 2030. Based on this target we will present LG Group's corporate goals from 2021 and with these global trends and industrial changes, the company is going to extend green business that can enhance the company's economic value for the present and the future generation."
"The International Panel of Climate Change (IPCC) published in its 5th Evaluation Report. According to the report, to keep the global average temperature rise below 2°C, the global GHG emissions should be reduced by 40% to 70% as of 2010 by 2050. LG Co., Ltd. has established a long-term goal that will reduce by 70% compared to 2019 In line with the direction of this mid-term goals. In order to achieve this target, it is essential to expand the use of renewable energy along with existing GHG reduction activities, and LG's subsidiaries are developing mid- to long-term plans to achieve 100% of renewable energy by 2050, including Green pricing, Renewable Energy Certificates (REC) Power Purchase Agreement (PPA)."
"-This is the mid-term absolute reduction target of LG Chem's company-wide emissions(total domestic and overseas emissions).LG Chem declared '2050 carbon-neutral growth' for the first time in the domestic chemical industry to participate in responding to the global climate change crisis. 2030 is one of the mid-points in achieving long-term goals, and by 2030, LG Chem will put a lot of effort into reducing greenhouse gas emissions, centering on the transition to renewable energy.  Renewable energy conversion plans by 2030 are also in place, and some business sites have already completed contracts to convert 100% to renewable energy. In addition, we will invest and support the development of innovative carbon reduction technology that is essential for us. In addition to investing in innovative technologies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, we plan to make bold investments for low-carbon energy conversion. A detailed review of the low-carbon fuel conversion of our cogeneration facility is underway."
"-This is the long-term absolute reduction target of LG Chem's company-wide emissions(total domestic and overseas emissions).LG Chem has committed to ‘2050 Carbon Neutral Growth' as the first chemical company in Korea. Carbon-neutral growth means decoupling carbon emissions from growth and maintaining emissions levels to its baseline year of 2019, which is a very challenging goal. As LG Chem's GHG emissions have increased by an average of 400,000 tons every year since 2015, this trend is expected to continue with continuous business growth and expansion such as theconstruction of the new NCC factory as well as  manufacturing facilities in Korea and overseas. To achieve the 2050 carbon-neutral growth target, 30 million tons of reduction is required compared to the business as usual forecast, and 60% of this target will be achieved through conversion to renewable energy. To this end, LG Chem has plans to convert the use of renewable energy to 100% of all business sites by 2050, and some facilities outside of Korea are already operating with 100% renewable energy."

"LG Electronics commits to set science-based emissions reduction targets across all scopes, in line with 1.5°C emissions scenarios and the criteria and recommendations of the Science Based Targets initiative.1. Scope includes domestic business site Scope 1 + 2, overseas production work sites and offices scope 1 + 2, including Scope 3.2. AB2 : To reduce greenhouse gas, LG Electronics set the year 2017 as the base year, and set a long-term goal of reducing absolute emissions by 50% by 2035. This is same amount of emission goal that we set as 2030 mid-term goal. We evaluate that 50 percent reduction compared to base year is the best available goal for now on. After we achieve mid-term goal, we will maintain the annual amount of GHG emissions.3. Achievement rate %= 639,010 tons (2017 emissions - 2020 emissions) / 966,570 tons (2035 target reductions)"
"Among Socep2 emissions, the target range was calculated and entered based only on the amount of electricity used.LG Energy Solutions joined the RE100 initiative in April 2021 and announced a plan to convert 100% of its electricity consumption to renewable energy by 2030.As part of LG Energy Solution's efforts to expand renewable energy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, plants in Poland and the US completed 100% renewable energy conversion in 2020 through Green pricing and REC.In addition, our Korean and Chinese plants are participating in national policies to gradually increase the amount of renewable energy used, and we plan to accomplish RE100 by 2030."

"Liberty Two Degrees (Liberty's property company) is Liberty's biggest contributor to our carbon footprint (approximately 83% of the group total in 2018) Liberty Two Degrees owns and manages office buildings and shopping centers such as Sandton, Eastgate etc.  During 2018 Liberty Two Degrees has as part of our wider group sustainability strategy set net-zero carbon, energy, waste and water targets by 2030.  According to the current carbon management strategy employed by Liberty Two Degrees the aim is to reduce its carbon emissions to this target by making use of the minimum amount of carbon offsetting as far as possible. (Not more that 10% of their total carbon footprint). According to this aspiration and the percentage of Liberty Two Degrees carbon footprint of the whole Liberty Group carbon footprint the target percentage reduction is therefore estimated at a 73% reduction of the total Liberty Group carbon footprint. Liberty Group is in the process of also setting net-zero carbon, energy, water and waste targets. We plan on adopting the net-zero science based-targets before the end of 2022."

"This is our minimum scope 1 and 2 reduction we hope to achieve as part of our goal to have net zero operations by 2030. Whilst this has not been certified by the science-based targets initiative, this reduction is greater than the required reduction in carbon emissions set out by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in order to keep global warming below 1.5 degrees. We hope to achieve the majority of the reduction through eliminating gas consumption in buildings. In 2030 we will purchase carbon credits to offset the remainder of our direct emissions. We intend to use certified offsets from high quality carbon removal projects."
"In 2020, we set an ambition to work with customers, Government and the market to help reduce the emissions we finance by more than 50% by 2030.

"Between 2013 and 2020, the Group achieved over 70% reduction in GHG emissions (Abs1). We achieved this through investment in energy efficiency measures: new technology, office and data centre consolidation and purchasing of 100% renewable electricity. During 2020, our environmental ambitions for the next ten years were raised as we embark on what the United Nations have coined the ‘Decisive Decade'.This new target supports us on our trajectory towards net-zero emissions by 2050. At the start of 2021, we stated our commitment to ‘Business Ambition for 1.5ºC', and therefore joined the ‘Race to Zero' campaign convened by the UN to build momentum around the shift to a decarbonised economy, ahead of COP26. As LSEG integrates with the Refinitiv business, who themselves have set science-based targets approved by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), the targets for both legacy businesses will be combined to provide a new Group-wide set of targets which will be shared in next year's CDP submission."

We are in the process of submitting this target for approval as a science-based target by SBTi.
"Even though SBTi is not applied to setting the group's emission target, Lotte Chemical voluntarily established a carbon neutrality plan with an annual emission reduction target of 3.1 % until 2050 which is more stringent than the target of 2.5 % recommended by SBTi (based on the well-below 2°C alignment). The mid-term target in 2030 is closely linked with the long-term target in 2050."

"This  target was originally set for 2030, but we decided we needed to be more aggressive based on our TCFD assessment in 2020  . This target encompasses all Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions produced by Lowe's and our subsidiaries. The most significant driver in emissions reduction to-date for the company has been the rollout of LED lighting across our store facilities.  We have also benefited from investments in high-efficiency HVAC units and building management systems.  Additionally, our first VPPA became operational in 2020, further offsetting our carbon emissions."
"Scope:This target encompasses all Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions produced by Lowe's and our subsidiaries.Reason for revision:Lowe's original target for 2030 was a 40% absolute reduction from our 2016 baseline emissions. We have revised this and have created a more aggressive target to further Lowe's commitment to fighting climate change and reducing our carbon emissions.Alignment with 1.5°C:• To align with 1.5 degrees, you need to have a 4.2% reduction rate per year for absolute reduction targets• We are committing to a 60% reduction (~4.3% YOY reduction), so we align with 1.5 degrees"
"The target is company-wide.  In 2019 financial year was specific, it covered  12 months form 2019 and also January from 2020.  In the future financial year will cover 1st Feb - 31st Jan and GHG emission will be calculated for the same time period ."
Emissions from SF6 gas used in the testing process of GIS Insulated Switchgear (GIS) products were emitted more than the standard year.
Greenhouse gas emissions from all of the company's vehicles and fuel burning
"Scope1 includes greenhouse gas emissions from all company vehicles and fuel combustion; Scope2 includes greenhouse gas emissions from self-use procurement of electricity; Scope3 includes raw materials procured for production, product use, outsourced activities, all contractors' vehicles, waste disposal, and greenhouse gas emissions from employee official travel."
This is a science-based target that covers the absolute reduction of GHG emissions in all lululemon owned and operated facilities.
"This is a Company-wide science-based target (SBT) and covers all Scope 1 & Scope 2 (market-based) emissions.  We have re-baselined the 2018 data, as we have reclassified some categories.  For example, we are now classifying emissions related to equipment at third-party co-location facilities as Scope 2 whereas in 2018 these had been classed as Scope 3 and were therefore excluded from the base year data at this time."
This target covers all upstream Scope 3 categories.  The base year emissions have undergone re-baselining and therefore differ from those submitted in our 2019 CDP disclosure.
Target to reduce emissions from business air travel by 20% annually
"Our target cover 100% of our headquarter functions, all our 4 production sites, 3 research, development and administrative sites in USA and one administrative site in Poland. Our sales affiliates are not covered by the target. Our sales affiliates constitute app. 5% of our total GHG emissions.As this target ended in 2020, we have developed a new Science based target during 2020. The new Science Based Target have been approved by Science Based Targets initiative and was announced in February 2021."
"Apart from our 10-year Science Based Target we have this supporting annual target. A 4% annual reduction will secure the realization of our long-term target, and a 4% annual reduction complies with the required annual reduction in the Absolute contraction method (well below 2°C ambition). Therefore, we consider the target to be science based."
"On top of our 10 year target, we have prepared this long-term target covering our scope 1 and 2 emissions company wide. This target cover 100% of our headquarter functions, all our 4 production sites, 3 research, development and administrative sites in USA and one administrative site in Poland. Our sales affiliates are not covered by the target. Our sales affiliates constitute app. 5% of our total GHG emissions. In 2035 all our use of city gas, district heating and electricity will be based on renewable energy sources. Additionally, we continuously look for possibilities to increase our conversion from gas oil and methane gas to renewable energy sources. Today 93% of our oil consumption at our Danish chemical site is bio oil. A 70% reduction from 2016 - 2035 require a 3.7% annual reduction which more than fulfil the required annual reduction in the Absolute contraction method (well below 2°C ambition). Therefore, we consider the target to be science based."
"Lundin Energy has set an absolute target of 50% by 2025 from a 2020 base. This is a new target that we have set this year. It covers 100% of our net equity share  Scope 1 and 2 emissions. Note that total Scope 1 and 2 emissions disclosed later in this CDP response are provided on an operational (100%) basis, but we also report on a net equity basis, which this absolute target is based on. Our approach to reach this is through our Decarbonisation Strategy, which prioritizes absolute emission reductions through electrification and renewable energy investments.We believe that our target is a science-based target and will seek approval from SBTi once the methodology for oil and gas companies is published. At present, SBTi is not approving targets from O&G companies while the guidance for the sector is still being finalized."
"As part of LIFE 2020, the Group is aiming to cut Scope 1 and 2 -market-based- greenhouse gas emissions by 25%, in absolute values, between 2013 (baseline year) and 2020. The target is set for all the 75 Maison and 5 sectors (Fashion and Leather Goods, Wine & Spirits, Perfume & Cosmetic, Watches & Jewellery, Selective Retailing). The reduction is for all sites between 2013 and the reporting year, for sites included in the Group reporting scope in 2013.The performance of production, logistics and administrative sites is calculated by comparing data for each site between 2013 and the reporting year. Store CO2 performance is calculated by multiplying CO2 efficiency for the reporting year (in metric tons of CO2 equivalent per square meter) by the baseline floor area (total floor area of stores reported in 2013). Actions are being pursued on three fronts: improving monitoring and reporting processes; increasing the energy efficiency of operations, particularly at the Group's stores; and expanding the use of renewable energy."
"For the new LIFE 360 CO2 targets (between 2019 and 2030), scope 1 & 2 and scope 3 are science-based targets. It aims to reduce (and/or avoid) emissions scope 1&2 greenhouse gas emissions by 50% by 2026 (baseline 2019). Having adopted the validation protocol of the Science Based Targets initiative, LVMH is implementing a carbon-reduction pathway in line with the Paris Agreement and working toward the EU target of carbon neutrality by 2050. LVMH is currently committed to the Science-Based Targets Initiative and in the curse to made its emission reduction targets validated by the end of 2021."
"We have committed through the Fashion Industry Charter for Climate Action to achieve a 30 per cent aggregate GHG emission reductions in scope 1, 2 and 3 of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Standard by 2030, against a baseline of no earlier than 2015"
"In 2020 we set a company-wide target to achieve 100% renewable electricity consumption starting from 2021, from a base year (2020) of 0% renewable electricity consumption. By the reporting year (jan 2021), we had achieved 100% renewable electricity consumption, thus achieved 100% of our targeted increase in renewable electricity compared with the base year."
We are a small company and this is only our 3rd year
"This target currently covers the Scope 1,2 and 3 emissions we report on, on an annual basis and have direct operational control of. These are emissions from both our office estate and our business travel.Scope 3 supply chain emissions are covered by a separate engagement target. Homeworking will also be addressed in future works.COVID and the resultant lockdowns significantly impacted M&G's business travel emissions in the reporting year. So, although the calculation states M&G has achieved the target, this is not the case once business-as-usual resumes and business travel emissions increase again.  Having said this, M&G will endeavour to keep these emissions as low as practically possible to ensure it meets it's 2030 reduction  target."
"M&M Cartage aimed to reduce our overall Scope 1 emissions by continuing to replace Class 8B diesel tractors with CNG tractors, this will allow for a reduction in scope 1 emissions per vehicle. As we are a company that continues to grow, it will take more time to reduce overall emissions due to the adding of tractors. We hope that we can reduce overall scope 1  emissions on our scale by 2030."
The target was  achieved and exceeded
"Absolute emissions target set within our net zero carbon strategy (Steps Without Footprints).  Covers the following scope 3 upstream emissions categories: business travel, waste generation, embodied carbon.  This covers 98.3% of our emissions in the base year as a percentage of total base year emissions, as T&D Losses CO2 are not included within our Steps Without Footprint net zero carbon scope.We increased the scope of Scope 3 reporting in 2020 to include working from home, reflecting the shift in working patterns, due to Covid-19."
"This target incorporates our global business travel. We have re-baselined to 2019 data in line with our 'Steps Without Footprints' Net Zero Carbon strategy.For 2020, there has been a considerable reduction in business travel carbon compared to 2019 largely due to Covid-19 and a reduction in travelling for work.  We have, however, also implemented a number of new initiatives to drive savings around construction site activities and use of technologies, which will remain in place beyond 2020.This falls within our wider 'Abs 1' target but has been pulled out as a separate target to focus our initiatives around business travel."
"In 2020, Macerich signed the commitment letter to set Science-based Targets. Macerich commits to reduce absolute Scopes 1, 2, and 3 emissions 46.2% by 2030 from a 2019 base year. Macerich utilized the Absolute Emissions Contraction method (version April 2020) to set these targets. These targets have been approved by the Science-based targets initiative."

"Macerich has committed to new SBT-approved absolute emissions reduction targets that will cover Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions. Thus these have been retired. The relevant sources of Scope 3 emissions covered in the target are waste generated in operations, business travel, employee commuting, and downstream leased assets. The aggressive target is supported by most of the objectives outlined in the attached matrix which is the core of our current Sustainability Strategic Plan. It will take a combination of the strategies, including on-site renewables, off-site renewable procurement, energy efficiency, and carbon off-set, in order to achieve carbon neutrality. We have laid out objectives in all of these areas that have the goal of and will result in a 2.5% - 5.0% carbon footprint reduction every year for the next 16 years. Macerich's total 2019 emissions (Scope 1, 2, and 3) achieved a 24.5% reduction from the baseline (2015) level, which is approximately 33% of the total 75% reduction target."

"This emission reduction target involves mobile combustion emissions related to our industrial vehicles, whose supply and management policies are under our control. In 2019, we started the movement of replacing many industrial vehicles fueled by LPG combustion, with electric industrial vehicles, starting with the older equipment that was most used in the operation. This replacement resulted in a 58% reduction in the indicator, making our operations safer, efficient and sustainable."
"This emission reduction target involves mobile combustion emissions, whose supply and management policies are under our control. Magalu regulated in its travel policy that corporate cars must be fueled with ethanol, aiming to neutralize the emissions of our fleet. In the base year, this indicator represented 16% of Scope 1 emissions, with the update in the policy we intend to reduce emissions from this source by 90%. The regulation extends to the use of ethanol for trips made in private and rental cars. In addition, the company plans to replace gasoline-fuel cars with flex-fuel or electric cars in 2021. Preventive and scheduled maintenance activities intend to contributed to fuel savings as well."
"This reduction target involves the purchase of electricity, market-based report. Magalu started to invest in renewable energy as the first strategy for reducing emissions, a movement that began in 2009. In 2019, Magalu had the goal to reduce in at least 40% in scope 2 emissions. The strategy consisted in installing photovoltaic panels and purchasing hydraulic energy from small hydroelectric plants to provide energy to more than 150 units of the company - stores, centers of distribution and our offices. The result is 44% of reduction in market-based emissions. We started with 1 distribution center fueled by renewable energy and ended 2020 with 26% of electricity consumption coming from renewable sources. Last year we also acquired Renewable Energy Certificate."
"For 6 years in row Magyar Telekom Group operates carbon neutral: electricity consumption of the Hungarian operations (Magyar Telekom Plc and T-Systems Hungary) was covered by 100% green energy, part of the electricity consumption of the North Macedonian operator was also covered by green energy, the rest of the CO2 emissions of the Group was offset. However this target was set only for the Magyar Telekom Plc."
"This target was set only for the Magyar Telekom Plc. Our target is to reduce our Scope3 emissions.  Focus areas : upstream transportation and distribution, employee commuting. Use of sold products cover the 2/3 of total Scope 3 emissions."
"SBT targets were set and approved for three businesses of the company namely MLDL, MWCDL (MWC Chennai), and MWCJL (MWC Jaipur) in 2019.  The Base Year for MLDL and MWCJL was considered as 2018, as the complete GHG inventory for all the three businesses was recalculated in 2018 (i.e., FY 19) as part of SBTi, whereas the Base Year for MWCDL was considered as 2016, since the most comprehensive GHG inventory data was available for the same.Reason for recalculation of GHG Inventory:Earlier, for Residential Business i.e.; MLDL, we used to consider the emissions from fuel consumption by our Project sites and Contractors under Scope 1; but with detailed inventorisation in FY 19 as part of SBTi, the emissions from fuel consumption by Contractors alone were categorized under Scope 3 as per the GHG protocol, and the emissions from fuel consumption by our Project sites alone were considered under Scope 1. Similarly, the emissions from Electricity consumption for our Project sites and Contractors were considered under Scope 2; but as part of SBTi, the emissions from Electricity consumption by Contractors and Project sites were separately considered under Scope 3, and Scope 2 respectively. The same process was followed for MWCJL.            Segregation of the Fuel and Electricity Consumption by Project sites and Contractors was not possible for 2016 (i.e., FY 17) due to unavailability of separate data for sites and contractors; hence the base year for MLDL and MWCJL was considered as 2018, as the complete GHG inventory was recalculated for FY 19 for the two business divisions - MLDL and MWCJL; whereas for MWCDL the Base Year was taken as 2016 as the complete inventory was available for the same. The target as mentioned in this section, is target set for MLDL.

"Maire Tecnimont has decided to consider undertaking further indebtedness of the type of ''ESG Linked Loan”, by entering into an instrument called Schuldschein loan demonstrating Group's effort in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals set by the United Nations and its aim at accelerating the world energy transition towards sustainable development and a circular economy approach.By linking its financing to business-relevant projects and the sustainability targets, the Group is going a step further in integrating its sustainability strategy into its business strategy.According to provisions of the Schuldschein loan, the interest rate payable on the principal amount outstanding thereof may be subjected to a future adjustment based on the Group's CO2 emissions evolution. In order to quantify the positive effects of its climate change mitigation investments, Maire Tecnimont Group has decided to measure the CO2 emission avoided (i.e., cumulated CO2 avoided emission calculated starting from the baseline-year until the year on which the target is set) and to compare them with the 2018 (''baseline”) total emissions of the Group. Maire Tecnimont has set the baseline reflecting the 2018 Total CO2 eq. emissions (please refer to Creating Value – 2018 Maire Tecnimont Report https://issuu.com/mairetecnimont/docs/creating_value___2018_sustainabilit?e=3301662/69440436). Moreover, for the only purpose of this instrument , Maire Tecnimont Group will account for the  Scope 3 emission relevant to Business Travel and Employee Commuting."
Abs1 target is the first part of the Group's Emissions Reduction Plan set in 2019 and validated by the SBTi. This first target covers all of the Group's Scope 1&2 emissions and aims at reducing them by 50% between 2018 and 2030. The targets covering greenhouse gas emissions of the scope 1+2 are consistent with the reductions required to keep warming to 1.5°C. Emissions are calculated using a market based methodology. The increase of emissions between 2019 and 2020 is mainly linked with the evolution of the scope (including new entity emissions of the Modani subsidiary).
"Abs2 target is the second part of the Group's emissions reduction plan set in 2019 and validated by the SBTi. This second target covers main Scope 3 categories, ie : purchased goods and services, upstream transportation and distribution, downstream distribution and transportation (incl. emissions from customers travelling to retail stores). The Group's objective is to reduce absolute emissions by 15% between 2018 and 2030. The targets covering greenhouse gas emissions of the scope 3 are consistent with the reductions required to keep warming to 1,5°C."

Long term target to reduce our usage and ultimately eliminate  our reliance on non-renewable natural gas for heating the properties under our control. This is through a plan of life cycle management plant upgrades. This target is to ensure we comply with the UK's Carbon Net Zero commitment. This scope 1 reduction target is in line with the target required to meet 2% above pre-industrial levels.
Reduce scope 1 natural gas and fuel emissions under our operational control by 30% by 2022. We aim to do this through implementing recommendations from a recent  energy savings audit and reducing our reliance on natural gas.  This scope 1 reduction target is more aggressive than the  target required to meet 1.5% above pre-industrial levels.
Reduce global energy usage by 10% per year from 2019 -2022 (30% in total). We aim to do this through implementing recommendations from a recent  energy savings audit.  This scope 2 Location-Based reduction target is more aggressive than the  target required to meet 1.5% above pre-industrial levels.
Increase our usage of renewable scope 2 -market based energy by 50% by 2022. We aim to do this by moving to 100% rego power suppliers in more global jurisdictions as this comes available.
Target coverage: Establishment of GHG reduction target based on Scope 1&2 emissions from all businesses sites directly owned and operated by Mando.Reduction rate: 3% annual reduction compared to base year (2015) emissions (3%/year reduction x 10 years = 30% reduction during 2015-2025 period)
"Target coverage: Establishment of GHG reduction target based on Scope 1&2 emissions from all business sites owned directly by MandoReduction rate: Compared to base year (2015), annual reduction of 3% between 2015 and 2025, and annual reduction of 0.8% between 2025 and 2040. In conclusion, the average annual reduction of about 1.4% over the 2015-2040."
"According to our ACT Low Carbon Strategy Plan analysis, here are our revised 2018/2025/2030 Climate targets:• Reduce Scope 1+2 CO2e absolute emissions by 30% by 2030, and by 13% by 2025 which means• Reduce Scope 1+2 CO2e emissions per metric ton of shipped products by 57% by 2030 and by 35% by 2025.This target has not been verified by the independent cabinet KPMG.In order to achieve those goals, we have defined a target of:• Increase renewable energy consumption proportion to 33% of total energy consumption by 2025 and by 50% by 2030.To reduce its dependence on fossil fuels and gradually reduce its direct emissions from scopes 1 and 2, MANE gives priority to actions to reduce its energy consumption.This approach is justified, since 94% of CO2 emissions from scopes 1 and 2 are due to energy consumption in its sites, with the rest due to leakage of refrigerant fluids. Another area of action is the search for alternatives to fossil fuels.Since 2009, we have managed to improve the energy efficiency of our industrial sites by 25% (from 11.0 to 8.2 GJ/t) and at the same time, we have increased the share of renewable energy by 28 points, allowing the Group to reduce its GHG emissions from scopes 1 and 2 by 16% between 2009 and 2021. So, we've met and exceeded our 2021 goal.It should be noted that more than half of the Group's emissions are attributable to MANE plants in Ohio State (32% of total emissions in absolute terms) and Indonesia (20%), while these sites alone account for only 26% of total tonnage shipped. In both countries, electricity emission factors are also much higher than in France (about 10 times more), with electricity production mainly from fossil fuels."
"According to our ACT Low Carbon Strategy Plan analysis and to SBTi scenarios, here are our revised 2018/2025/2030 Climate targets:• Stabilize Scope 3 CO2e absolute emissions by 2030.• Reduce Scope 3 CO2e emissions per metric ton of product by 38% by 2030.This target has not been verified by the independent cabinet KPMG.Since 2016, the MANE Group has conducted a global carbon footprint of its activities to identify significant greenhouse gas emissions across its entire value chain (direct and indirect).The results of this carbon footprint show the importance of raw materials in its carbon footprint.The Group is currently working on a plan of action to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions of scope 3, which is indirectly linked to the activity of its sites."

"We developed a GHG Protocol-compliant emissions inventory system currently used in our initiative to monitor and reduce our GHG Scope 1 and Scope 2 absolute emissions (both adopted in 2021 as key corporate metrics) as well as our emissions intensity.In 2020, our emissions targets only covered emissions from fuel consumption (for Scope 1) as well as electricity consumption and system loss (for Scope 2).Meanwhile, our 2021 targets include all Scope 1 and Scope 2 emission sources across our value chain (with particular inclusion of all our power plants under MGen). Our new set of targets are formed under our Long-Term Sustainability Strategy (LTSS). Our LTSS emissions targets have been set by projecting our baseline emissions through 2030 (using 2019 as base year). We then identified various emissions abatement levers to set absolute reduction targets by 2030 and divided this through yearly targets up to 2030.The targets we have set under LTSS are not science-based targets since SBTi requires inclusion of scope 3 emissions (representing majority of our emissions), which are emissions that are beyond Meralco's control as a regulated distribution utility. Meralco operates within the Philippine government's least-cost, technology-neutral framework and mandate where Distribution Utilities must undergo a Competitive Selection Process (CSP) in the procurement of power supply."
"The Group developed a GHG Protocol-compliant emissions inventory system currently used to monitor and reduce its GHG Scope 1 and Scope 2 absolute emissions (reported in 2020 as part of the Company's key corporate metrics).Meralco's 2020 Scope 1 target includes emissions from our company-owned Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) vehicles. On the other hand, Meralco's 2020 Scope 2 target includes emissions from system loss volumes and from the Company's own electricity consumption."

"Maple Leaf Foods engaged in a robust process with an external organization to develop our comprehensive carbon inventory. We developed SBTs to provide us with a clearly defined pathway to future-proof growth by specifying how much and how quickly we need to reduce GHG emissions to meet the requirements of the global Paris Climate Accord. On September 9, 2019, the SBTi approved our science-based targets for GHG emissions reduction. As part of this approval, the SBTi verified Maple Leaf Foods' comprehensive carbon inventory that was developed in accordance with the internationally accepted Greenhouse Gas Protocol - developed by the World Resources Institute and World Business Council for Sustainable Development. We are reporting our progress against our absolute targets which have a 2018 baseline."
"The Carbon Footprint (CFP), expressed as tCO2eq, takes into account the overall emissions of all the phases ofthe life cycle of the product/service, ''from cradle to grave” compared with the Global Warming Potential of CO2.It is calculated from the provisioning phases and treatment of raw materials used, to then take into account thephases related to processing and production of the product, through to transport to the customer and even useand disposal activities.The company carries out this survey to:• identify important aspects in terms of the effects on the climatic change of the factories belonging to the companyin order to reduce and/or mitigate them;• monitor impact variations from a climatic point of view.The survey considers all the direct emissions (Scope 1) and indirect emissions (Scope 2) of climate-changinggas associated with the factories assessed.Thanks to this survey, Marchesini Group has contributed also to experimenting the calculation of the carbonfootprint within the LIFE Clim'Foot project (Climate Governance: implementing public policies to calculate and reduceorganizations' carbon Footprint, LIFE Clim'Foot - Climate Governance: Implementing public policies to calculate and reduce organisations' carbon footprint LIFE14GIC/FR/000475, http://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/project/Projects/index.cfm?fuseaction=search.dspPage&n_proj_id=5259.), aimed at providing a cognitive and operative contribution to support policies and actions to reduce greenhouse gases."

"Even before the formal approval of our Science Based Targets, Mastercard implemented a cohesive strategy to achieve our 2025 emission reduction goals.  In April 2020, we updated our Scope 1 & 2 Science Based Target to align with the 1.5°C scenario. Additionally, we committed to RE100. In Spring of 2021, we committed to be net zero by the year 2050. We are implementing a number of tactics to achieve this goal. For example, we are currently exploring monitoring-based commissioning and advanced energy analytics, low-carbon technology, and onsite renewable generation projects at our larger campuses. Please note that the base year was updated in accordance with Mastercard's Inventory Management Plan."
"In preparation for our commitment to Science Based Targets, Mastercard implemented a cohesive strategy to achieve our 2025 emission reduction goals.  Starting by identifying our top emitters by spend, we are now working directly with these suppliers to calculate actual emissions resulting from our purchase of goods and services.  Mastercard's supply chain emissions comprise well over 75% of our total GHG inventory making this 20% target our most ambitious. In pursuit of this target, we increased our CDP Supply Chain requested participation from 12 suppliers (approximately 30% of spend) in 2016 to a supplier base that constituted 60% of our global spend in 2017.  Our goal for 2019 was 75% of global spend invited to respond to the CDP, where we achieved 85%, and refined to 83% for 2020. Our in-house supply chain specialist is working hand-in-hand with first time CDP reporters to help guide them through the process and create more accurate emission calculation methodologies. Please note that the base year was updated in accordance with Mastercard's Inventory Management Plan."

"The Company partners with Franchisees to reduce greenhouse gas emissions related to McDonald's restaurants and offices by 36% by 2030 from a 2015 base year.The target includes all Company-wide Scope 1 & 2 emissions, as well as operational waste (upstream Scope 3) and waste associated with final food and packaging delivered to customers post-sale on restaurant premise (downstream Scope 3) for all restaurants (Company-owned and Franchised), and Scope 1 & 2 emissions for Franchisee restaurants (downstream Scope 3).These figures reflect the latest enhancements to our 2015 base year emissions which have been updated based on best practice guidance on leveraging the latest methodology and data available. We continue to be on track to meet the restaurant and offices portion of our Science-Based Target. Absolute emissions related to restaurants and offices have reduced from our 2015 base year. GHG reductions in the reporting year of 2020 are driven by McDonald's continued investment in renewable energy, efforts on building/equipment energy efficiency and recycling initiatives, as well as the impact of  COVID19 related temporary restaurant closures/reduced operations. Once online, the US VPPA transactions referenced in section C4.3 a and b are expected to contribute a 20% reduction from the 2015 baseline (or 55% of the restaurants and offices portion of our global Science-Based Target).As we continue to enhance our methodology and data quality in future years, we can expect the baseline and annual progress figures to further adjust in future reporting cycles."

Finally for the steel, improve the metal plate cut-out.)All those action are a part of an approach deployed on all our sites, this eco-design approach allows us to review all our production systems and aims to reduce the overall impact of our products. This is achieved by reducing the size of our products and the use of responsible materials. All this while taking into account the end of life of our products after use.80% of our sites are now are now in this process, the COVID 19 epidemy prevents us from being able to properly assess the impact of the actions implemented in previous years. But our objectives are clear, by 2030 we want 100% of the products made on our sites to have been optimised in terms of the materials used and their end-of-life. To achieve this, we will be implementing an LCA (Life Cycle Assessment) tool in 2021, which will systematically help us to make the right decisions. Product and services (scope 3) represent 5638 TCO2, use and end of the products sold (scope 3) represent 682 TCO2 this is why those targets are so important.We do not lose sight of the other objectives related to scope 3, such as freight and staff travel, which account for 1347 TEQCO2"

"Target is carbon neutral.Medibank set an absolute target to be certified carbon neutral for FY20. This target applied to Medibank's Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions (upstream and downstream). Medibank's carbon neutral target is an ongoing absolute commitment year on year.2018 was the first year of Medibank achieving carbon neutrality but the target is set and approved each year. Medibank aims to avoid and reduce emissions and offsets any remaining emissions across Scope 1, 2 and 3 (upstream and downstream). In FY20 Medibank's carbon emissions reduced by 5.7% from the previous year (vs FY19) with a 9.1% reduction in Scope 3 emissions largely driven by reduced business travel, IT equipment and employee commuting. This follows a 24.7% emissions reduction in the previous period.Medibank is verified carbon neutral under the Australian Government's Climate Active program. Medibank achieved carbon neutrality primarily by purchasing carbon offsets for Scope 1, 2 and 3.Medibank is now developing a long-term emissions reduction target and pathway and work is currently underway to develop a robust science-based plan and targets."
"Numerous targets have been set in Mediclinic South Africa (MCSA) and Mediclinic Middle East (MCME) on activities that translate into carbon emissions, with a particular focus on electricity and greenhouse gas emitting activities with high global warming potential. These targets are yearly, inclusive of 2020 as the baseline year and 2021 as the target year. When totalled, the combined targets equate to a carbon reduction of 4,342 tonnes CO2e. The targets for MCSA include: 2% reduction on electricity consumption; stabilise healthcare waste (HCRW) to landfill to 2019 levels; 10% reduction in general waste to landfill. The targets for MCME include: 1% reduction in electricity consumption; 1% reduction in N2O; 1% reduction in anaesthetic gases; 1% reduction in air-conditioning and refrigerant gas refills; 1% reduction in HCRW); 2% reduction in general waste to landfill."

To enter SBTi targets, a global perimeter has been considered of the hotels that are owned, rented and managed by the company (94% of hotels that represent at least 95% of emissions).  In 2020 we measure emissions of our perimeter in 100% compared to 76% in 2019. In 2020 we continued to make progress in the implementation of our environmental management system to guarantee the measurement of consumption in hotels that up until now had not been able to report data, recalculating our base year and the following to directly compared with our current reporting year emissions, ensuring ''like with like” comparisons over time. New hotel openings have also been added to the perimeter of energy measurement, estimating the data according to the climatic characteristics of the area and/or the number of hotel rooms. The measurement perimeter is thus increased by 67 hotels in total energy and emission measurements. Following, the main figures for reporting year:- Total aggregate scope: 272 hotels with operational control, of which 67 new ones compared to 2019:- 51 hotels, with real consumption data (76% of the new ones); - 16, emissions were estimated (24% of the new ones). These represents 6% of total gross emissions Scope 1+2.In addtion, recently, we have expressed our commitment to the Business Ambition For 1.5 ° C initiative, being part of the companies that are leading the transition to zero carbon emissions by setting emission reduction targets through the Science Based Targets Initiative. Our new SBTi Targets was also submitted to the SBTi for an official evaluation during this year."

"During 2018 Melia Hotels International has defined several targets aline with Science- Based Target iniciative which are being implementing in 2019.In 2020 we measure emissions of our Aggregated perimeter in 100% compared to 76% in 2019, recalculating our base year and the following to directly compared with our current reporting year emissions, ensuring ''like with like” comparisons over time.Summary, emissions have changed compared to the previous year due to various emission reduction activities and changes in boundary. But it was also a significant reduction of emissions due to a decrease in our commercial activity due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2020 just as we started the new year, COVID-19 global pandemic was declared by WHO, with a particularly dramatic impact on the travel industry.

"Recently, we have expressed our commitment to the Business Ambition For 1.5 ° C initiative, updating our current SBTi (WB2C) with more ambitiuos targets to pursue efforts to limit warming to under 1.5°C. These new SBTi Targets are in validation process.Our target is company-wide and a global perimeter with operational control (owned, rented and managed hotels).During 2020 we did a effort to integrated in our EMS whole operational perimeter (272 hotels, 100% of global perimeter that represent at least 95% of emissions).  In addition, when hotels are not integrated EMS, for example new openings, if a full year is not available, consumption data is estimated according to the characteristics of the hotel and where it is located, as established by the GHG Protocol and SBT guidance.The target-setting method used is based in absolute emissions contraction with a linear annual reduction of 4.2% to help limit warming to 1.5 ° C.

"In 2019, GKN Aerospace set  a short to medium term target to achieve a 5% annual (Scope 1 & 2) GHG Emission reduction target across all sites. For reducing energy and emissions, plans are to follow a method of SCRPT (switch, cut, recover, produce and trade) for energy and 3C (cut, change or capture) for emissions,  investigating opportunities for sites to switch to energy contracts with more renewable content, modifications to processes to reduce energy consumption and exploring opportunities for onsite clean energy generation. As a first result of this approach, GKN Aerospace will move to a 100% renewable electricity contract for all Dutch GKN Aerospace sites 2021, with an estimated saving of 12,200 metric tons of CO2 annually."
"GKN Automotive has set short term annual targets of reducing energy usage by 3%, this is being tracked through its E-CIMS (Environmental Continuous Improvement Management System).

Mercialys commits to reduce absolute scope 3 GHG emissions from business travel by 26% by 2030 from a 2017 base-year.These emissions are part of the Scope 3 category / business travel as disclosed in question 6.5.Mercialys had already started to decrease the GHG emissions linked to the business trips in 2019. And the decline in emissions has also been largely impacted by the Covid-19 crisis in 2020.
"Our goal is a 40% absolute reduction in GHG emissions from 2015 to 2025. We used the ""Sectoral Decarbonization Approach"" to calculate and set this goal as allowed by the SBTi.  The base year emissions have been adjusted in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (Revised Edition) to include changes in our operating boundary and any new information that allows us to quantify emissions more accurately.  The most significant contributors to decreasing our GHG emissions were demand reduction and conservation, energy-efficiency projects, consolidation of our office, lab and manufacturing spaces; and the shift of some of our power supply from purchased electricity to on-site-generated electricity through combined heat and power systems, as well as a large increase in utilization of renewable energy."
"In 2020, we integrated Versum Materials, which we acquired in October 2019, into our reporting. Because Versum Materials has no data that dates back to 2006, we could not reflect these additional emissions in our 2020 climate action target. However, we will be integrating these into the scope of our next target, which will take effect in 2021. We lowered the greenhouse gas emissions of our legacy business (excluding Versum) by roughly 25% from our 2006 baseline, thus achieving our overall reduction goal despite growth in our operating business. After reaching our 2020 20% reduction goal successfully, Merck set itself new climate goals in 2020. By 2030, we intend to lower our direct (Scope 1) and indirect (Scope 2) emissions by 50% (2020 baseline). This target covers the whole Merck Group (operational control as specified in this questionnaire). We are also aiming to cover 80% of our electricity purchase from renewable sources by 2030.By 2040, we intend to achieve climate neutral operations along our entire value chain. This target covers our Scope 1, 2 and 3 greenhouse gas emissions.End of 2021 the decision will be taken whether we commit to a science-based target."

"At the time we set this target, we did not know our Scope 3 emissions.  Since then we have collaborated with the Center for Industrial Research and Service (CIRAS) at Iowa State University to identify and quantify our Scope 3 (value chain) greenhouse gas emissions for fiscal years 2019, 2020, and 2021, CIRAS, which is associated with the university's College of Engineering, works with companies to fashion solutions specific to their individual needs. Now that we have these emissions, we will conduct detailed analysis and explore the possibility of adjusting our Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas reduction goal to a comprehensive goal across all scope, possibly reported to Science-Based Targets."
"We have investigated the use of applying a Science Based Targets in our approach towards reducing our emissions profile. However, as a 100% renewable energy generator with no direct emissions from generating electricity, we found that we are already below the proposed emissions intensity target for the electricity sector (0.03 tCO2e/MWh by 2050, whereas we already have zero Scope 1 emissions from generating electricity), and therefore this methodology is not relevant to our operations. We have decided to set a target of reducing our operational emissions in half by 2030 (excluding emissions related to constructing new renewable energy power stations, but including our supply chain and operational footprint), and we consider this to be a science based target.Our operational emissions target includes scope 1, 2 and 3 (excludes one-off construction and scope 3 energy purchased and on-sold). As our scope 3 emissions make up 97% of our total carbon footprint, this inherently requires substantive abatement in our supply chain."
"In September 2020, MetLife established 11 new Environmental Goals, including a 30% location-based GHG reduction target by 2030 (2019 baseline year). This reduction target is part of a broader carbon neutrality commitment (first announced in 2015 and re-committed in 2020) to achieve and maintain carbon neutrality for all Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions and from Scope 3 business travel annually. This reduction target applies to MetLife's global owned and leased offices,  fleet, and business travel. In 2019, we nearly tripled our previous 2020-focused public goals to reduce energy and emissions globally by 10% by 2020, reducing emissions by 27% globally. In conjunction with this goal, MetLife set 10 other 2030 environmental goals, including a  goal to achieve green or healthy building certification for 40% of our global office portfolio (s.q. ft.) and mobilize 100 suppliers to set a GHG emission reductions target by 2025. In 2020 alone, we reduced energy consumption by 18% thanks to efficiencies achieved while shifting the majority of our workforce to work-from-home during the pandemic. As a financial services company, the methodology for setting science-based targets is still evolving. The 30% GHG emissions reduction goal outlined in this question does align with the majority of science-based target requirements, and was calculated in alignment with a 1.5°C scenario.  Our commitment to carbon neutrality aligns with forward-looking scenarios to limit average global temperature increases to 1.5°C and demonstrates MetLife's immediate and long-term concern for providing a healthy environment for our customers. Our additional goals, including our supply chain engagement goal which requires 100 suppliers to set GHG targets by 2025, further show our commitment to making actual reductions in the short-term. MetLife looks forward to seeing how the Science-Based Target initiative for financial service companies will evolve in coming years, so that we can set science-based targets in alignment with approved methodology. Emissions reductions reflected to date have been achieved through various emissions reduction strategies, including energy efficiency capital projects, integration of sustainability practices into new workspaces, office space consolidation in metropolitan markets, and increased use of collaboration tools to offset employee travel."
"In late 2015, MetLife set a goal to achieve and maintain carbon neutrality for all Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions from MetLife's owned and leased office facilities around the world, its fleet vehicles, and Scope 3 business travel by the end of 2016.  MetLife first achieved its carbon neutrality goal in December of 2016, achieved again in 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020 and intends to maintain this status moving forward. For the purpose of this report, we are reporting carbon neutrality as a year over year 100% reduction in Scope 1 +2 market-based emissions and Scope 3 business travel. The base year emissions are MetLife's 2020 location-based emission figures, which as a result of purchasing renewable energy credits and third-party certified carbon credits in MetLife's markets of operation become neutralized. As a financial services company, the methodology for setting SBTs is still evolving. A commitment to carbon neutrality aligns with forward-looking scenarios to limit average global temperature increases to 2°C and demonstrates MetLife's immediate and long-term concern for providing a healthy environment for our customers. Our additional ten environmental goals, including our30% location-based GHG reduction target, goal to achieve green or healthy building certification for 40% of our global office portfolio (s.q. ft.) and goal to mobilize 100 suppliers to set a GHG emission reductions target by 2025 further show our commitment to making actual reductions in the short-term and are aligned with climate science. MetLife looks forward to seeing how the SBT initiative will evolve in coming years, so that we can set science-based targets in alignment with approved methodology. Emissions reductions reflected to date have been achieved through various emissions reduction strategies, including energy efficiency capital projects, integration of sustainability best practices into new workspaces, office space consolidation in metropolitan markets to reduce bottom line expenses and maximize operational and environmental performance, and increased use of collaboration tools, such as telepresence, videoconferencing, web-ex, and more, to offset employee travel. MetLife continues to evaluate the progress of our 2030 target by collaborating with business partners to collect and aggregate data."

"(Meralco)In support of SDG 13: Climate Action, One Meralco established GHG emissions as a top performance indicator at the corporate and business unit levels in 2020. Sustainability metrics, including emissions, accounted for 25 percent of Meralco's and the CEO's performance assessment. Clear, quantifiable targets and stretch levels were set for these metrics, which were regularly monitored and managed by the Group's Senior Leadership Team. Beginning in the first half of 2021, these metrics will also be overseen by the recently established Sustainability Committee of Meralco's Board of Directors.Target coverage is viewed at our operating company level."

"Metsä Board's company-wide target is that fossil CO2 emissions (scopes 1+2) will be zero by the end of 2030 compared to the base year 2016. This target has been approved by the Science Based Targets initiative and the target meets the requirements of the most ambitious objective of the Paris Agreement, which is to limit global warming increase to 1.5 degrees. To achieve -100% absolute scope 1+2 emission reductions Metsä Board has a roadmap to 2030 including investments and adjustments that will be made at every mill. These actions will enable the switch from fossil fuels to bio-based fuels, electrifying some of the processes which currently use fossil-based natural gas, and improvement of energy-efficiency of the mills. The biggest investments will be made at Husum mill, including renewal of recovery boiler and turbine of the pulp mill as well as renewal of the fibre line. In addition to own energy production at MB's mills, all purchased energy will be based on fossil free energy sources by the end of 2030. This requires reconsideration of the current energy purchasing contracts. Target for MB's energy efficiency improvement is >10% between 2018-2030, which helps in reducing GHG emissions. Furthermore, MB's target to reduce process water use by 30% per product tonne in 2018-2030 supports the GHG reduction targets, because thanks to reduction in the water use, less energy is needed  for pumping and heating of the process water, and less energy is needed in the waste water treatment plant (because the water volume will be smaller). All this helps to cut CO2 emissions."
"Metsä Board's company-wide target Abs3 is aligned with the parent company Metsä Group's climate targets, in which the target period is 2018-2030.  For Metsä Board, the content of the target Abs3 equals the target Abs2 (approved by the SBTi) in all other terms, but in Abs3 the base year is 2018 instead of 2016.   Metsä Board's target is that fossil CO2 emissions (scopes 1+2) will be zero by the end of 2030 compared to the base year 2018. To achieve -100% absolute scope 1+2 emission reductions Metsä Board has a roadmap to 2030 including investments and adjustments that will be made at every mill.

All this helps to cut CO2 emissions.Metsä Board has also joined the Finnish energy efficiency agreement in 2017. In the energy efficiency agreement Metsä Board has committed to improve its energy efficiency by 7% from year 2017 to 2025. The target has been allocated to Metsä Board's Finnish production units and the total cumulative energy saving target is 273,463 MWh/year. The performance was 209,241 MWh in 2017-2020."
Our absolute emission targets are approved by Science-Based Target Initiative and are aligned with scenario limiting global temperature increase to 1.5 degrees. Target covers Metso Outotec's scope 1 and 2 emissions.
"Target is to decrease CO2 emissions from logistics by 20% by 2025 compared to 2019. Our absolute emission targets are approved by Science-Based Target Initiative and are aligned with scenario limiting global temperature increase to 1.5 degrees. Target covers upstream and downstream logistics.Optimizing material routes from warehouses to customers brings not only cost and time savings but also emissions reductions. The material delivery routes will shorten, and we are able to follow the saved CO2 emissions precisely per saved kilometer. Metso Outotec partners with the largest global transport companies who follow and report on their CO2 emissions."
"Our absolute emission targets are approved by Science-Based Target Initiative and are aligned with scenario limiting global temperature increase to 1.5 degrees.  Product use target is that 20% of emissions reduced from the use of sold products by 2025. The 2019 baseline figure includes 4 products and 2020 includes emissions avoided from 13 products.Minerals processing is a very energy-intensive process. Innovating more energy efficient solutions is one of the key drivers in the mining industry. We have set a science-based target for our energy efficient grinding technologies: crushing equipment (Pebble crushing, Ore sorters, Conveyor solutions), grinding equipment (HRC, Vertimill® , SMD, HIGmill,  AG mills, Pebble mills), separation equipment (FloatForce, SkimAir, Dry Cobblers) and Ceramic filters (products included in 2020). We aim at reducing 20% of emissions by using the technologies in Metso Outotec products in the most energy-intensive customer processes by 2025."
"Target: 100 % renewable electricity by 2020. 99% of our base year Scope 2 emissions (2018) are from  purchased electricity. Our target to source 100 % renewable electricity is part of our wider carbon neutrality target. The target achievement is 99,3 % which we consider equal to 100 %. In 2020 METTLER TOLEDO conducted a climate-related scenario assessment together with a sustainability consultancy partner assessing the opportunity to target  carbon neutrality and how a more ambitious decarbonization pathway aligned with Science Based Targets (SBT) could look like for us. To assess potential targets we applied the ""Absolute Contraction Method"" and evaluated scenarios aligned with 2DS, IEA WB2DS and a 1,5 Degree scenario developed by the International Energy Agency (IEA) and compared it with business a as usual (BAU) scenario. Using 2018 as the baseline year the results concluded that our current emission reduction performance for Scope 1 and 2 is in line with a 1,5 degree trajectory. 2020 performance: 57 % reduction in Scope 1 & 2 emissions in compared to 2018, mainly due 100 % sourcing of renewable electricity for our global operations achieved in 2020. We have not yet committed to SBT but are using the scenario analysis to inform and guide our strategy."
"MGM Resorts International began the process of investigating and setting a Science-based absolute target in 2018.  MGM engaged with World Resources Institute (WRI) and set an absolute target intended to comply with the ""well below two degrees Celsius scenario"" using a baseline year of 2019 and a target year of 2034.  Following further review and guidance from ADEC Innovations in 2020/2021, MGM revised this absolute target to instead comply with the most ambitious ""1.5 degrees Celsius aligned scenario"".  The revised target is a reduction of absolute Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions of 50% by 2030, using a baseline year of 2019.  The 2019 baseline emissions inventory excludes one property that was divested at the end of that year.  This target is presently being reviewed for approval by the Science-Based Targets Initiative (SBTi).  We have followed the guidelines established by the SBTi.  However, at the time of CDP submission the target has not yet been formally approved by the SBTi."
"Michelin has prepared science-based targets on scopes 1, 2 and 3 and submitted them to SBTi in October 2019. The targets were validated in May 2020 (Michelin submitted for all 3 scopes since scope 3 emissions are greater than 40% of the total). On scopes 1 and 2, Michelin committed to reduce absolute scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 38% by 2030 from a 2010 base year (abs1). To date Michelin is on track to meet this scope 1 and 2 ambition by 2030. Beyond this, Michelin has set a new long-term ambition to reach Zero Net Emissions on scopes 1 and 2 by 2050 (Abs2). A new intermediary target, in line with the new 2050 target, was set in the second half of 2020 to guide this process, based on a linear reduction pathway (Abs3).Alignement with 2DS : This target is aligned with SBTi 2DS because it commits the Group to reach net zero no later than 2050 and comes with a mid term (2030) target involving a pace of progress better than 1.23 percent per year. Recaculation of base year emissions for SBT submission:As described in our 2015 registration document (p 178), the same emission factor was used until 2014 for all of the sites purchasing steam, regardless of the primary energy or technology used by the vendor. As of 2015, in order to more accurately depict foreseeable developments in energy sourcing, we decided to use three emissions factors, one for each primary energy used (coal, fuel oil and gas), including reasonable energy efficiency and loss assumptions. Now, in the framework of preparing our submission to Science Based Targets Initiative,  we recalculated our 2010 (base year) emissions with the new emission factors (EF) applied to steam purchases: with the new EFs, our 2010 emissions would have been 3 850 000 tonnes instead of 4 067 000. For simplicity reasons in our internal communication and target setting, until the end of 2020, our short term, non-submitted to SBTi 2020 target  was based on our historical 2010 emission value (4 067 000 tonnes). However, the recalculated 2010 base-year emissions (3,850,000 tonnes) was the base for our SBTi submission (2030 and 2050 targets). We also incorporated the emissions of two, newly acquired sites."

On scopes 1 and 2, Michelin committed to reduce absolute scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 38% by 2030 from a 2010 base year (abs1). To date Michelin is on track to meet this scope 1 and 2 ambition by 2030. Beyond this, Michelin has set a new long-term ambition to reach Zero Net Emissions on scopes 1 and 2 by 2050 (Abs2). A new intermediary target, in line with the new 2050 target, was set in the second half of 2020 to guide this process, based on a linear reduction pathway (Abs3). Alignement with WB2D : This target is aligned with SBTi WB2D because it involves a pace of progress better than 2.5 percent per year. Besides, it comes with a net-zero target no later than 2050 (Abs 2) so it is also aligned with Race to Zero - Business Ambition for 1.5°C.Recaculation of base year emissions for SBT submission:As described in our 2015 registration document (p 178), the same emission factor was used until 2014 for all of the sites purchasing steam, regardless of the primary energy or technology used by the vendor. As of 2015, in order to more accurately depict foreseeable developments in energy sourcing, we decided to use three emissions factors, one for each primary energy used (coal, fuel oil and gas), including reasonable energy efficiency and loss assumptions. Now, in the framework of preparing our submission to Science Based Targets Initiative,  we recalculated our 2010 (base year) emissions with the new emission factors (EF) applied to steam purchases: with the new EFs, our 2010 emissions would have been 3 850 000 tonnes instead of 4 067 000. or simplicity reasons in our internal communication and target setting, until the end of 2020, our short term, non-submitted to SBTi 2020 target  was based on our historical 2010 emission value (4 067 000 tonnes).  However, the recalculated 2010 base-year emissions (3,850,000 tonnes) was the base for our SBTi submission (2030 and 2050 targets). We also incorporated the emissions of two, newly acquired sites."
"The result reported here is an approximation, given the high levels of uncertainty in Scope 3 accounting, which range from +/-10% to +/-30% depending on the Scope 3 category, The Scope 3 inventory undergoes continuous improvement in methodology and quality of data."
"We have seen a significant reduction in Scope 1 emissions.This is due to several factors including rebalancing and refocus of our internal fabs by movinghigh-runner materials to locations running larger wafers with advanced abatement technology andfocusing our older-technology fab into a boutique fab running lower-volume, specialty materials.We acknowledge the impact that COVID may have had on these numbers in 2020.  As the numbers shown represent raw data that has not been normalized, over the next year we will finalize and standardize our normalization methodology, which may significantly modify these numbers.  This data has not been reviewed, and a target has not been set."
"Abs8 is a Scope 3 tracking goal. In that context, 2013 is the baseline year; no reduction from baseline is relevant although we do calculate and disclose this metric: for CY2019 the CO2e decreased approximately 5.41% due primarily to a decrease in production output. Reduction from the baseline year will continue not to be relevant because this is a tracking goal."
"In 2017, Microsoft committed to reducing absolute Scope 1 + Scope 2 (market-based) emissions by 75 percent by 2030, against a 2013 baseline. In January 2020, as part of our carbon negative announcement, we announced a bolder goal of reducing our Scope 1 and 2 emissions to near zero by 2025, which we will achieve through the following steps: a) By 2025, we will procure enough renewable energy to cover 100 percent of our electricity usage, meaning that we will have power purchase agreements for green energy contracted for 100 percent of carbon-emitting electricity consumed by all our datacenters, buildings, and campuses. b) We will electrify our global campus operations vehicle fleet by 2030. c) We will pursue International Living Future Institute Zero Carbon certification and LEED Platinum certification for our Silicon Valley Campus and Puget Sound Campus Modernization projects. d) We will eliminate our dependency on diesel fuel at our datacenters by 2030. Abs1 supports our work to drive our Scope 1 + Scope 2 emissions to near zero and our carbon negative commitment (NZ1). It will help avoid more than 10 million metric tons of carbon emissions by 2030 and put Microsoft on a path, as a company, to meet the goals set in the Paris climate agreement."
"Abs2 is not a standalone target but rather the outcome of our carbon neutral (Abs4), carbon negative (NZ1), and renewable electricity commitments; it is an extension of Abs1."
"Microsoft announced in January 2020 that we will cut our Scope 1 + Scope 2 + Scope 3 emissions by more than half by 2030. We will achieve this goal, in part, by expanding our internal carbon fee to cover all Scope 3 categories, which will provide an incentive for our business groups to work with their supply chains to reduce the carbon intensity of the goods and services that they supply. This target supports our commitment by 2030 to be carbon negative (reported as target NZ1 in this response) and by 2050 to remove from the atmosphere an equivalent amount of all the carbon dioxide our company has emitted either directly or by our electricity consumption since we were founded in 1975."
"Starting in July 2012, Microsoft has had (and has achieved) a target to be carbon neutral every year from fiscal year (FY) 2013 onward. We achieved carbon neutrality in FY20 (the reporting period) through a combination of onsite renewable electricity generation, internal energy efficiency projects, and purchases of renewable electricity and carbon offsets. We understand that CDP guidance requests that companies not consider carbon offsets when reporting targets in C4.1. However, we have elected to report offsets to communicate these GHG emissions management activities; we have also reported additional targets that do not use offsets (see Abs1, Abs2, and Abs3). Note that the start, base, and target years reported are based on the Microsoft fiscal year. Our start year for this commitment is FY13—the first year in which we achieved carbon neutrality—and we committed to achieving carbon neutrality in all subsequent years. Because our commitment is ongoing and achieved annually, the base year (FY19) is the year prior to the target year (FY20, the reporting year). The FY19 base year emissions reported here are zero because we achieved our carbon neutral target in FY19. In FY20, Microsoft committed to shift our carbon-offsetting activity to accredited carbon removals, consistent with an emerging non-governmental organization (NGO) definition of net zero emissions. Additionally, in January 2020, Microsoft announced that, by 2030, we will become carbon negative, annually removing more emissions from the atmosphere than our total Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions combined, and by 2050, we will remove an equivalent amount of all the carbon dioxide the company has emitted either directly or by electrical consumption since it was founded in 1975. Our carbon negative commitment is covered by the net zero target (NZ1) reported in this response; as we make progress towards our net zero target, we will maintain our commitment to carbon neutrality."
"In 2020, Midsona committed to set ambitious and science-based emission reduction targets according to SBTi. Midsona submitted a target in line with SBTi's Criteria v4.2, which after careful review was approved.  We report scope 1,2 and 3 emissions based on the GHG protocol and the strict criteria to be able to get a SBT approved by SBTi. All relevant categories in all scopes have been carefully mapped. Midsona's emissions reduction targets are in line with what the latest climate science says is needed to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement. Abs1 covers GHG emissions from all Midsona's operations (scopes 1 and 2) is consistent with the reductions required to keep global warming to well-below 2°C.Midsona's emission mapping and emission targets are in line with the long-term goal of reaching zero emissions during the second half of the century (2050) and are a significant milestone for Midsona. The work is now continuing to evaluate the measures that are necessary to accelerate the reduction of Midsona's climate impact. Midsona's climate goals are:• Midsona undertakes to reduce its absolute emissions of greenhouse gases scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gases by 38 percent by 2034 from a base year 2019.• Midsona also undertakes to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by scope 3 by 38 percent within the same time frame.In 2020, Midsona acquired System Frugt in DK, increasing Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 67 tCO2e."
"In the second half of 2020, Midsona committed to set ambitious and science-based emission reduction targets according to SBTi. Midsona submitted a target in line with SBTi's Criteria v4.2, which after careful review was approved.   The SBTi encourages companies to develop scope 3 inventories, and Midsona has completed a scope 3 inventory of all relevant categories based on GHG protocol. This means a high-level evaluation to estimate the scope 3 emissions categories that are relevant to your company and indicate which ones are expected to be most significant. Midsona`s GHG emissions inventory covers all relevant GHG emissions, from all relevant sources and subsidiaries. The GHG inventory is composed exclusively of fossil based emissions, and no biogenic emissions have been reported alongside the GHG inventory. Seven of the Scope 3 categories are relevant to Midsona, and we have measured emissions from all seven categories. Midsona's value chain (scope 3) emissions reduction target meet the SBTi's criteria for ambitious value chain goals, meaning they are in line with current best practice. Midsona's emission mapping and emission targets are in line with the long-term goal of reaching zero emissions during the second half of the century (2050) and are a significant milestone for Midsona. The work is now continuing to evaluate the measures that are necessary to accelerate the reduction of Midsona's climate impact. Midsona's climate goals are:• Midsona undertakes to reduce its absolute emissions of greenhouse gases scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gases by 38 percent by 2034 from a base year 2019.• Midsona also undertakes to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by scope 3 by 38 percent within the same time frame."
"At present, Actavo are using absolute targets in setting emission reduction targets.  It is our intention to introduce intensity targets in teh coming two years following our commitment to the BITC Carbon Pledge.The reduction in emissions in 2020 over 2019 was primarily driven by a reduction in fuel usage driven by a reduction in vehicle usage both as part of a reduction in vehicle numbers and also reduction in activity due to Covid-19 impacts including lockdown in certain parts of the business."
Actavo are revising this target to be both an absolute and intensity based target.   Covid-19 had an impact on the emissions due tot he closure of a number of locations in 2020 to meet local government Covid-19 controls during lockdown.We aim to improve our consumption of electricity through A) - the procurement of electricity from sustainable sources with suitable verificationB) reduce the intensity factor through improved energy efficiency and staff training
"We receive target from The Ministry of Ecology and Environment of Shenzhen every year. In 2020, our target of carbon emission was 12845 while we only emitted 11358 tonnes, which was fully completed and did a great job."
"Since the company is in an adjustment period, it can only achieve 72% of the target."
We are targeting Net-Zero until 2050 which is inline with the government commitment to reaching Net-Zero 2050. We have committed to declare Science Based Target initiative and are planning on to develop science-based target based on its methodology  in order to meet our goal. The emission coverage from the baseline of 2015 has been limited to the buildings of our head office and owned asset only but we have extended this coverage to 77 leased offices across the nationwide + 3 other more data center where quite a portion of emission is generated in addition to the existing coverage as of 2020 for Scope 2.

"We have set a Net Zero Carbon target for Scope 1 and 2 by 2025, following a re-baselining in FY 2018/19.  This new baseline replaces our previous 2010 baseline of 35% carbon reduction by 2020 which we achieved a year early in 2018/19 with an overall reduction of 37.4%. We re-baselined the organisation to the most recent reporting year to take us forward to our new 'net zero' target for scope 1 and 2 by 2025. This new target is well ahead of any science-based target which would see our reduction of emissions to net zero by 2043. Therefore we believe this is in line with science based methodology, as it is more aggressive in its ambition to reduce carbon emissions that science based target methodology. For financial year 20/21, Mitie achieved 18,741 tonnes CO2 (market-based) meaning we have reduced our emissions by 36% since the baseline in FY18/19, beating our FY milestone target of 25,00 tonnes, and on track for our 2025 target.There is no drop down option to state our target is better than Science Based Target."
"Mitie has committed to a science-based target of net-zero supply chain (Scope 3) emissions by 2035. This target has a milestone target in 2030 of an 80% reduction. This target was set this year - Mitie set industry leading targets, and then put in the work to develop plans to achieve them. Therefore, our procurement team are now completing the work needed to identify our full, current supply chain emissions, and then a plan will be developed to enable these to be tackled and addressed, ensuring the targets set are achieved. This science-based target will be validated within the next two years, once the work stated above, and the steps necessary, have been completed.As we have not yet identified our full Scope 3 emissions, the emissions covered in this reporting year, stated above cover the following categories:WasteBusiness TravelUpstream TransportWater"
Target is Scope 1 + 2 emissions for all assessable MCHC operations within Japan. Unit: tCO2e/million yen.
"In January 2020, Mitsubishi Electric Corporation has set ambitious greenhouse gas reduction targets for 2030 and that these have been approved by the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi) as measures that will contribute towards ""Maintaining global warming below 2°C relative to pre-industrial temperatures"", a key aim of the Paris Agreement. Mitsubishi Electric Group will continue its work of many years, contributing to the realization of a sustainable future by greenhouse gas reduction throughout its wide-range of business areas.Mitsubishi Electric Group's Emission Reduction Targets are as follows.Scope 1 & 2: Mitsubishi Electric commits to reduce total scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 18% by 2030, compared to the base year of Fiscal 2017.Scope 3: Mitsubishi Electric commits to reduce total scope 3 GHG emissions by 15% by 2030, compared to the base year of Fiscal 2019.The target coverage is based on the GHG Protocol and covers 95% or more of GHG emissions from group affiliates that are under operational control.The group regards its contribution to the environment as a key management task and has published its Environmental Sustainability Vision 2050 and key Initiatives based on its Environmental Declaration and Three Environmental Action Guidelines for 2050. Respecting long term goals based on international agreements, Mitsubishi Electric Group will strive to achieve the approved targets by reducing greenhouse gas emissions throughout its value chain from procurement of raw materials to manufacturing, sales, distribution, usage, and disposal."
"Our 9th Environmental Plan. (Fiscal 2019 – 2021) was the final environmental plan for the entire group aimed at realizing the ""Environmental Vision 2021"". It had set a target of reducing annual emission of greenhouse gas to 1.47 million tons CO2 or less by Fiscal 2021. We accomplished this target, and were able to achieve a 56% reduction from the base year level, which is well over the 30% planned when the ""Environmental Vision 2021"" was formulated."
"Under its Environmental Vision 2021, Mitsubishi Electric has been carrying out initiatives to realize a low-carbon, recycling-based society that functions in harmony with nature, reflecting Mitsubishi Electric's resolve to operate as a responsible, eco-minded corporate citizen. Looking ahead to April 2021 and well beyond, the company's new Environmental Sustainability Vision 2050 positions environmental protection as an even greater corporate priority and stipulates increased initiatives toward this end. The vision establishes Mitsubishi Electric's future course for implementing key initiatives based on its Environmental Declaration and Three Environmental Action Guidelines toward 2050.As one of the priority efforts, respecting long-term goals based on international agreements, we will promote the reduction of greenhouse gases throughout the value chain, from development, design, procurement of raw materials and production through sales, distribution, use and disposal. At present, our target is to achieve net-zero CO2 emission across the value chain by 2050.This target also includes ""avoided CO2 emission from product usage"", which is the amount of CO2 that is considered to have been reduced in society outside of our scope 1, 2 and 3 by replacing conventional products with energy-saving products, introducing new products, or by contributing to energy conservation in customer products. It is CO2 reduction rate in product life multiplied by the number of units sold, defined by the following formula. Avoided CO2 emission =  ? {(energy consumption of conventional products - energy consumption when our company products are introduced) x useful life x number of units sold a year}"
This absolute emissions target is medium-term target (2030) which is approved as science-based by the Science-based Targets initiative.
This absolute emissions target is long-term target (2050) which is approved as science-based by the Science-based Targets initiative.
The MGC Group's target GHG emissions were defined as the sum of the targets of companies with a total reduction target year of 2030.

"The target value of 25.4%, the percentage reduction from the FY2005 level to be achieved by 2030, is Japan's Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC). The target value for the base year is the sum of Scope 1 and 2 emissions from Mitsui Chemicals and its domestic consolidated subsidiaries, from which electricity and steam sold to other companies were subtracted (by assuming full operation).We achieved the target set in the reporting year. However, we believe that we will need to check our production activities in the next fiscal year again because they are influenced by the economic trends. We are planning to commence discussions for setting another target, including revising the target, and will set another target."
"When the target was initially set, it only covered Japan, and the percentage of emissions from the area covered by the target to the total amount of Scope 1 and 2 emissions in Japan was 100%. However, we entered the percentage for the boundary including overseas countries.  Our target value is that of emissions calculated by subtracting electricity and steam sold to other companies from Scope 1 and 2 emissions (assuming full-scale operation). The target value has been achieved in this report. However, emissions fluctuate due to economic factors, and we plan to continue with the current target until we set the next target."
"In November 2020, Mitsui Chemicals announced that we aim to become carbon neutral by 2050. Building on this, we set a new greenhouse gas emissions reduction target in the new long-term business plan Vision 2030. We want to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 40% of 2013 levels by 2030. The reduction rate is about 3% annually, which corresponds to a WB2? level in the Science-Based Target Setting Manual."

"Target ambition: Mobimo has defined an emission reduction path by 2050, including 2 scenarios. The first, basic Scope 1 and 2 reduction-scenario is aligned with a global temperature increase well-below 2°C, the second scenario is 1.5 C-aligned. Premise/Normalization: The reduction has been calculated based on the same asset size as in 2011: 401'392 m2.Since then the asset has increased by 55.5% to 624'113 m2 in 2020 . The calculation basis is the emissions intensity of 16 kgCO2eq/m2 in 2020 x 401'392m2= 6'422 tCO2eq. Emissions in 2011: 13'931 tCO2e; Target 2025 : 5'459 tCO2e (Normalization/calculated on basis of the same asset size as by 2011).The target emissions intensity by 2025 is equal/less 13.6 kgCO?eq/m² (Total 5'559 tCO2e/same asset size as by 2011). The realized important reduction is due to an important improvement of the quality of the asset. For the calculation of the Scope 2 emissions in the French part of Switzerland (Lausanne area) and the Zurich area, the market based factor has been used for district heating and electricity. As these are renewable, low emissions energy products we buy, the absolute Scope 1 and 2 have importantly been reduced. With an emissions intensity of 16 kgCO?eq/m², the reduction target for 2020 has been achieved. The figures can be found in the Annual Report 2020, p. 21 and the Sustainability Report 2020, p.20. The Normalization of asset size is to be considered."

"We have set a target to reduce our carbon emissions across our direct operations by 50% by 2025, set against a 2016 baseline incorporating 100% of MillerCoors emissions.  As of 2020 we have reduced our absolute scope 1 and 2 emissions by 24.1%  (from 1,341,497tCO2e to 1,017,928 tCO2e ). In the summer of 2019, this target was officially approved by Science Based Targets Initiative as being consistent with the level of decarbonization required to keep average global temperature increases at 1.5°C  compared with pre-industrial levels, putting Molson Coors among the most ambitious businesses in the world on climate targets."
"We have set a target to reduce our carbon emissions across our entire value chain by 20% by 2025, set against a 2016 baseline incorporating 100% of MillerCoors emissions. As of 2020 we have reduced absolute scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions by 22.5% (from 6,863,386 tCO2e to 5,275,304 tCO2e). Molson Coors value chain emissions reduction target meets the Science-Based Targets Initiative's criteria for ambitious value chain goals, meaning we are in line with current best practice and in line with what the latest climate science says is needed to meet the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement."
Momentive has set formal GHG emission reduction goals for the period 2020-2025. Momentive has also set goals for renewable energy in our electricity mix.
"Note: In 2020, MDLZ recalculated our 2018 baseline figures due to data improvements, emissions factor updates and methodological updates.  The recalculated 2018 baseline, increased the original 2018 baseline by <1%, well below the SBTi 5% threshold that requires notification of the change. This will enable Mondel?z International to more accurately and consistently track progress against our targets in years to come. Due to this recalculation of our base year emissions in 2020, we have not begun reporting against our 2025 target. As stated on the SBTi website, in January 2020 we set our SBTi target to reduce absolute scope 1, 2, and 3 (purchased goods and services and waste generated in operations) GHG emissions 10% by 2025 from a 2018 base year. The targets covering greenhouse gas emissions from company operations (scopes 1 and 2) are consistent with reductions required to keep warming to Well-below 2°CPurchased goods and services represent on their own 81% of our scope 3 emissions, therefore together with waste generation in operations, our scope 3 targets cover above the 2/3 threshold required by the SBTi criteria. Purchased goods and services figures includes emissions from land use change as detailed in section 6.5 that details our methodology for calculating scope 3 emissions."
"In 2015, we established new 2020 sustainability goals that placed us at the forefront of the fight against climate change and support our 2020 ambition to be the leader in well-being snacks while driving down costs and creating efficiencies to accelerate our growth. We used the science-based targets methodology to set absolute CO2 from energy emissions reduction goals from manufacturing by 15% from base year 2013 as part of our ambitious end-to-end approach. We consulted with the science-based target setting organizations at the time and supported the We Mean Business coalition in 2015. However, this goal is not validated by the current SBT Initiative and does not cover Scope 3 emissions. In our Snaking Made Right 2020 Progress Report, we report our 2020 CO2 reduction goal as ""exceeded"" as we reduced carbon emissions from manufacturing by 24%."
"We reached an important milestone in 2017 in our efforts to reduce carbon footprint. For the fist time in our history, we committed ourselves to lower our scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 35% by 2020 (compared with 2016) by implementing different measures (see other question). In 2018, the target was already achieved thanks combination of measures. The main reason for carbon footprint reduction was purchasing of ''green electricity” and decrease of fuel consumption (company fleet). Based on this success, we will set a new carbon footprint reduction target in autumn 2020.  In the next four years, MONETA is committed to reduce its carbon footprint by 10% each year and become carbon neutral by the beginning of 2026."
"The year 2020 changed the way our employees work and commute to work. Distant working (""home office"")  has become the norm, which has led to a large reduction in GHG emissions in the relevant category. We want to partially preserve this way of working in the future. As part of the our ""home office"" program, we enable our employees to work 4 days a month from home based on line manager approval, up to 8 days based on Divisional leader approval and more than 8 days per month based on Management board approval. This home office policy is applicable for 2021 and will be updated by the end of 2021 again."
"We formally committed to reduce absolute Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions 50% by 2030 from a 2019 base year. The coverage of this target extends fully across the global operations of our organization. Our strategy to achieve this target is based on the commitment to procure 100% of our electricity from renewable sources and on our ongoing energy efficiency initiatives. This target has been set at a level with the goal of aligning our direct operations with an emissions trajectory of 1.5 degrees Celsius and achieving net-zero emissions no later than 2050. The targets were validated and announced in early 2020, in line with our commitment to the UN's Business Ambition for 1.5C. Base year Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions were updated from previously published values due to improvement in data quality during the digitization efforts of our inventory. The number was updated from 12,130 to 12,083 metric tons CO2e, which represents a non-material change of less than 0.5%.In 2020, we achieved and exceeded our target to reduce Scope 1 and 2 (market-based) emissions by 50% through our commitment to procure 100% renewable electricity for our global operations through energy attribute certificates. We are also conscious that a portion of this progress is attributed to reduced emissive activities due to the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent office closures. We will work to maintain these emissions reductions by the target year in the post-Covid world."
"We formally committed to reduce absolute scope 3 GHG emissions from fuel- and energy-related activities, business travel and employee commuting 15% by 2025 from a 2019 base year. The coverage of this target extends globally across our operations and addresses 100% of the emissions reported under these categories. Our strategy to achieve this target is via our ongoing sourcing of renewable electricity, reducing the carbon intensity of the fuels we use, switching to alternative technologies that enable low-carbon fuels, and via an enhanced travel policy favoring teleconferencing, lower carbon modes of travel and a flexible working policy. The targets were finalized in early 2020, in line with our commitment to the UN's Business Ambition for 1.5C. Base year Scope 3 GHG emissions were updated from previously published values due to improvement in data quality and calculations. The value was updated from 29,874 to 27,850 metric tons CO2e.In 2020, we achieved and exceeded our target to reduce Scope 3 emissions. We are conscious that a portion of this progress is attributed to reduced emissive activities due to the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent office closures, which significantly reduced business travel and employee commuting. We will work to maintain these emissions reductions by the target year in the post-Covid world."
"Normally, We are using AIR X Testing services, we have found that we are at 76%(50 % in 2020) of our rated capacity. We found that the first reduction of 40% of target reduction over 2.5 years was a quicker than the next 60%.the 10 year project is under way and attainable.2020 was a low year due reduced production due to supply needs. The COVID reduction allowed our emissions to be much lower than normal."
"A continuous sample of the exhaust gas was taken from the stack through a refrigerated sample gas conditioner transported under positive pressure through Teflon tubing to a distribution panel.Nitrogen oxides, Carbon monoxides and Oxygen were tested."
"The foundation of our commitments was to align with the Paris Climate Agreement, so we set a goal for CO2e and committed to a 50% reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 CO2e emissions.  We anticipate sending our commitment letter to SBTi in 4th Qtr 2021. The Group's absolute CO2e decreased by 23% against the baseline year. The CO2e factors for electricity by country are constant for both years. The Group's target is for scope 1 and 2 emissions. The group does not include scope 3 in targets."

"This combined scope 1 and scope 2 absolute emissions reduction target is a science-based target, which was set in 2017 and approved by the Science Based Targets Initiative. It replaced the following 2020 targets, which were on track to be significantly exceeded:  Scope 1: Reduce direct fuel consumption by 26% by 2020 against a 2010 baseline through fuel efficient choice and driving behaviour.Achieved: absolute emissions in 2016 were 8,535.36 tCO2e compared to 2010 baseline, 23,480tCO2.This represented a 63% reduction achieved compared to 26% target.Scope 1: Reduce bulk fuel purchase and use by 26% by 2020 against a 2010 baseline, through ecosite establishment, equipment selection and behaviour.Achieved: absolute emissions of 8,665.40 tCO2e in 2016 compared with 10,581tCO2e in 2010, our baseline year.This represented a 18% reduction achieved compared to 26% targetScope 2: Reduce direct electricity consumption by 26% by 2020 against a 2010 baseline, through installation of energy efficient devices and behavioural change.Achieved: absolute emissions of 6,934.73 tCO2e in 2016 compared with 25288 tCO2e in 2010, our baseline year.This represented a 27% reduction achieved compared to 26% target."

"In September 2017, Morgan Stanley announced a new goal of carbon neutrality for global operations by 2022. The goal (Abs1) covers 100 percent of global Scope 1, Scope 2 market-based, and Scope 3 business travel emissions. Morgan Stanley recognizes this target is not eligible for CDP consideration because it will involve the purchase of carbon offsets, but we are reporting it here to communicate the goal publicly and to our investors. Our additional absolute targets (Abs2 and Abs3) reported below do not involve carbon offsets and will help us achieve our broader goal of carbon neutrality."
"Abs2 results from two public targets associated with our commitment to achieve carbon neutrality for global operations by 2022. These public targets are (1) our commitment to source 100 percent of global electricity needs from renewable electricity by 2022 (See ""Renewable Energy Consumption"" in C4.2) and (2) our aim to achieve 20 percent reduction in energy usage by 2022 from a 2012 baseline, on an absolute basis (See ""Energy Usage"" in C4.2). Translated into carbon terms, these commitments cover 100 percent of our Scope 1 + 2 (market-based) emissions, and they will result in an absolute reduction of more than 90% from our base year 2012 emissions. We consider this a science-based target because it exceeds the 2.1% year-on-year emissions reductions required by CDP as well as the high-end projection of 72% absolute emissions reduction by 2050 from 2010 levels required to stay under 2 degrees Celsius outlined in IPCC Fifth Assessment Report RCP2.6."

"MUS monitor and measure its Absolute and Intensity Carbon emissions in compliance with ISO14064. The measure is verified by Achilles under the ""CEMARS"" verification. The performance is monitored against the 2008/09 base year using a 5 year rolling average."
"In the fall of 2017 Motorola Solutions engaged an external consultant to assist with updating our emission tracking and calculation process. In 2018 a new emission tracking tool was created which would allow MSI to track and report a more relevant and accurate profile of our emissions (both Scope 1+2 and Scope 3).  The previous reduction target set in 2017 RY as part of our ISO 14001 environmental management system requirements (Reduce GHG emissions 7.5% from 2016 levels by 2021 ----1.5% year over year) was revised to take into account our new emission tracking protocol and GHG calculation tool as well as any organizational trends from acquisitions and divestitures during the goal period. The reduction target was modified to be a little more ""aggressive"" (31% reduction vs. 7.5%) and mirror suggested decarbonization trends promoted by SBTi."
"Aligned to our ambition of achieving net zero carbon emissions by no later than 2040, the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) certified that this carbon emission target is aligned with a 1.5oC pathway. Mott MacDonald Group Limited commits to reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions and Scope 3 GHG emissions from fuel & energy related activities and business travel 25% by 2024 from a 2018 base year."
"We became a carbon neutral company in 2020, certified to ISO14064 and PAS2060. However, as a business, we have made a pledge to achieve net zero emissions by the end of 2040 (and we are exploring options for bringing forward that date). We plan to rise to that challenge by driving down our carbon emissions in the short, medium and long term, and as part of this improve carbon performance management. We will develop partnerships with non-governmental organisations and develop our own projects for offsetting in the longer term - enabling us to transition from carbon neutral to net zero. This means we will no longer pay third parties to cancel our carbon emissions but, with partners, become self-sufficient in doing so."

"Although the 2020 target was achieved, the majority of this reduction was due to COVID-19 related impacts such as remote work and facility shutdowns, and reduced production."
"Using science-based target methodologies, we plan to reduce our Scope 1 and Scope 2 carbon emissions by 50% by 2035 and our Scope 3 emissions by 20% by 2035, starting in 2019. Ways to achieve those targets include implementing energy-efficiency measures, increasing the use of renewables, shrinking employee commutes to their offices and business travel and reducing our footprint throughout the supply chain. Assuming we meet our carbon-reduction targets, our activities will contribute to a temperature rise below 2°C by 2100 , which is aligned with the objectives of the Paris Agreement."

"MTN has committed to Net Zero by 2040 and is in the process of finalising its 2030 interim emission reduction targets. We intend to reduce Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions on a company-wide level. We intend to submit these targets to the SBTi for approval in the next 2 years. The targets are set in line with SBTi guidance for the ICT sector."
"In 2013, we set a target to reduce energy use of our investment properties portfolio by 12% by 2023, compared to 2013 level. The base year emissions are converted based on the energy consumption of base year 2013 and emission factor of that specific year. By the end of 2020, we achieved a reduction of 15% compared with base year. Hong Kong companies are highly restricted in terms of carbon reduction as we do not have access to low carbon energy. The power grid is also not connected to other parts of the Mainland of China."
"ClAir-ISThe Clean Air Industrial Site (CLAIR-IS) program operates at MTU's headquarters in Munich. The target was, to reduce the CO2 emissions at the company's largest plant by 25% by 2020 (baseline year: 1990).In total, within the 30 years we have saved some 545,000 metric tons of CO2. That corresponds to 29%.This is how CLAIR-IS measures are calculated: 1. For the base year, we set the emissions as 100%.2. We undertake actions to save emissions such as     a) take into operation a bio fuel driven cogeneration plant     b) connect new cooling load to our well water cooling system (instead of using electric compressor cooling)     c) refurbish buildings, add new insulation     d) Reduce compressed air leaks     e) Exhibit machines completely3. We calculate the CO2-reduction effect (wherever possible: we measure)."
"MTU is committed to the Paris climate act. Therefore, the targets are derived to meet those objectives. To ensure a corporate wide coverage of the knowledge and inputs MTU establishes a function, which will coordinate the activities and targets for CO2 reductions. In 202, this central coordination focuses on the site targets of the MTU Aero Engines Headquarter and will be rolled out in 2022 to the German sites. Beyond this time schedule, it is planned to establish a plan to include the activities w.r.t. CO2 reduction to all sites, which are under operational control of MTU Aero Engines into such coordination. Whether offices or small representations will be covered is yet to be decided."

"Since 2015, Munich Re (Group) has been committed to maintaining carbon neutrality in our operational processes. We compensate unavoidable carbon emissions by purchasing carbon certificates. We follow strict requirements when selecting offsetting projects. Thus, every year we have the target to neutralise not avoidable carbon emissions. For example, at least one of the projects must meet the Gold Standard and be implemented in one of the world's least developed countries. In addition to avoiding carbon emissions, we also place a special emphasis on maintaining social standards. We primarily support projects that promote health, facilitate education, develop local infrastructure, avoid deforestation and maintain biodiversity. To achieve carbon neutrality for the financial year 2020, we obtained carbon certificates from suitable projects (CR-Report 2020, p. 79). Munich Re is a partner in the ""Alliance for Development and Climate"", launched by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development in 2018. The initiative's aim is to promote voluntary involvement in climate protection activities. It is intended to assist companies and organisations in reducing their emissions wherever possible and to compensate for the remainder by supporting effective climate protection projects in emerging and developing countries. These focuses are, for example, on developing renewable energy systems and on afforestation and forest protection. In addition to Munich Re's measures on carbon reduction, carbon removal from the atmosphere is crucial. Therefore, in 2020 we set ourselves a carbon net-zero goal by 2030 for our own operational emissions. This means that every gram of CO2 we still emit, will be removed from the atmosphere by way of financing re- and afforestation or carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects. We will gradually replace our carbon neutralisation measures with measures that remove CO2 from the atmosphere (net-zero), beginning in 2021."
"During our Investor Day in December 2020, the Munich Re Ambition 2025 was communicated, including specific portfolio goals (CO2 reduction of equities, corporates and real estate by 25-29% as well as CO2 reduction with respect to coal, by 35%, as well as oil and gas, by 25%)."
"Munters commits by 2030 to be carbon neutral at all of our locations (all Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions).  Munters will aggressively pursue reduction initiatives, Green Energy conversions where possible, and then, as a last resort, carbon credits to accomplish our goal.  This does include company vehicles."
"We have a target that we have a plan to achieve. Installing biomass heating at our production sites will overachieve the 45% reduction. The first installation is complete, the second will follow in 2022. We will have got to 29% reduction by end of 2020 and to 60% by 2023. UNSDG target descriptions:  Goal 7: Affordable and clean energy is addressed because emissions are mush lower, we use less road transport and make electricity for use on our own site; Goal 12: Responsible consumption and production: our raw materials for the biomass have to be sourced within 75miles of the plant, only from the UK, only using material that otherwise would go to rotting waste on the forest floor or be turned into sawdust and must be FSC verified; Goal 13: Climate action - we will exceed our SBT using all these initiatives"
"We acquired Sony's battery business unit in 2017F. And we increased our total emissions more than expected. This is one of the key changes defined by SBT. In accordance with the SBT regulations, we have re-set our targets for 2030 and 2050 based on 2017."
Same as mentioned on Abs 1.
"The target includes emission categories describe the source of emissions and who has primary, secondary or tertiary command over these sources: Scope 1: GHG emissions from sources that are owned or controlled by company and  Scope 2: GHG emissions resulting from the generation of electricity, heat or steam purchased by the company. We have considered 3 perspectives in order to set aspirational but also achievable emission targets: (1) Policy perspective: This is related to aspirations set by and between governments (e.g., Paris agreement, U Green Deal, Greek National Energy Plan).  EU and Greek policy makers target an emission reduction of ~50% by 2030 and carbon neutrality (-100% of emission) by 2050 (compared to 2019 levels). .  (2) Industry leaders perspective: This is related to what leading companies in sustainability are doing and aspiring. Best in class competitors typically target >50% decarbonization by 2030, and full decarbonization by 2050. (3) Mytilineos perspective: This is related to Mytilineos own unique starting position, performance, strategy and business plans. Given the different nature of our activities, we have taken into account the specificities of each business unit. For each of the BUs, we consider their current and expected baseline, characteristics of their business and  changes in the system they operate in.The target is considered science based because it complies with the requirements of Well-below 2°C aligned scenario as described in Science-Based Targets Initiative Tool and in 2021, MYTILINEOS plans to submit a Letter of Commitment to the ''Science Based Targets Initiative” for submitting the above-mentioned target regarding the reduction of its carbon dioxide emissions to external independent verification, to assure they have been calculated on a scientific basis."
"The specific target is referring to MYTILINEOS Metallurgy Business Unit  and is part of our wider carbon neutrality goal.  The base year of the target is the financial year 2019. Traditional Metallurgy is a carbon-intense activity. Although our primary aluminium production is practically a fully electrified process, already achieving massive emission reductions above 60% compared to historical levels, and a front-runner in the path of the EU industry towards climate neutrality, our Metallurgy business is determined to maximize its positive contribution to the EU and global effort against climate change. We expect the industry in Europe to decarbonize as the EU seeks to more than halve its emissions over the next decade. At the same time, our customers are increasingly demanding low-carbon aluminium and our competitors have set targets to reduce emissions. To reduce our absolute emissions, we have the following emission reduction levers: 1)  We accelerate the energy transition by sourcing 100% of our energy from RES. 2) We apply state of the art initiatives such as the digitization of our smelters, and investigate new technologies that have the potential todecline direct smelting emissions by 100% and 3) We maintain or grow our secondary aluminium production reaching 50-75ktons of production.The target is considered science based because it complies with the requirements of Well-below 2°C aligned scenario as described in Science-Based Targets Initiative Tool and in 2021, MYTILINEOS plans to submit a Letter of Commitment to the ''Science Based Targets Initiative” for submitting the above-mentioned target regarding the reduction of its carbon dioxide emissions to external independent verification, to assure they have been calculated on a scientific basis."
We could achieve the target.
"NPC has set absolute target which includes all plants in Taiwan. Base year: 2015 with 6,292,609 tons of CO2e emission; start year: 2016; target year: 2022 with a reduction of 3% compared with base year (2015) as medium-term target."
"NPC has set absolute target which includes all plants in Taiwan. Base year: 2015 with 6,292,609 tons of CO2e emission; start year: 2016; target year: 2030 with a reduction of 6% compared with base year (2015) as long-term target."
"To be consistent with NDC of the Taiwan government, NPC has established a target of reducing the GHG emission to 50% less than that in 2005 by 2050.  The GHG emission for the base year of 2005 was 6,067,965 tonsCO2e and the GHG emission in 2020 was 5,790,671 tonsCO2e. NPC will continue with emission reduction measures to reach the long-term target in the future."
"NPC has set a Scope 3 target which includes all plants in Taiwan. In the category of fuel-and energy-related activities (not included in Scope 1 or 2), NPC plans to gradually use low-carbon energy (replacing coal with natural gas). In addition, NPC is going to increase material utilizing efficiency to reduce amount used of raw materials and lower the GHG emission associated with the category of purchased goods and services. By implementing the above measures, NPC estimates to reduce Scope 3 emissions by 1%."
"NYPCB has set a company-wide absolute target to include all plants in Taiwan. The base year of the target was determined to be 2013, whereas the base year emission was 407,608 tons CO2e, and the target start year was 2019. The short-term reduction target is set to be 2022. It is expected that the reduction in 2022 will reach 4% from the base year of 2013."

It is expected that the reduction in 2030 will reach 6% from the base year of 2013."
"NYPCB has set a company-wide absolute target to include all plants in Taiwan. The base year of the target was determined to be 2020, whereas the base year emission was 410,475 tons CO2e, and the target start year is 2021. The long-term reduction target is set to be 2050. It is expected that the reduction in 2050 will reach 10% from the base year of 2020."
"NYPCB has set a company-wide scope 3 target to include all plants in Taiwan. In the aspect of use of electricity, NYPCB originally purchased electricity from Nanya Plastics Corporation. NYPCB has planned to gradually use renewable energy and further reduce 1% of scope 3 emission."
"NTC has set an absolute annual emission target of 448,216 tons CO2e in 2030 with 2018 as the base year with the emission of 403,394.4 tons CO2e and the starting year of 2019. The target is to have an emission reduction of 10% in 12 years. The GHG emission in 2020 was 467,962 tons CO2e which did not reach the target."
"2020 was our fifth-year reporting against a medium-term (10 year) science-based target (SBT) for NAB Group's global operations to decrease Scope 1 & 2 Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions for our stationary and transport energy. In 2020, we delivered a 41% reduction in Scope 1 & 2 GHG emissions from our 2015 base year for this target. The Science-Based Target Initiative is now urging organisations to align their targets to the more ambitious ''well-below 2°C” warming scenario, rather than the previous ''2°C only” scenario. As such, in 2020 we revised the Group's science-based target to align with this and included data centre emissions (both in target and in baseline), which were previously excluded due to methodology constraints. This has increased the Group's current emissions reduction target from 21% to 51% by 2025 and will increase our emissions coverage to >99% of our Scope 1 & 2. We plan to achieve the restated target of 51% through (i) the Group's commitment to procure 100% of electricity from renewable sources (zero emissions) by 2025, (ii) the reduction in energy use through decommissioning of the tri-generation unit and (iii) the consolidation of staff into energy efficient buildings. This target was informally reviewed by the Science-based Target Initiative (SBTI), who confirmed it is considered science-based. This target applies the Sectoral Decarbonisation Approach ‘Service Buildings' methodology given our emissions largely arise from office building based activities and our bank branches. NAB Group's SBT covers our global Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions across all GHGs required in the GHG Protocol Corporate Standard."
"NAB's business flights reduction target aims to reduce Scope 3 GHG emissions from business flights by 70% by 2025 from a 2019 baseline of 4,679 tonnes CO2-e. This target applies to New Zealand operations, so it covers 13.5% of the regions where NAB operates.Achievement of this target supports NAB's carbon neutral status and helps us reduce our overall GHG emissions.  In 2020, 2,918 tonnes CO2-e were produced from business flights, a 32% reduction from the baseline. Based on this, NAB is currently on track to meet the 2025 reduction target."
"We have followed the Science Based Targets (SBT) guidelines to set a target which is aligned  with limiting global warming to 1.5°C. We have therefore used the absolute emissions contraction method, meaning that we have applied a 4.2% annual linear reduction between 2019 and 2025. We have also assessed a GHG reduction target based on the Sectoral Decarbonization Approach (CDP, United Nations Global Compact, WRI & WWF, 2015), but decided to aim for the most ambitious goal."
"This target covers 100% of Group S1&2 emissions. With a 68% reduction against our 1990 baseline we have exceeded our 45% 2020 reduction target. We have changed our future targets to reflect our current performance and our role in achieving Net Zero by 2050. Our interim scope 1, 2 and 3 emission reduction target is verified by SBTi, demonstrating a clear, credible commitment to deliver our longer-term net zero strategy in line with a well below 2 °C pathway. A significant proportion of our emissions are driven by market conditions, energy demand and prevailing weather conditions giving us uncertainty in the short-term. GHG emissions for 2020/21 are around 7% higher than last year, primarily due to increase in emissions from our US power generation business, due to an increase in demand. Though the dispatch is outside National Grid's control, the units are maintained to operate as efficiently and reliably as possible. National Grid utilises Continuous Emissions Monitoring System (CEMS) to monitor its generator emissions. We still continue to challenge each of our business units to make year on year reductions in emissions."

"Combined scope 3 targets cover 100% of total scope 3 emissions, corresponding to the following categories: Purchased goods and services, Fuel and energy related activities, waste generated in operations, business travel, employee commuting, use of sold products"
"In April 2020 we achieved carbon neutrality for our scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions. In 2021 we maintained carbon neutrality and also reduced our total emissions for scope 1 and 2 prior to neutralising with our PPA carbon reduction agreement, green tariff electricity, and offsetting our scope 1 emissions. Following our recent sign up to the Net Zero Banking Alliance, and therefore our commitment to being net zero by 2050, within the next year we will explore the setting of science-based targets for scope 1, 2 and 3 to align to a net zero emissions pathway. We will disclose these targets in next year's climate-related financial disclosures."

"The reduction target set: reduce the combined scopes 1 and 2 emissions in 2025 by 26% from baseline year 2012. At the core of our target is SBTI tool v8. Our strategy to change our electricity generation mix by reducing our emitting sources and increasing the renewable installed capacity, will pay off in the medium term. At the foundation of our target is the 2030 Climate Energy Framework.Progress in time: 8 year/13 years =61.5%. Progress in emissions reduction: (26.12 MtCO2eq-15.46 MtCO2eq)/ (26.12 MtCO2eq-19,38 MtCO2eq) = 158%. Explanation: The progress made in 2020 in emissions reductions (158%) is higher than the progress in time (61.5%) due to the decrease in thermal generation in Spain in the last years that had been replaced by our own new developments in renewable generation.The compliance percentage is above the set target and indicates the good evolution of the target, although it must be clarified that compliance with the targets in previous years does not ensure compliance on the target date."
"We wanted to introduce a target of climate neutrality following the UN climate summit in Paris, where it was first mentioned. This is an emissions neutrality target by 2050. This exercise is to add all the emissions of the company (scope1, 2 and 3) and to face them against all the emissions avoided by our activity, with the aim that net emissions will be zero, i.e. our gross emissions less the emissions avoided by the activity of the company will be 0. The first year in which we assess our level of neutrality was 2015, resulting 32% (out of the total Scope 1, 2 and 3) emissions un-neutralized. It means, our overall scope 1+2+3 was 159MtCO2, and our overall avoided emissions were 108.5 MtCO2, so we have left 50.5 MtCO2 (32%) to neutralize, or through reducing our emissions or increasing our neutralization activity. Our goal is to be neutral by 2050, and year by year we will be assessing this neutrality performance in order to track this progress. As a gas distribution company, out of our overall scope 3 emissions in 2020, 75 % are due to the final use of natural gas from our clients, so the more natural gas we distribute or commercialize, the more our scope 3 increases. On the other hand, our clients can use the natural gas we have distributed or commercialized to reduce their emissions by displacing other fossil fuels as coal, fuel oil and gasoil, and even, by this way they could meet your eligibility criteria for their scope 1 emissions.Progress in time: 6 year/35 years =17.1%. Progress in emissions reduction: (93%-68%)/ (100%-68%) = 78% 9,999,550 tCO2eq to be neutralized in 2020/ 50,521,365 tCO2eq to be neutralized in 2015 = 80.2%. Explanation: The progress made in 2020   in emissions neutrality is higher than the progress in time due to an increase in natural gas commercialization that increased also the emissions avoided by displacing other more carbon intensive fossil fuels."
"The reduction target set: an average reduction of 17.8% in the 2013-2030 period from baseline year 2012. Following a linear reduction this objective is equivalent to reduce the combined scopes 1 and 2 emissions in 2030 by 32%. Our strategy to change our electricity generation mix by reducing our emitting sources and increasing the renewable installed capacity, will pay off in the medium term. At the foundation of our target is the 2030 Climate Energy Framework.Progress in time: 8 year/18 years =44.4%. Progress in emissions reduction: (26.12 MtCO2eq-15.46 MtCO2eq)/ (26.12 MtCO2eq-17.82 MtCO2eq) = 128 %. - Explanation: The progress made in 2020 in emissions reductions (128%) is higher than the progress in time (44.4%) due to the decrease in thermal generation in Spain in the last years that had been replaced by our own new developments in renewable generation. Therefore, the progress expected in the next years should be much closer to the level of completion in time."
"The reduction target set is aligned with the Strategic Plan 2018-2022: reduce the combined scopes 1 and 2 emissions in 2022 by 21% from baseline year 2017. At the core of our target is the scenario defined by SBTI for 1.5º: CSR1.5 IPCC (1.5ºC). Our strategy to change our electricity generation mix by reducing our emitting sources and increasing the renewable installed capacity, will pay off in the medium term. At the foundation of our target is the Strategic Plan 2018-2022.Progress in time: 3 year/5 years =60.0%. Progress in emissions reduction: (21.85 MtCO2eq-15.46 MtCO2eq)/ (21.85 MtCO2eq-17.26 MtCO2eq) = 126%. Explanation: The progress made in 2020 in emissions reductions (126%) is higher than the progress in time (60.0%) due to the decrease in thermal generation in Spain in the last years that had been replaced by our own new developments in renewable generation.The compliance percentage is above the set target and indicates the good evolution of the target, although it must be clarified that compliance with the targets in previous years does not ensure compliance on the target date."
"We reset our global emissions target in 2016, using a science-based method. We have exceeded our target, with a 73% reduction in emissions at the end of 2020. This target has now been succeeded by our Climate Positive by 2025 target (see below)."
"We have exceeded our business travel target, with a 90% reduction in emissions at the end of 2020. This target has now been succeeded by our Climate Positive by 2025 target (see below)."
"NatWest Group achieved Net Zero Carbon across our own operations in 2020. We achieved this through a combination of emissions reductions, in line with our 1.5-degree science-based target commitment, alongside offsetting residual Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions through the purchase of internationally recognised TIST Carbon Credits. We plan to achieve Climate Positive by continuing to reduce emissions 25% by 2025 against a 2019 baseline, while maintaining carbon offsetting at 2019 residual levels.Due to the exceptional nature of 2020, we have already reduced our emissions by 33% in 2020."
La meta continua siendo trabajada para conseguir nuevos objetivos en el 2018 con base ne los resultados del 2017
"NCC is an active signatory of the Fossil Free Sweden ""Roadmap for fossile-free competitiveness for the Construction industry"". Fossil Free Sweden was initiated by the Swedish government ahead of Paris 2015 as part of the UN Action Agenda. One of the targets in the Roadmap is 50% reduction in absolute scope 1+2+3 emissions (except the use-phase where the industry has little influence). The use phase stands for 31% of NCCs scope 3 as calculated and presented in C6.5. Therefore the % emissions in scope are 69% (100-31=69%). Base year emissions estimated to 7800 000 ton CO2e in total (scope 1+2 2015 = 312 000 ton CO2e and scope 3 is estimated to be 96% of total scope 1+2+3). The target is currently only set for the Swedish operations, corresponding to 62% of NCCs turnover. 62% of 7800000ton CO2e =4836 000 ton CO2e. 69% of 4836 000= 3337 000 ton CO2e. Covered emissions in reporting year are scope 1+2+3 (except the use-phase) for the Swedish operations. Baseline emissions have been recalculated due to increased accuracy. As a lot of our scope 3 emissions are estimated at this point, the result of the calculations above shows the effect of a slightly lower production volume during 2020. We have set specific scope 3 targets from 2021 and onwards that will enable us to work progressively towards lowering our main scope 3 contributors."
"A 5% reduction of the consumed environmental aspects (water, electricity, air emissions, waste, gas, sewage, chemical substances) compared with 2020."
"We have revised the target from well below 2? level to 1.5? level and the revised target was approved by SBTi in April, 2021.We are making steady progress in reducing emissions through the implementation of energy-saving measures."
"We have revised this target so that emission of tier 2 and higher suppliers can be included. This revised target was approved by SBTi in April, 2021.We are making steady progress in reducing emissions through the following measures: First, we will work with our suppliers to reduce category1 emission through the annual survey via CDP supply chain program, a recognition/award program, etc. Second, the reduction of our scope1&2 will lead to the reduced category3 emission. Third, we will improve energy efficiency of our products to reduce the category11 emission."
"The previous reduction target was achieved ahead of schedule and a new target was set at a 35% decrease, based on end-of-2013 values, by the end of 2025. This new target amounts to 5.25 tCO2e per full time employee (FTE). It is important to note that some targets and achievements are disclosed in the Nedbank TCFD report as normalized figures, but Nedbank uses absolute figures and targets. Furthermore, the bank's long-term goals are being aligned to the United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), which includes scenario analysis and potentially Science Based Targets, but this is still an on-going endeavour. One reasons for this is that the applicability of the Science Based Target Initiative (SBTI) model is still being investigated. Nedbank is also operationally carbon neutral. The internal actions and carbon neutrality is considered to be over and above what is necessary for a science based target. The coverage of the carbon footprint and carbon neutral endeavour is 100% of the operational carbon footprint."
The target is financial year based.Long term target is to become carbon neutral before 2050.
"The target is to reduce emissions in upstream and downstream logistics (23,84% of Scope 3) by 20 % by 2025 from the base year 2019."
The target is to reduce Neles' Scope 1 emissions globally by 25 % by 2030 from the base year 2019.
"The global Group is committed to reducing the absolute GHG losses of Scopes 1, 2 and 3 of the Group by 43% by 2030 compared to the 2017 base year. This target is included in the main shareholder's commitment validated by the Science-Based Targets initiative ( SBTi). The target was set in 2019 and revised in 2020. The achievement of the global Group' s goal is the result of efforts to reduce emissions in each country. In its Policy against Climate Change, Neoenergia reinforces its commitment to reducing emissions, which is monitored by the Group through Neoenergia's GHG Emissions Inventory, published annually and audited by a third party."
"Every year Shenzhen government will set and give the carbon intensity target to our company, The designated base year is 2013 . We have to achieve it, or we will need to buy carbon credit from the market.we believe the annual target that Shenzhen government set must be a science-based target, because it's actually the amount of our pre-allocated carbon emission allowance of the year."
"NEPI Rockcastle aims to contribute  to a more sustainable environment,  by reducing the carbon (CO2) footprint of its buildings during both construction and operation.  In 2020, the Group decreased its CO2 footprint by 20% compared to 2019, however, a part of this may be attributed to the reduced operations of the shopping centers. In the scale of global emissions by economic sector, the Group's activity is generating direct emissions mainly through energy consumption (electricity and gas) for heating and cooling, waste disposal and indirect emissions from the transportation used by its visitors. NEPI Rockcastle discharges mainly gas emissions generated by the HVAC equipment in its properties. Such emissions are kept under control and verified according to the law, while no incompliance with maximum legal emissions has been reported. The Group performs regular maintenance and technical verifications of its equipment, and it is committed to investing in new technologies that minimize negative impact on the environment. The Group's sustainability strategy sets ambitious targets for the next decade of activity, the main and most important being to achieve net zero carbon emissions until 2030, materially adjusting the previous target of carbon footprint reduction by 20%. The decision comes in the vanguard of the European Union's plan to make Europe the first climate-neutral continent by 2050. The Group made a long-term  commitment to become carbon neutral by 2030, with the following measures to be implemented: Implement carbon footprint calculation methodology in line with ISO 14064 principles, replace old equipment with new more energy efficient equipment, continue to implement and upgrade LED lighting and sensors solutions, invest in green energy sources such as solar panels, photovoltaic parks and electrical cars charging facilities, use alternative low carbon emission materials and last but not least, deploy a carbon offsetting strategy and implement innovative technical solutions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions."
"Neste's purpose is to create a healthier planet for our children. We do this by offering renewable and circular solutions to our customers. But what is more, we also need to commit to reducing the direct climate impact of our own activities. Therefore, we have set a concrete milestone to reach carbon neutral production (Scope 1&2)  by 2035. This is an enormous undertaking, one which will require new ways of thinking, innovation and plenty of cooperation. To align with latest climate science and the objectives of the Paris Agreement, Neste is targeting a 50 % reduction in its absolute Scope 1&2 emissions by 2030  (compared to 2019). Neste believes that this target is aligned with the 1.5°C ambition pursued in the Paris Agreement.By the end of 2020, approximately 80 different measures and actions have already been identified for decreasing GHG emissions from our production. Some of the identified key actions have already been started. These actions include for example using more renewable electricity, and aiming for 100 % share of renewable electricity by 2023. In addition, we are also working together with our suppliers to enable them to utilize renewable energy sources and reduce emissions related to production steam and hydrogen supplied to Neste.In 2020, Neste updated its investment criteria to support the key actions on the roadmap. These criteria include mandatory evaluation of the GHG impact of the investment, as well as introducing an internal price for emissions. The updated investment criteria will support prioritization of different investments needed to reduce emissions. The key investments needed include further improving our energy efficiency by optimizing the use of fuel gas, electricity, hydrogen and steam in our production. Innovative new technologies are critical to make the transformation to carbon neutral production successful, and will require longer development efforts from piloting to scaling up the solutions to the commercial scale. Together with our partners, we are actively looking into new technologies and solutions to turn them into reality. These technologies include for example carbon capture, storage and utilization (CCS/U) and producing renewable hydrogen by using electrolysis technology or from biogas."
"There are no relevant exclusions in the target.Neste has made a commitment to the efficiency program for Finland's energy-intensive industries. During the agreement period 2017–2025, we aim at saving 500 GWh from the 2014 level. In 2020, we contributed 33 GWh of savings. Total verified savings between 2017-2019 are 110 GWh.We used our base year energy consumption 12.7 TWh and gross emission (scope 1 + location-based scope 2) 3,586,000 tCO2, to calculate the emission reduction long-term target for these energy saving measures. In 2014, the emission intensity was 282 tCO2/GWh.500 GWh x 282 tCO2/GWh = 141,181 tCO2141,181 tCO2 / 3,586,000 tCO2 x 100 % = 4 % (and therefore the emission reduction target is set to 4%, which is mathematically derived and not the target itself). We have achieved  110 GWh out of our 500 GWh saving target (=22%). Therefore the status is ""Underway"" and not achieved."
"Neste's purpose is to create a healthier planet for our children. We do this by offering renewable and circular solutions to our customers. But what is more, we also need to commit to reducing the direct climate impact of our own activities. Therefore, we have set a concrete milestone to reach carbon neutral production (Scope 1 & 2)  by 2035. This is an enormous undertaking, one which will require new ways of thinking, innovation and plenty of cooperation. Neste also has a longer term target to reduce absolute Scope 1 & 2 by 65 % by 2035 compared to 2019 (the interim target is to reduce them by 50% by 2030). Neste believes that this target is aligned with the 1.5°C ambition pursued in the Paris Agreement.Neste climate targets are not approved by the Science Based Targets initiative because SBTi guidance for Oil & Gas sector have not yet been defined, and Oil & Gas cannot companies cannot get an SBTi approval without the sector-specific guidance."
"In 2020, Neste committed to reducing and compensating emissions from its employee business flights through the use of the company's own sustainable aviation fuel (Neste MY Sustainable Aviation Fuel). Neste MY Sustainable Aviation Fuel reduces emissions by up to 80 % compared to fossil jet fuel over the lifecycle. The commitment will be implemented through aviation partnerships. Neste has already joined KLM's corporate biofuel program in 2019. In addition, we announced our partnership with Finnair in March 2020. To fulfill this commitment for 2020, Neste has put in place arrangements to supply approximately 500 metric tons of SAF in Europe and North America to the airlines most frequently used by Neste (including Finnair), leading to an estimated GHG emission reduction of 1,500 tons of CO2 equivalent globally compared to using fossil jet fuel over the life cycle. No regulatory incentives have been claimed for the supplied SAF, and thus the achieved emission reduction is incremental to that achieved by any governmental policies.Neste does not report Scope 3 Category 6 emissions separately in the Annual Report, but they have been estimated based on travel management data for 2020. Neste MY Sustainable Aviation Fuel reduces emissions by up to 80 % compared to fossil jet fuel over the lifecycle, so the absolute reduction target for Neste's estimated business travel emissions is 80 % of the baseline."

"As part of our corporate strategy to reduce energy we set out to reduce electricity consumption in North America by 20% within five years compared to the base year of 2016. The electricity consumed by our North American operations constitutes approximately 70% of Scope 2 emissions. We have reduced Scope 2 emissions in this category by  36,800 tCO2e, meeting over 226% of the goal within 5 years. The largest impact to the reduction is the relocation and consolidation of our lab and data center equipment to more efficient facilities which reduced the overall energy consumed."
"This target covers our SA and Lesotho operations which are accountable for 100% of our Scope 2 emissions. Netcare has committed to set targets that are in line with the Science Based Target Initiative (SBTi), the Paris Agreement and the COP21 Sustainable Development Goals to keep global warming below 2°C. To meet our Scope 2 target, we will continue to expand our PV network and invest in renewable energy, investigate fuel cell technology and actively source renewable sources that are available over the national and local electricity grids to supplement the potential shortfall in implementation of the Integrated Resource Plan.  Netcare are aiming to use 100% of its energy from renewable energy sources by 2030. Netcare has further committed to achieve zero waste to landfill by 2030"

We do not update our calculation of every Scope 3 category each year. In 2017, Scope 3 accounted for 97% of our total GHG, primarily driven by Category 1 purchased goods and services. In 2020, we updated Category 1.  Note that some other categories of Scope 3 were heavily impacted by COVID closures and restrictions, e.g. employee commuting and business travel, and would be even lower than is shown here."

New Kinpo Group raised 7.8% GHG emission from 2017 to 2020 was due to add more company shuttle bus.
The SBTi approved our targets in June 2021.  Our targets were validated as being well below 2 degree and our Scope 1 and 2 emission targets were increased to greater than 30% reduction (32% reduction) by 2030 from a 2018 baseline.  Our Scope 3 target is 30% reduction  by 2030 from a 2019 baseline.
"In 2018, we established our short (2020), medium (2030) and long-term (2050) GHG reduction targets. We have reported the medium-term GHG reduction target above. When setting our targets, we used the Sectoral Decarbonization Approach to align with the Science-Based Targets to limit average global warming to 2°C. Our intention was to set ambitious targets in line with the latest climate science data, which form part of our approach of managing our risk exposure to climate change and provide long-term resilience for our business.Since we set our targets, the volume of scientific studies and climate science data has increased, and findings updated. Drawing on the latest IPCC Special Reports, we recognise that we must do more to hold off some of the worst climate impacts. To that end, we are reviewing our medium and long-term targets and the new technical resources published by the SBTi in 2019 to update our targets from the 2°C scenario to well below 2°C or 1.5°C. This is in line with the most ambitious goal under the Paris Agreement – 1.5°C and our Net Zero strategy."

"After exceeding its previously set science-based target, News Corp has raised its ambition and has committed to a science-based target (aligned to 1.5 degrees C) to reduce absolute Scopes 1 & 2 GHG emissions 60% by FY 2030 from a FY 2016 base year. We also have signed and committed to the Business Ambition for 1.5C pledge to be net zero emissions by 2050."
"As part of its science-based emissions reduction commitment under the SBTi, News Corp commits to reduce absolute Scope 3 GHG emissions 20% by FY 2030 from a FY 2016 base year, across all relevant categories (purchased goods and services, capital goods, fuel and energy related activities, upstream transportation and distribution, waste generated in operations, business travel,  employee commuting, downstream transportation and distribution, and end-of-life treatment of sold products). We have also signed and committed to the Business Ambition for 1.5C pledge to be net zero emissions by 2050. During 2020, we performed a more detailed analysis of our scope 3  value chain, which does not align completely with our previous initial analysis performed for base year 2016, thus the discrepancy in scope 3 emissions. In June 2021, we partnered with EDF's Climate Corps program to perform a deeper dive into our scope 3 emissions to develop more accurate data using supplier-specific emissions factors.  This project will also help us align our 2016 base year emissions to more accurately reflect our entire supply chain."
"Nexans worked in 2020 to set a Science-Based Target. The process is ongoing to launch the letter helped by consulting company. A working group composed of different CSR and R and D functions collaborates with an external expert group. In 2020, Nexans committed to contribute to Carbon Neutrality, Nexans could achieve a reduction aligned with the 1,5°C trajectory on its commitment perimeter according to the contraction method (method recommended by SBT and appropriate for Nexans falling under the category ""other sectors""). The current reduction path is therefore compatible with 1,5 degrees. In 2020, we established new targets, based on 2019 emissions (2019 base-year). These new targets have a Company-wide coverage. They cover: Scope 1+2 (location-based) +3 (upstream & downstream): Upstream Transport, Downstream transport, Business Travel, Employee Commuting, Waste. For a specific focus on scope 1 and 2, the emissions emitted in 2019 for this perimeter of engagement was 344,381 (= 130,017 + 214,364) tons CO2e. We target to reduce 2019 absolute emissions by 4,2% per year up to 2030 on this specific perimeter of engagement, meaning during eleven years, which is to say 46,2% in total from 2019 base-year to 2030 target-year. This is why the emissions for target year 2030 would be 185,277 (=344,381*(1- 46,2%). For the reporting year 2020, we emitted 232,391 (= 94,802 + 137,589) tons CO2e. Meaning 70,38% (=344,381-232,391)/(344,381-185,277) of target achieved so far. See associated figures into URD 2020, page 180. The 46.2% reduction target also applies to certain scope 3 items, elating to business travel, employee commuting, waste produced, as well as upstream and downstream Transport."
"Nexen Tire has reduced GHGs emissions in 2020 compared to 2019. Nexen Tire has set a reduction target to reduce GHGs emissions to 50% of 2019 emissions by 2030.

"In 2019 we announced our new commitment to reduce Scope 1 & 2 absolute carbon emissions by 50% by 2030, against a 2016/17 reporting year baseline. This reporting year we extended the target to 55% to align with SBTi 1.5°C pathway using the absolute contraction method, requiring a linear reduction of 4.2% a year."
"Reducing CO2 emissions to mitigate climate change is a key global issue. Many countries and companies around the globe are seeking to build carbon-neutral societies and are committed to reduce CO2 emissions throughout the supply chain.Reducing CO2 emissions is a critical issue for our group as a manufacturing company, and it is our responsibility to accomplish the goal.The Group has set targets for each fiscal year, and in June 2020 during the reporting year of 2020 (April 2020 to March 2021), the new target ""Scope 1 & 2 will be changed to 2030 compared to 2018. Since we have formulated ""30% reduction"", we answered ""2021"", which is the year of the end of the fiscal year, in the ""Year of setting targets"" column.This target setting is consistent with the well-below 2 ° C level (a level well below 2 ° C) aimed at ""keeping the temperature rise after the Industrial Revolution within 2 ° C"" under the Paris Agreement.Setting forth the CO2 emissions reduction targets by 2030 toward the goal of attaining carbon neutrality by 2050, we will first work on Scopes 1 and 2, which we can directly control. We set targets to be consistent with the objective of ""holding the temperature increase to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels"" in the Paris Agreement. We will make company-wide efforts to take proactive actions looking ahead to achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. The CO2 Management Committee led by the Executive Officer, which people involved from all businesses join, will manage the progress.The results also will be reviewed by the Central Environment Committee, which is also attended by the president."
"NH Hotel Group (NH HG) is implementing programs to reduce carbon footprint since 2008. During 2019, in order to take its commitment a step further, NH HG has decided to align its corporate voluntary greenhouse gas reduction targets with The Science Based targets initiative (SBTi) approving, in September 2019, long-term absolute emissions target: to reduce absolute scope 1, 2, and 3 GHG emissions 20% by 2030 from a 2018 base year. NH became the first Spanish hotel company to establish emission reduction targets validated by the SBTi.This target marks out NH HG's roadmap towards a significant reduction in the carbon footprint of its activity in the coming years, aligned with the goal set out in the Paris Agreement to limit the increase in global temperature to less than 2ºC, and join the efforts being made globally towards the transition to a low-carbon economy. To achieve our carbon climate commitment, we are working along 4 lines: Energy efficiency - Works oriented to improve the efficiency in energy consumption and the associated costs, since changes in equipment, where the replacement involves greater efficiency, to investments related to control of installations, or actions on facades that represent improvements in the building envelope and in insulation.Cleaner energy - Installation of renewable energies for own consumption and increasing green energy purchasing until 100%Offsetting strategy with a double purpose. First, to develop products and services, and to identify processes, that we can offset the emissions they generate, even though carbon credits from a project which complies with our social commitment. Second, to offset emissions until your annual target was reached if it could not be achieved with your initial plan.Carbon Due diligence – Implementing Carbon Due Diligence procedures to be incorporated into the decision-making process for new acquisitions and contractsThe exceptional and irregular operating conditions of the hotels since March and throughout the rest of the year are reflected in NH Hotel Group's carbon footprint data. Absolute emissions decrease in all scopes due to the decrease in activity, and consequently in consumption."
"In September 2019, NH Hotel Group approved and announced that it will reduce its carbon emissions by 20% by 2030 (avoiding the emission of more than 70,000 metric tons of CO2 into the atmosphere). With it the Company became the first Spanish hotel company to establish emission reduction targets that have been scientifically validated by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi).NH Hotel Group has undergone an analysis of its emissions, which has allowed them to know that the Category Purchase of Goods and Services of Scope 3 is the one that generates the most volume of emissions, that is why it is in this category where the most actions are wanted to be carried out.  In spite of ""Purchased goods and services"" is the main contributor to NH scope 3 emissions, the following scopes are also included in the calculation:? Scope 3: Capital goods? Scope 3: Fuel and energy-related activities (not included in Scopes 1 or 2)? Scope 3: Upstream transportation and distribution? Scope 3: Waste generated in operations? Scope 3: Business travel? Scope 3: Employee commuting? Scope 3: Upstream leased assets? Scope 3: FranchisesThis target marks out NH Hotel Group's roadmap towards a significant reduction in the carbon footprint of its activity in the coming years, aligned with the goal set out in the Paris Agreement to limit the increase in global temperature to less than 2ºC, and join the efforts being made globally towards the transition to a low-carbon economy. Achieving these goals involves, among many other measures:- An exhaustive analysis of the opportunities to continue working with suppliers and together reduce the carbon footprint. In 2019 and 2020, the suppliers with the largest carbon footprint have been identified and we will work with them to improve reporting channels and to seek alignment to reduce emissions in the value chain.- Continuing to contract green energy and reinforcing energy efficiency in the hotels.The exceptional and irregular operating conditions of the hotels since March and throughout the rest of the year are reflected in NH Hotel Group's carbon footprint data. Absolute emissions decrease in all scopes due to the decrease in activity, and consequently in consumption"
"In 2014, Korean government established a roadmap to achieve the national GHG reduction and by 2015, the government implemented the emission trading system, and submitted Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDC); 37% reduction from expected emissions in 2015 and in 2030.

"For scope3, we have set a target in 3 categories, ""Purchased goods and services"", ""Upstream transportation and distribution"" and ""Use of sold products"". This target covers 80% or more of total Scope 3 emissions.""Purchased goods and services"" is the largest source of Scope 3 emissions from Nikon. In this category, we implement GHG reduction measures focusing on Imaging Products Business and Precision Equipment Business, which always occupies 80% or more of our company's sales composition  (However, in FY 2020, it was about 74% due to the pandemic of the COVID-19). In the Imaging Products Business, whose main products are cameras and lenses, we will reduce GHG emissions by reducing the weight and size of our products. The Precision Equipment Division, whose main products are FPD lithography systems and semiconductor lithography systems, we will reduce the GHG emissions by improving the functions of parts through technological development, reducing the number of parts and downsizing parts. Furthermore, we reduce GHG emissions per part by instructing our suppliers to manufacture parts more efficiently.Regarding countermeasures in ""Upstream transportation & distribution"", in addition to promoting modal shift, we streamline the transportation route. We are also improving the loading efficiency of our cargo and reducing GHG emissions. 99% of the emissions of ""Use of sold products"" is the emissions from product use of the Precision Equipment Business. Approximately half of the power consumption of Precision Equipment Business products is due to exposure light source units. Therefore, we will develop an exposure light source unit with lower power consumption and reduce GHG emissions. In FY 2020, GHG emissions from these three categories decreased significantly compared to the previous year. We analyze that this is due to the significant decrease in production by the pandemic of the COVID-19, and the shrinking camera market. Our GHG reduction in FY2020 decreased more than the target (31% reduction compared to FY 2013), but it was the result of the special circumstances described above, so that we have not changed our target at present. Scope3 is expected to increase again as the society gets recovered from the effects of the COVID-19 and our sales also expand in all segments, but we will further strengthen our measures to achieve our target."
"For Scope 1 and 2, we have set and committed to a science-based target, which is as follows: Minimum 35% reduction in total absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 2030, compared to 2018 baseline year"

"The Science Based Target proposal was submitted to the SBTi in August 2019 and confirmed as verified in October 2019.  Nippon Sheet Glass Co., Ltd.'s target for scope 1 and 2 emissions is a reduction of absolute emissions 21% by 2030 from a 2018 base year, which exceeds the minimum ambition for 2°C pathway defined by the absolute contraction approach and is therefore considered ambitious.Nippon Sheet Glass's base year scope 3 emissions are not more than 40% of its total emissions. Therefore, Nippon Sheet Glass is not required to set a scope 3 target.2019 was an exceptional year across NSG Group operations for emissions associated with the Covid19 pandemic.  As a result of the pandemic, utilisation across the operational base was restricted according to customer demand.  The impact for absolute carbon emission from this reduced level of utilisation is reflected in the lower level of absolute emissions reported.  Activities for decarbonisation across the operations continued during the year according to the defined roadmap.   However, it is important to recognise that the emission reduction reported above is associated with a combination of decarbonisation activities and reduced operational utlisation."

"Our target is to reduce Scope 1, 2, and 3 GHG emissions by 30% by 2030. This is aligned to the UNFCCC and our commitments to The Fashion Pact. A VERY IMPORTANT EXPLANATION OF OUR PROGRESS ON ABSOLUTE EMISSIONS as it relates to 2018, 2019, and 2020:Our First Year to ever analyze our emissions was in 2018, and in 2019 we published our Group's first Sustainability Report using 2018 figures verified by an independent third-party (Deloitte) and published on our website.  Our 2018 emissions were limited to Scope 1 and 2 but EXCLUDED  our fully-owned China facility and the production facility where we outsource production in Mexico. This is important to note because about 50% of Group revenues are generated at this Mexico facility. In 2020 (reporting period for this questionnaire), we continued to dig into and analyze our global emissions. We continue only to measure Scope 1 and 2 and have been able to include emissions from China operations. HOWEVER, the Mexico facilities that generate about 50% of our revenues are still owned by a third party, which, as we understand and have been confirmed by the Consultants who advise us, should be treated as Scope 3 emissions and are thus NOT INCLUDED in 2020 emissions."
"Target achievement  of 99% already in 2020, relates to the COVID-19 effect. During 2020 we decreased our business travel by more than expected. We aniticipate that there will be some increase of emissions going forward, but that we will reach our science-based target."
we set the target to reduce 2% of CO2 emission on yearly basis until in 2025.
"We updated our SBT target to follow 1.5°C aligned ambition at the end of 2020.  We will track and report progress against our updated targets from 2021 data onward. Nokia submitted this target in April 2017 to the Science-Based Targets Intiative (SBTi), and SBTi approved the target in June 2017. We are on track with the target and this progress is externally assured as part of our sustainability assurance. The assurance report is available in our People & Planet 2020 report.In our Science Based Target (SBT), we wanted to include also car fleet emissions, but reporting for the car fleet emissions started only in 2015.  Hence car fleet emissions from 2015 (44 900 tonnes) were used as a proxy for 2014 car fleet emissions to calculate the total Scope 1 emissions for the base year 2014. This explains why the total Scope 1 emissions reported for 2014 in our People & Planet report are 44 900 tonnes smaller than the base year 2014 emissions included in our SBT.We report 100% of emissions in our annual sustainability report People & Planet, but our SBT target coverage is 98% as it excludes following minor facility related emission sources: Emissions from hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerants, Emissions from fire suppression system losses, and Emissions from purchased cooling."
"We updated our SBT target to follow 1.5°C aligned ambition at the end of 2020.  We will track and report progress against our updated targets from 2021 data onward. Scope 3 emissions included in our SBT are on track and are assured by a third-party.We have set a Science Based Target (SBT) for 2030 (base year 2014) to reduce by 75% our Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions caused by the emissions from customer use of our sold products. We concentrate on the long-term trend line, as product development takes time and is a step by step process. The trend line is not linear and we can see that emissions are relatively stable during the first years but eventually decrease over time.Energy consumption and related GHG emissions from the products that we sold in 2020 were on track, and more specifically below the maximum allowed emissions in order to stay on track for 2020. This is due to significant energy efficiency improvements in our new products but also due to lower sales volumes of the products that are in the scope of our SBT Scope 3 target.  Compared to the previous product generation, the energy efficiency improvements in our new product families result in much higher capacity for a small increase in energy consumption. The energy efficiency has increased by adding new power saving features."

"Our ambition is to reduce carbon emissions from our internal operations by 30% by 2023 and more than 50% by the end of 2030 compared to 2019 and achieve net positive carbon contribution in 2030 (through offsetting). We consider this target 1,5C aligned through comparing with trajectories from IPCC SR 1.5, UNEP Emissions Gap Report, Business Playbook for 1,5 degrees and SBTi criteria for SMEs. Covered emissions are the full carbon footprint for internal operations as reported annually from 2019 and which includes carbon emissions from our operations in Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden, Poland, Estonia and Luxembourg because this is where we have our main operations and where we have operational control. This covers 99% of our employees. Data for fuel and energy consumption includes headquarters, head offices and data centres. Also included is car use, business travel, postal services, paper and water consumption. Branch offices energy use is not included because we have some challenges in retrieving correct data for those. Our ambition is to include them as soon as we have reliable data. Already in 2019 we reduced our total carbon footprint, despite an increase in scope to also include postal services, paper and water. Following this reduction, our total emissions of 15,898 tonnes CO2e in 2020 marked a 62% reduction from 2019 even though waste was added to the scope in 2020. The reduction in carbon emissions was mainly due to Nordea's travel policy in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The reduction will continue going forward, even though we expect business travel activities to increase somewhat in 2021 from the significantly low levels in 2020."
"The target applies to emission reduction for Nordic's purchased electricity for offices and lab facilities. Emission reduction by switching to renewable energy (backed by renewable energy attributes), is expected to be achievable for some of the company's office locations. Prioritized are the larger ones (e.g. in Norway, Philippines, Taiwan, Poland), while renewable energy instruments for smaller offices with few employees in rented office areas (e.g. 2 employees in Seoul office) will be difficult or even impossible to achieve. At the same time, the company is growing year after year, and we see new offices and branches of the company being opened all around the world. A long term target to continue emission reduction from Scope 1+2 is  helpful to maintain focus on this."
"Scope 1 emissions from Nordic Semiconductor in 2020 came from the usage of refrigerant gas R-404A in climatic chamber in T&V laboratory in Trondheim. As based on the information received from the service provider handling service and calibration activities of the lab equipment in Nordic Semiconductor's lab, the consumption of refrigerant R-404A was 1 kg in 2020. The consumption was due to the leakage in the refrigerant system on the climatic chamber. The leakage has been repaired and there hasn't been any emission in 2021. R-404A is a blended hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) refrigerant comprised of R-125, R-134a, and R-143a with GWP of 3922. Nordic Semiconductor has implemented policies and controls to ensure only certified service personnel are working on the lab equipment/gas, as well as controls to detect and prevent gas leakage in the future."
"Target was to purchase Guarantee of Origin certificate for renewable energy in office facility Trondheim, Norway. This office location is the largest office facility of Nordic Semiconductor, and consumes about 50% off all Nordic's scope 2 energy consumption (MWh). Target and related work was initiated in 2019, involving other stakeholders and landlord for the local office facilities. Target has been progressed by ensuring renewable energy for electricity consumption of our Trondheim office facility in 2020. Remaining is only a small contribution from district heating for the facility, which is already composed of 94.5% renewable energy. With less than 0.5% remaining of the original target, we consider this goal achieved and chose to focus on other reduction initiatives for the future."
"Nordic Semiconductor's significant emissions are related to the outsourced manufacturing of our products. These Scope 3 emissions are closely related to production volume, as well as our subcontractors' capacity utilization in production, and will to some extent fluctuate beyond our control. Production facilities may need to operate machinery and infrastructure, even in the event of low production, leading to greater emission per production unit. In 2020 Nordic Semiconductor initiated a Renewable Energy Program for suppliers as a response to customers' interest and requests for GHG emissions reduction and renewable energy usage in production. The plan is to work with our manufacturing partners to reduce GHG emissions by increasing the ratio of renewable energy and exploring other environmental instruments such as renewable energy certificates or carbon offsets in the manufacturing processes."
This is a Location specific Target. Calculated based on paint consumption. Estimated paint fume reduction.
"NORMA Group set a Scope 1 and 2 absolute reduction target to reduce its Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 19.5% until 2024. This goes beyond the target for well-below 2°C which is recommended in the absolute contraction approach by the Sbti. Currently, there is a review on whether to further increase reduction efforts due to current climate science. Minor distribution centers and contributors (e.g. company fleet) have not been included in the target."
"We have set targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 10 percent by 2025 and 30 percent by 2030, based on a 2018 baseline (2017 for Paragominas, Alunorte and Albras due to the production embargo at Alunorte and curtailment at Albras and Paragominas). The baseline emissions equal 13.3 million tonnes CO2e and includes direct emissions and indirect emissions from electricity generation (scope 1 and scope 2 emissions). The EU has defined aluminium as a critical raw material for the green transition in Europe. See more in Hydro's Annual Report 2020, page 13 and 89."

"This is Northrop Grumman's second greenhouse gas and first absolute-reduction goal. This goal reflects consideration of science- based climate change projections, inclusive of sources such as the 3% Solution, to ensure our goal is impactful. The analysis was conducted prior to the development of CDP's standards that define a science-based goal as including a Scope 3 target and WRI's publication of the updated Scope 2 Accounting Guidance. The WWF 3% Solution calculator identified 19-24% as a the range for total percentage emissions reduction based on Northrop Grumman's base year emissions, industry classification, business unit emissions distribution/attribution and expected market share change over the goal period time horizon (2010-2020)."
"Target of 5% reduction of Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions in the Norwegian farming operations by 2025, with 2019 as base year.  The company has invested in electrical and hybrid solutions for power supply.  We received the first hybrid solution for one of our feed barges in December 2020 and expect to see reductions in emissions on this feed barge in 2021. Annual reductions due to this investment is expected to be 168 tCO2e. The company is increasing its production and had more feed barges in operation in 2020 and combined with postponed positive effects from investments of electrification to 2021, the emissions increased in 2020."
"Target of 35% reduction of Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions in the Norwegian farming operations by 2036, with 2020 as base year.  The company has invested in electrification and hybrid solutions for power supply on the feed barges in the Norwegian Farming operations, and we expect the mainstream technology for boats and feed barges will be more electrical or hybrid within 2036.  We received the first hybrid solution for one of our feed barges in December 2020 and expect to see reductions in emissions on this feed barge in 2021. Annual reductions due to this investment is expected to be 168 tCO2e per barge."
"This is NOS's first corporate GHG emissions reduction target. It was set in 2019 and, in 2020, it was formally included in the company's 2021-2025 business strategy (NOS Next Generation). Together with three other climate-related targets (for energy efficiency, renewable energy consumption and P&S that avoid client's emissions), it materializes our climate ambition and commitment. Integration of the target into the company's business goals means it is monitored regularly by the Executive Committee, alongside other strategic objectives of the company.The target covers 100% of company-wide scope 1 and 2 combined emissions, including all operations within the boundary of our GHG inventory (financial control approach). 2015 was chosen as base year because it is the first year for which we have a complete, robust and third-party verified emissions inventory. Target year is 2030 (75% reduction) but we also set the intermediate goal of achieving a 50% reduction by 2025.In 2019, we signed up to the Business Ambition for 1.5ºC initiative of the United Nations. We tested our target against the Science Based Target Initiative criteria using the SBTi ICT Sector Guidance, which used 1.5ºC trajectories, and are committed to formally adopting a Science Based Target by the end of 2021."
"This target covers a three-year period from 1 January 2018 to 31 December 2020.  This target was set by the Kazakhstan Ministry of Energy as a part of National GHG emissions quota plan of 627174 tonnes of CO2 and we believe it to be a science-based target.  In 2018 we spent 254,155 tonnes, in 2019 we spent 223,062 tonnes, in 2020 we spent 187598.   In 2019, the Company applied for an additional quota to the Ministry of Ecology for GHG emissions of the Gas Turbine Station (GTS) as the volumes were not originally included in the three-year plan, because when the 3 years plan was originally developed, the Gas Treatment Facility hadn't been commissioned. The Ministry approved the additional quota to an amount of 103,650 tones of CO2, so overall our three-year quota is 730,824 tonnes of CO2.    Over the last 3 years, 90 % of our three-year quota has been spent."
"The base year number includes emissions from our own operations.  In 2020, the Elotex business belonging to Performance Formulations was divested as of Q3 2020, the Huber CMC site Änäkoski in Finland was acquired as of Q3 2020 as well as and the inclusion of MCA Delfzijl and DME Rotterdam. Nouryon is investigating a long term directional goal of 'carbon neutral' by 2050. Our current carbon reduction target for 2025 is part of this wider carbon neutrality goal."
"We had an energy audit carried out by an external company (DELPOWER) in year 2017. This audit defined the actions to be carried out. We have already carried out actions to eliminate small energy losses. At the same time, we built new buildings and installed air heater heating. These new installations explain the little gain in terms of CO2 emissions. We have several other big plans in order to reduce our energy footprint. We are in the process of installing sufficient photovoltaic panels to cover all of our electricity consumption (35% of CO2 emissions). We also have plans to replace all of our oil burners with gas burners. This operation should reduce our CO2 emissions by 11%.35%  of MPI CO2 emissions come from electricity consumption  (total 2017 = 858 tCO2. Electricity = 303 tCO2, gasoil = 555 tCO2)"
"The Novartis target is to reduce combined Scope1 and Scope2 (market-based) GHG emissions by 100% by 2025 based on 2016 emissions. The -100% by 2025 Scope 1 + 2 targets have been confirmed to be science-based by response from the SBT initiative as part of a larger corporate target of 35% absolute emissions reductions across the entire value chain (Scopes 1, 2 and 3) by 2030. The status achieved in 2020 is a 21% reduction over previous year of emission from our industrial operations."
"Novartis received approval for Science Based Targets to achieve a 35% reduction in Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions by 2030. This is part of a larger overall environmental sustainability strategy that includes water and waste goals as well. The focus in the company is to reduce absolute emissions by 35% through efficiency and aggressive adoption of renewables, and was then modified in 2020 to achieve carbon neutrality across our value chain (Scope 1, 2 and 3) by 2030 by leveraging  absolute emissions reductions and credible, transparent offsets against own operations and supply chain where needed for unavoidable emissions.  Note: With regard to the '% of target achieved' scope 1 & 2 have decreased however scope 3 has increased compared to the baseline and 2019. When comparing with last year's and previous submissions scope 3 'purchased goods and services' altogether covered just over 2/3 of  the carbon footprint in line with the SBTi requirements, and now covers an expanded scope of our business activities. We have also started collecting supplier specific data and are exploring ways to use the data in the next reporting round."
"In 2020, Novartis increased its ambitions regarding environmental sustainability in line with our objective to be a global leader in the field and our understanding of the close interrelationship between planetary and human health.  We committed to being carbon neutral across all our operations, incl. the value chain by 2030. This follows up on our Science-Based Target adopted in 2018 and covered under Abs2. In addition to Abs2, our focus will be to drive efficiency through innovation, and substantial adoption of renewables in our value chain, particularly Tier 1 suppliers, and then to reduce our footprint to achieve carbon neutrality by leveraging credible, transparent offsets as needed."
"Novasez set an absolute GHG emission target for Scope 1+2 to maintain the global average temperature rise to 2??, much lower than the pre-industrial level, and limit the increase to 1.5??. A 10-year plan has been launched with a target of reducing emissions by 20% in 2020 (total target of 248,732 tCO2e). To achieve the final goal of 248,732 tCO2e, a total of 62,183 tCO2e must be reduced."

In 2020, CO2 emissions (scope 1 + 2) from our operations decreased by 29% to 234,000 tons from 330,000 tons in 2019. We also achieved a 46% reduction of our absolute emissions (scope 1 + 2) compared to our 2018 baseline, allowing us to achieve our 2022 target well in advance. Apart from the transition to renewable electricity and green steam at some of our sites, this reduction was also influenced by lower capacity utilization of some of our sites as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic."
"In June 2019, Novozymes launched an updated corporate strategy, along with which a  set of new  targets  (2022 mid-term targets and 2030 commitments) were put in place.  One of our commitments is to reduce by 15% our Scope-3 emissions from the Purchased Goods and Services category by 2030, compared to 2018 baseline. This has been validated by the Science- Based Targets initiative (SBTi). As part of our analysis during the target setting process, we determined that the Purchased Goods and Services category to be the biggest contributor to our Scope 3 emissions. Hence, we set a target on this category. In 2020, we began to implement our Scope 3 target to reduce our absolute CO2 emissions from Purchased Goods and Services. We are exploring multiple levers to achieve our target such as substitution to less CO2 intensive materials and engaging with our suppliers to drive emission reduction in their operations which could enable a reduction in the emissions of our raw materials. In 2020, we developed an accounting methodology for our scope 3 target, developed a roadmap for implementation and have also begun to engage with key suppliers on this."
NRG became the first power company in North America to have our goal certified by SBTi to be aligned with 1.5 degrees Celsius.   In 2020 reduced load as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic decreased emissions significantly as a result of decreased generation.  We believe the 2020 emissions level may change as load recovers from the impact of COVID-19 and NRG is continuing to target a 50% reduction by 2025.

"This target of the NTT DATA Group was approved by science-based targets initiative in June 2020 after SBT commitment in March 2019. The scope of the target is the consolidated NTT DATA Group (company-wide).The calculation logic was refined in the reporting year. Overlapping GHG emissions across categories were uniformly excluded from the base year 2016 through the reporting year 2020. Accordingly, emissions in the base year were revised from 2,289,985 metric tons CO2e to 1,997,401 metric tons CO2e. The 55% reduction target is unchanged. All revised values are guaranteed by third party verification."
Target was set in order to guarantee 0% landfill of waste generated in our operations. Emission were calculated accordingly. We have almost achieved our target by addressing for recycling/energy recovery our Matrix production in all sites and waste water being regenerated and recovered.
This target is based on waste generated at product use at our customer's operations. We have started a process of recovering spent liner (both PET and paper based) to guarantee proper recycling and avoid landifll as end of life scenario. We currently recycle about 1500t of liner with avoided emissions for 2t of CO2e per ton of spent liner.
"This target was set in 2011 for the entire TDC A/S, prior to the wide-spread adoption of the Science Based Targets initiative approach. We over achieved our 2020 target in 2019 by reducing our emissions versus the baseline by 72%. During 2019, we committed to the UN Business Ambition for 1.5C Pledge and setting SBTi targets. We have now set SBTi targets for Scope 1, 2 and 3, which have a 2020 base year and a 2030 target date."
This target is more ambitious than what is required by the SBTi initiative where we need to achieve a 56% reduction in our Scope 1 and 2 emissions to be aligned with the 1.5C pathway by 2030.

"The reduction goal represents the intent of current and future energy consumption reduction initiatives and currently does not consider available offsets or RECs. The initial goal is to reduce overall consumption without offsetting through RECs, although the use of RECs and offsets may be employed at a future date. The emissions scope includes all company electric and natural gas usage; employed for facility operations and process energy in our manufacturing facilities and administrative buildings. The emissions scope additionally includes all emissions from our company owned transportation/delivery fleet and our operations/admin ground fleet. Excluded from the scope are fugitive emissions and emissions from our privately owned wood burning boilers. Boiler emissions are excluded from scope 1 emissions because they utilize bio-based wood waste as fuel. If sales continue to increase as projected we can reasonably expect that emissions will also increase over time so it is expected that we will need to employ renewable or low-carbon energy sources by 2030 to be able to reach this absolute energy reduction target.During 2016 we met our intensity target of 25% emissions reduction. We used a baseline of 2009 and had a goal of reaching this by 2019. This required us to set a new intensity goal this year and we have decided to use the 2016 emissions calculations as our new baseline. We also decided to set a new absolute target. 2020 total emissions were 47,313.985 MTCO2e. This is a 7.8% decrease from total emissions in 2016. In 2020 an error in reporting natural gas usage was noticed for our Plant 11 facility. This error was corrected and the correction is reflected in the this year's report within our baseline GHG emissions."
"At the end of 2018, the Company set CO2 emission reduction expectations for OG&E.  Our actions to date reinforce our commitment to reducing our environmental footprint. our CO2 emissions have decreased by over 40% below 2005 levels. The Company has not officially aligned with the Science-Based Targets Initiative at this time, however based upon the Company's current reductions versus 2005 baseline and the expected reductions in carbon of 50% by 2030, the Company believes it is in alignment with the goals put forth by the Paris Climate Agreement and the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) goals of limiting global temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius through 2030.  Referencing the attachment under C12.4, the chart superimposes the relative magnitude of OGE future emissions expectations onto a set of IPCC pathways limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees C.  Note that OGE emissions through at least 2030 have superior performance to or fall within the range of IPCC pathways."

"OG&E is electrifying its transportation and service vehicle fleets and expanding its electric vehicle (""EV"") charging infrastructure.  The Company plans to incrementally replace its light-duty vehicle fleet until 100 percent are EVs.  In September 2020, OG&E announced it would reduce greenhouse gas emissions from vehicle fleets an estimated 60% by 2030.  To achieve the goal, we will replace 50 percent of our light-duty vehicles with electric vehicles (EVs) by 2025 and 100 percent by 2030.  We also plan to purchase more fuel-efficient medium- and heavy-duty trucks and, where possible, reduce engine idling emissions by using Electric Power Take Off (ePTO) systems.  ePTO systems power aerial buckets, cranes, hoists, augurs, and other large vehicle-mounted equipment with electricity instead of a diesel fueled engine.  These actions will reduce GHG emissions by reducing the consumption of energy from non-renewable sources such as gasoline and diesel fuel.   Only the light duty fleet emission reductions are characterized in the response."
"In order to estimate the achievement of Scope 1 target, it was necessary to recalculate our 2014 baseline. To do so, we incorporated emissions from Rede Conecta (a network service provider), considered as scope 3 in 2014 , in scope1. In 2016 Conecta was incorporated to the Oi group and since then we have been reporting higher scope 1 emissions. With our baseline corrected it is possible to evidence that the implementation of efficiency methods mainly in the company's fleet and other measures that reduced the need for home care for customers contributed to a 17% reduction in Scope 1 emissions when compared to 2014."
"In 2020, Oi's scope 2 emissions reduced 32% compared to our 2016 baseline. When we analyze the last two years of energy consumed, we had a decreased consumption of 8,10% in energy, and 24,68% in emissions.Following the Brazilian GHG Protocol Program for accounting corporate GHG emission inventories, in 2020 we were able to use the market-based methodology to estimate scope 2 emissions and we managed to track the consumption of 1.68% of the total energy consumed from renewable sources. For the next two years, we intend to increase this share representing the reality and all the effort made so far to the transformation of our energy matrix."
"Our 5% reduction goal was set with the understanding that we could earn significant scope 2 savings with changes in sourcing and capital improvements to our handling facilities. We have started to learn about aligning this with science based targets and expect to refine this goal in the coming year. We are revising our goals based on more realistic business time frames, and with the expectation of bringing a revised Scope 1&2 survey on-line."
"As one of the co-chairs of the WBCSD CSA working group we have identified a need for introducing science based targets (SBTs). In 2016, Olam signed up to the Science-Based Targets Initiative which seeks to increase the number of companies reducing their Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions. This is to ensure alignment to a 2-degree Celsius global warming scenario, and companies should pursue efforts to limit the increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius. At the beginning of 2018 we submitted these targets to the Initiative, which were approved in July 2019. As part of Olam's Science based targets, we committed to reduce our absolute scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions 50% by 2030 and 100% by 2050. This requires a reduction of 3.85% per year. By 2050, we aspire to be carbon positive in operations, requiring a 5% emissions reduction per year from 2031 – 2050. We are also developing stretch targets for our supply chain. Currently, due to the incompatibility of the Science-based targets measurement approach in regards to the agriculture sector, the total scope 1 and 2 emissions targets are not being achieved. Whilst total scope 1 and 2 emissions have increased due to business growth, Olam has continuously improved its carbon sequestration from its farms and plantations. In 2020, Olam sequestered 751,382 tonnes of CO2e. This represents a 39% increase since 2017, and a 34% increase from its 2018 level. These measures are, however, currently not included in the science-based target measurement approach."
"Oleon and its shareholder the Avril Group are working together with the French consultancy Carbone 4. Carbone 4 will support companies of the Avril Group to adopt a major committment on climate change. The climate strategy project was launched in May 2020 and consists of a 3-step approach:1: Carbon footprint assessment on scope 1, 2 and 3.2: Definition of emission pathways that limit global warming to well below 2°C above pre-inudstrial levels. Adoption of emmissions reduction targets.3: Definition of emmissions reduction levers.The result of the carbon footprint assessment is the creation of a new long term energy reduction target. The Avril Group (including Oleon) will strive for a 30% reduction of CO2 emissions by 2030 (base year 2019) and a 30% reduction of CO2 emission intensity per ton of product (base year 2019). The Avril Group is planning to join the SBTi end 2021, beginning 2022."
"We have set a carbon-neutral target of reducing CO2 emissions from Olympus Group sites to virtually zero by 2030, as well as a target of gradually switching all electricity* consumed at our sites to renewable energy sources by 2030. This target was approved by the Board of Directors and announced in May 2021."
The reduction  of scope 1 emissions can be attributed to the installation of  catalysts at the Nitrous Oxide abatement facilities.

"Phasing out routine flaring and venting is one of the essential steps toward combining resource efficiency with long-term economic success and a way to strongly support our efforts to reduce the carbon footprint of our operations. In 2020, OMV routinely flared and vented 473.6 mn m3. In 2017, to reinforce our clear commitment to responsible resource management and sustainable business, we also endorsed the World Bank's ''Zero routine flaring by 2030” initiative to end the routine flaring of associated gas during oil production by 2030. We report annually to the World Bank on our progress in adherence to this initiative. New OMV oil and gas fields are developed and operated according to plans that incorporate sustainable utilization or conservation of the field's associated gas without routine flaring. Existing sites where routine flaring of associated and free gas still takes place are required to develop a phase-out plan to eliminate legacy routine flaring as soon as possible, but no later than 2030. Many activities and projects to stop or reduce routine flaring have already been implemented or are ongoing, such as the Energy Efficiency Program in OMV Petrom Upstream."

"Through its actions, Orano intends to contribute to the fight against global warming and the preservation of resources and health, major challenges of the century. Developing access to competitive and low-carbon electricity for all in a world fighting against global warming The IPCC scenarios confirm it: to contain global warming to 1.5° C and continue to evolve in a sustainable world, nuclear power is not the only solution, but it is essential. The Paris Agreement on the fight against climate change provides for a sharp reduction in CO2 emissions and the European Union has set itself a target of carbon neutrality by 2050. Orano intends to contribute to this collective mobilization.  In addition to being convinced of the role that nuclear power can play in the energy transition towards low-carbon electricity, Orano has been involved in a program to reduce its own emissions since 2004 in order to contribute to the collective effort. The group made a commitment to reduce its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 50% between 2004 and 2020. Based on these results, Orano wants to go further in its contribution to carbon neutrality with a new target to reduce its direct and indirect GHG emissions (scopes 1 and 2) by 15% by 2025 compared to 2019 (thus 2,5% reduction per year, aligned to the French National Low Carbon Strategy - SNBC for French Strategie Nationale Bas Carbone, which is aligned on the below 2° Paris Agreement)."
Our SBT carbon target covers 100% of Orbia's global emission based on operational control. We have announced 47% reduction of our Scope 1 + 2 by 2030. This is a Science Based Target aligned with the 1.5°C scenario; submission to the SBTi committee still pending.

"In FY2020, our total operational Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions were 2.1 MtCO2-e. This represents a 9.5 per cent (222 ktCO2-e) reduction from FY2019, achieved by replacement and improved performance of selective catalyst abatement in our nitric acid plants.Our targets are underpinned by a credible and achievable pathway to decarbonisation focused on the reduction of Scope 1 and 2 emissions across our global operations. This includes a continued focus on industrial process emissions, energy efficiency and heat recovery, and renewable energy. With natural gas feedstock a significant component of our emissions profile and cost base, we are assessing how renewable hydrogen could play a role in our decarbonisation journey over the longer term.Our absolute target was informed by the SBTi Absolute Contraction Approach, in the absence of a sector-specific methodology for the chemical sector. Orica contributed feedback to the SBT technical working group developing the chemical sector methodology and will revisit its target setting approach once this methodology becomes available."

Our target was approved in December 2017. Our FY2017 base year data has been restated to incorporate emissions from Australia Pacific LNG's Train 2 which was not fully operational when the baseline was initially set.
"Our target was approved in December 2017.  Following an audit review and updated calculation methodology, our FY2017 base year datawas restated to 27,451 kt CO2-e in FY2019. This approved Scope 3 target covers all supply chain emissions incurred within the domestic market (Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) and Corporate Scope 3 emissions are excluded as their emissions are not material). It includes the electricity and gas our Energy Markets business sells to customers, and the gas Australia Pacific LNG sells to domestic customers. It does not include Australia Pacific LNG volumes, which meets SBTi's minimum two-thirds coverage requirement for Scope 3 targets.Our FY2020 Scope 3 emissions were 20,910 kt CO2-e, a decline of 12% on FY2019. The decrease in Scope 3 emissions is primarily due to an increase in contracted renewable generation and solar feed-in purchases, as well as lower electricity purchases from the NEM. Sales volumes decreased partly due to COVID-19 and increased retail solar uptake and efficiency. The increased penetration of renewables resulted in a lower emissions intensity for the NEM, further reducing our Scope 3 emissions."

"In December 2019, Oriola set ambitious strategic goal to become carbon neutral by 2030. This target includes scopes 1 and 2 and relevant categories from scope 3. Achieving carbon neutrality means that we must reduce our operations' CO2 emissions to zero. The primary tool in reducing our carbon footprint is to make changes in our operations and supply chain by switching to renewable energy sources, for example. Carbon offset is a secondary means for us, to be used when it is not possible to further reduce our emission levels.Base year for carbon neutrality was set to 2019. Base year emissions were reviewed in 2020 and as a result the total emissions increased from 6.645 to 6.908 metric tons CO2. Increased emissions are due to internal data validation review and changed calculation method of some emission sources. Oriola has evaluated possibility to set science-based targets (SBT) and is anticipating setting one in the next 2 years.  However, we have compared the reduction in emissions of our carbon neutrality target to science-based target and it is already now in line with the 1,5 degrees of the Paris Agreement Goal."
"We are committed to continuously improve our performance and have done so over the past several years by developing data quality, reporting and governance on climate-related matters and by systematically reducing our carbon dioxide emissions and engaging in energy conservation through an Energy Efficiency Programme. Orion is committed to the extension period of the joint Energy Efficiency Programme for the members of the Confederation of Finnish Industries (EK) and this is progressing well. In 2018, we set a target to cut our scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions according to IPCC recommendations. This means reductions of 75% by the year 2025, using 2016 as the reference year."
The Science-based target was developed based on IPCC AR5 RCP2.6. The target is going to be achieved through phasing out fossil fuels for stationary combustion (burning oil and heavy fuel oil) as well as purchase of guarantees of origin for the total electricity consumption in Orkla Group.

"Yes, OR  considers its targets to be science based. OR is using the GHG protocol accounting for scopes 1, 2 and 3 emissions within a logical timeframe and in line with the 1.5 target of the Paris Agreement.  The earth is now 1.1°C warmer than it was at the start of the industrial revolution. We are not on track to meet agreed targets in the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change, which stipulated keeping global temperature increase well below 2 °C or at 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels. To avoid the worst of warming (maximum 1.5°C rise), the world will need to decrease fossil fuel production by roughly 6 per cent per year between 2020 and 2030. Countries are instead planning and projecting an average annual increase of 2 per cent. OR's goal is even more ambitious than this with it's target to achieve an 83% carbon footprint reduction by 2030, and to additionally achieve carbon neutrality by 2030 applying offsetting methods.This target covers all of OR's climate bookkeeping which includes geothermal power plant emissions as well as car fleet emissions within scope 1. Within scope 2 is energy usage, however, since OR already produces all of the energy that it consumes, these emissions are already accounted for in scope 1. Within scope 3, OR considers emissions from waste, employee commuting, excavation work by contractors, and employee flights."

"Austrian Post reported the same target to CDP in 2020 as it reports against this year. Various actions lead to emission reductions until 2017. Since 2018, we have recognized a rise in emissions for the first time since 2011. CO2 emissions (Scope 1–3) rose by 13 % to 86,949 tonnes compared to the previous year. Carbon emissions for the Österreichische Post AG property and buildings area (Scope 1 and Scope 2) increased by 5 % to 13316 tonnes. The rise in carbon emissions (Scope 1 and Scope 3) for the vehicle fleet is 15 % (to 73,633 tonnes).Both figures were driven by the strong growth in parcel volumes (+30 %) brought about by Austrian Post's partnership with Deutsche Post DHL Group and significant organic growth, which in turn was spurred by lockdowns imposed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This partnership and the increase in volumes made it necessary for Austrian Post to increase the capacity of its logistics centres, as well as its transport and vehicle capacities. On the whole, the discontinuation of DHL's own delivery network effects an increase in efficiency in delivery throughout Austria and thus an improvement in the energy and environmental balance.Austrian Post is currently working on a revision of the current SBT with 2020 as a new base year (first year of full data with DHL Group integration), in order to consider the new market trends in the scenario analysis. Furthermore, Austrian Post aims at calculating a SBT which applies to the 1.5 C scenario rather than the current goal, which applies to 2.0 C scenario."
"By joining the EV100 programme, Austrian Post aims the deployment of 100 %e-powered vehicles for all delivery operations (last mile) by 2030 and thus aims to reduce its Scope 1 emissions from delivery to 0% in 2030 compared to the base year of 2018. This target is aligning with the SBT."
"Absolute targets of Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. and Taiho Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. have been approved by SBTi. For an impact on the Group, 30 companies out of 51, which is 60% of the entire number, are subject to an approval."
"Owens Corning used the Absolute Emissions Contraction Method from the Science Based Target Initiative to set aggressive 2030 GHG emissions goals.  Our approved targets are a commitment to reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions 50% by 2030 from a 2018 base year and to reduce absolute Scope 3 GHG emissions 30% within the same timeframe.  The Scope 1 &2 target was determined by the Science Based Target Initiative to be in line with 1.5°C trajectory, and the Scope 3 target was determined to be in line with the Well-Below 2°C trajectory.During 2020, SCS Global Services' Greenhouse Gas Verification program conducted a verification of Owens Corning's end-of-year 2020 emissions against the requirements of the Carbon Disclosure Project and the WRI/WBCSD GHG Protocol. The Verification Statement documents that SCS Global Services has conducted verification activities in compliance with ISO 14064-3:2006 Specification with guidance for the validation and verification of greenhouse gas assertions. The statement also attests that SCS Global Services performed a Type 2 Assurance Engagement to evaluate Owens Corning against the AA1000 Principles (2018) to a moderate level. For Scope 1 and 2, and Scope 3 categories 1, 3, 6, 7 and 12, greenhouse gas emissions and energy use from 1 January 2020 to 31 December 2020, a high level of assurance was conducted.  SCS's review of the management systems, governance documents, data collection methods, and KPI calculations have found no material errors. Owens Corning's reporting of 2020 Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions, water use, waste, air pollution, VOCs, social performance indicators, and 2020 progress towards 2020 and 2030 sustainability goals were assured at a moderate-level and no material errors or misstatements were identified in the final draft chapters of the report. Owens Corning's 2020 reported Scope 1, 2, and scope 3 categories 1, 3, 6, 7 and 12 GHG emissions, energy use, employee engagement (% responding and % actively engaged), and types and amounts of philanthropic contributions was assured at a high-level and this data can be considered reliable. In addition, Owens Corning's Report was found to conform with GRI Standards."

We have planned to lower our energy consumption which directly affects our GHG emission. Our objective is that through the implementation of new technology we can lower electrical usage in the Dominican Republic facilities.
"GHG emissions are directly influenced by energy consumption, therefore Oxygen Development has opted to focus on active projects aimed at reducing electrical usage. Targets represent absolute figures. Absolute figures were selected to consistently demonstrate reduction of energy consumption as relative figures (intensity targets) would not represent our actual reduction because Oxygen Development manufactures a wide variety of products ranging from products requiring very little energy to produce to products requiring much higher levels of energy to produce."
"PACCAR achieved approval of science based targets (SBT) for Scopes 1, 2 and 3 in 2021. The Scope 1 and 2 SBT is a 35% absolute reduction of CO2 emissions from PACCAR's global facilities between a baseline year of 2018 and a target year of 2030 and is based on SBTi's ''other industry SDA (sectoral decarbonisation approach)” using the absolute contraction method for well below 2°C."
"PMI has established a set of ambitious, science-aligned environmental targets using the science-based target methodology and influenced by the ambitions of key customers. Our emissions reduction target is to reduce absolute scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions by 50% by 2030 from a 2018 base year. This applies to all of PMI's operations. In addition, we have committed that factories representing at least 85% of PMI spend will have environmental improvement plans in place by 2022."
The emissions reported above cover all of our subsidiaries and have been calculated in accordance with GHG Protocol Corporate Reporting Standard. We aim to increase our reporting to cover industry appropriate scope 3 in future years. We have made a commitment to become carbon net-zero by 2026.
"At the Group level, PALFINGER defined the long-term target of reducing production-related CO2 emissions by 25 percent by 2030 versus 2015 back in late 2017. In this context, the share of renewable electricity is also to be increased to 75 percent group-wide by 2022.Both targets are a major step in the right direction. The switch to electricity from renewable sources for all German sites and one site in Brazil  increased the share of green electricity to 73.5 percent group-wide (2019: 68.3 percent).As a result, absolute emissions were also reduced in the reporting period by about 16 % to 30,796 metric tons of CO2 equivalents (2019: 36,588 metric tons).At PALFINGER, decisions on the implementation of climate protection measures are made at plant level. Emissions were recorded in the group-wide monitoring system using a notional CO2 price of EUR 30 per metric ton of CO2 equivalents. PALFINGER is thus preparing for a future taxation of CO2, which is already increasingly on the political agenda in some countries.Implementation of a comprehensive integrated climate strategy aligned with science based targets initiative, which also correspondingly takes into account emissions from the upstream and downstream value chain, was started in 2019 and due to corona was rescheduled for end 2021."

"Pandora commits to becoming carbon neutral by 2025 across Scope 1 and 2. We plan to do this by purchasing no more than 5% carbon offsets. Therefore, it will be absolute reductions resulting from Pandora switching its operations to renewable energy. The targets is consistent with reductions required to keep warming to 1.5°C."
"In 2019, Pandox has reviewed its environmental target with the purpose to update the goals to be in line with the new materiality analysis. The goal has been set to reduce CO2 emissions by around 20% by the end of 2023 according to Pandox's green investment programme. The programme includes 12 of Pandox's 20 properties in Operator Activities. The reason for selecting 12 hotels in Operator Activities is because Pandox controls the operation of these hotels, which facilitates the implementation and also ensures that direct savings will benefit Pandox."

"La meta se fijó únicamente para una disminución del consumo de luz, como un objetivo independiente. Sin embargo, se aprecia un aumento en la emisión de contaminantes (tCO2e) de forma global (4.6% mayor que en 2019); en este reporte se incluyen factores que no habían sido considerados en la meta inicial; es decir, factores como consumo de diésel (energético de proceso), consumo de diésel para la distribución de PT y consumo de gasolina para autos utilitarios. Por lo anterior, el objetivo de reducción no se cumplió; ya que tuvo un ligero aumento del 3.7%. El valor de emisión de CO2 fue mayor para el año 2020 aumentando 4.6% con respecto al año anterior."
"The amount of Scope-1 emissions is exclusively related to fleet vehicles and combustion in boilers. The increase of emissions for the reporting year with respect to base year is essentially due to the acquisition of a new factory, whose emissions are reported for the first time. This does not compromise the achievement of the target, since the absolute value of the first two plants decreased and actions have been planned to reduce also the emissions of the third plant. Moreover, Pattern is evaluating the substitution of all its fleet vehicles with electric ones, aiming at reducing Scope1 emissions to zero."
"Scope-2 emissions are exclusively due to the electricity purchased. Given that the absolute value of the first two sites has decreased, the increase of emissions for the reporting year with respect to base year is only due to the acquisition of a new factory. To meet the target some interventions have been made and others have been planned: at the end of 2020, a photovoltaic system designed for self-consumption became operational for the Collegno plant and we are evaluating to implement the same system in the Correggio plant and to extend to all our factories the purchase of 100% certificated green energy in 2021."
"Scope-3 emissions, related to employee commuting, increased in the reporting year due to the growth in the number of employees connected to the acquisition of a new company. In order to reduce scope-3 emissions, in 2019 Pattern signed an agreement with the municipality of Collegno to start a car-pooling project, which was postponed to September 2021, due to the restrictions related to the Covid pandemic."
"In base year 2015, 234'286 kWh of gas for heating purposes was consumed, which corresponds to a CO2 emission of 50'762 kg. In 2020,  approx. 65'000 kWh  of gas was consumed , which corresponds to a CO2 emission of 12'025 kg."
In the course of the renewal of the company truck an efficient EURO-6 Norm truck was purchased. This truck emits less pollutants such as nitrogen oxide. But it also consumes less fuel. So the average consumption was reduced from 20l/100km to 17l/100km. Over 65'000 driven kilometres this represents a fuel reduction of about 15%.
"Our Target is based upon reducing C02 Emissions per 1,000,000 consumer units manufactured. This is is difficult as it relies on inbound customer orders and growth production volume as well as enegery savings initiatives."
"We are committed to addressing our emissions and supporting climate action to meet the Paris Climate Agreement. We set a Science-Based Target to reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions 25% by 2025 from a 2019 base year. We also commit to reducing the absolute scope 3 GHG emissions from fuel and energy-related activities 25% over the same timeframe, as shared below. Our absolute emissions targets are company-wide, consistent with reductions required to keep global warming to 1.5°C and approved by the Science-Based Targets initiative. Our 2020 total GHG emissions fell compared to 2019 primarily driven by the substantial growth of our data center renewable energy procurement, which reached 98% in 2020, and the significant reduction of our business travel and office emissions due to COVID-19 pandemic."

"PepsiCo announced in 2016 our goal to reduce our absolute emissions across our entire value chain by 20% by 2030 (against a 2015 baseline). This goal was approved by the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) and was aligned to a 2C pathway. In April 2020, we signed the Business Ambition for 1.5C pledge committing to raise our ambition towards a long-term net zero goal. In late 2020 the SBTi approved our new 1.5C aligned goal which we subsequently announced in early 2021. Our new goal more than doubles our previous one within the same timeframe. Our new goal is to reduce our Scope 1 & 2 emissions by 75% and our Scope 3 emissions by 40% by 2030 against a 2015 baseline. We also have a goal to achieve net zero emissions by 2040, a decade earlier than called for in the Paris Agreement."

"Last year, the Group submitted a greenhouse gas emission reduction target to the Science-Based Targets (SBT) initiative. In June 2019, the SBT initiative approved our targets, which are aligned with a below 2°C scenario for our Scope 1 and 2 emissions. It covers all production sites for scope 1 and 2.From FY18 to FY20, reduction (-4,15%) in absolute terms is observed due to a decrease in both scope 1 and 2. The direct emissions (Scope1) declined in line with the decrease in production volumes. The indirect emissions (Scope 2) declined due to a decrease in electricity consumption and an increase in renewable electricity sourcing."
"As of 2020, we have exceeded our 15%  reduction goal for GHG Emissions (currently at 23% reduction).    *Please note:  due to many acquisitions, divestitures and associated data complications, 2015 baseline has been restated.  The 2015 data gathered covered 100% of global operations at the time.  Any divestitures are removed the year divested, and acquisitions are included after their first fiscal year, with one exception:   The operations of Omega Pharma, an EU based acquisition made after starting the strategy, was decided to be excluded until 2020.  While the 15% goal is a company goal and still applies to them,  it is tracked locally.  PLEASE NOTE:  The energy/emissions data from these newly integrated sites (Omega Pharma and Ranir) is NOT included in the reported data above, since they are not factored into the baseline.  However it will be included in our new baseline for our 2026 goals."
This was our last year reporting on our targets set from the 2015 base year.  This is a new target with a goal of reducing our GHG by 15% by the year 2026.  Note that our baseline for this target is likely higher than the target from ABS 1 above because this base goal is set from a broader scope that includes acquired sites that had not been measured within our baseline for the previous goal.  The scope of the figures represented here includes all Perrigo facilities globally that are either owned by Perrigo or that are leased in which direct manufacturing occurs.  Note that this  baseline will be restated next year pending divestitures.
Science-based target developed with the support of the Carbon Trust utilising Science-Based Target Initiative guidance. This target has been submitted for approval to the Science-Based Target Initiative.  This covers all operational activity using GHG Protocol Corporate Standard guidelines.
"Our GHG inventory is based on ISO 14064, wherein we quantify our direct and indirect emissions. We set a standard 10% Y-o-Y reduction target on total carbon footprint of the company. This reporting year we have achieved more than our target of 10%. The % emission reduction from FY19-20 to FY20-21 was 41.12%. This multifold decrease in emissions is majorly due to reduced operational days owing to COVID-19 pandemic."
"We could have achieved 100% of the target, but because the company can only reach 84.9% for some policy reasons."
"This year we revised our low-carbon commitments, adding an operational emissions reduction target for 2030. This was the sixth consecutive year of reduction of our operational emissions since 2014, with reduction in greenhouse gas emission by 5% compared to 2019, consolidating the decline profile over the past few years.Our goal of reducing absolute operational emissions encompasses 100% of the assets operated in all of our businesses, including energy generation for all greenhouse gases."
The base target was set with consideration of few emission reduction initiative at PLI manufacturing plants.
"By 2030 become net zero carbon operationally (scope 1 and 2).The target is company wide medium term target applying to all Group operations including retail , grooming operations and veterinary operations. It is based on an in depth emissions assessment from the 19/20 financial year and the target was launched in the 20/21 financial year. We are signatories and committed to the Science Based Targets Initiative to a business ambition of 1.5 in March 2021, with the intent of going through the formal SBTi evaluation."

"Pfizer exceeded our third generation (2012 – 2020) public goal, reducing Scope 1+2 emissions by 33% over the goal period (vs 20% targeted). Approximately 5% of this reduction is attributed to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our global Commercial and Fleet operations in 2020.  In December 2020, Pfizer announced ambitious fourth-generation GHG emissions reduction targets, subsequently approved by the Science Based Targets Initiative as aligned with a 1.5C trajectory, and has joined the Business Ambition for 1.5C. Pfizer commits to be carbon neutral across our internal operations (Scope 1 + 2 market-based) by 2030, delivering a 46% absolute reduction in direct emissions from a 2019 baseline, and purchasing 100% renewable electricity."
"Pfizer previously established an aspirational goal of reducing our GHG footprint 60-80% by 2050 from a 2000 base year.  To achieve this, we set shorter-term targets and have now achieved three consecutive GHG emission reduction goals (2000-2007, 2007-2012, and 2012-2020). At the end of 2020, Pfizer had reduced GHG emissions by 64% from the 2000 baseline.  We have raised the level of our ambition in setting  our fourth-generation GHG emissions reduction targets, committing to be carbon neutral across our internal operations by 2030, delivering a 46% absolute reduction in direct emissions from a 2019 baseline, and purchasing 100% renewable electricity. Recognizing that indirect emissions account for approximately 80% of our carbon footprint, we aim to use our influence to catalyze similar reductions across our value chain. We are implementing a multipronged approach, including embedding environmental sustainability criteria in our vendor selection processes, strengthening expectations within contracts and engaging with key suppliers of goods and services to drive the adoption of science-based GHG emission reduction goals. We also commit to reduce emissions related to business travel by 25% and upstream logistics 10% by 2025 from a 2019 baseline.  Our new targets have been approved by the Science Based Targets Initiative as aligned with a 1.5C trajectory."
"In 2020, PG&E continued to track progress towards the company's five-year greenhouse gas emission reduction goal for its operations (including natural gas transmission and distribution, vehicle fleet, and PG&E facilities). PG&E's voluntary goal entails a 10% reduction from a 2016 baseline by 2022. As part of this goal, PG&E launched a Million Ton Challenge, a five-year strategy to avoid one million metric tons of cumulative greenhouse gas emissions from 2018-2022."
"The Cap and Trade target years include 2020 and 2030. California's 2030 target is consistent with IPCC recommendations. California's 2017 GHG inventory (the most recent data publicly available) showed that emissions are 7 MMTCO2e below the 2020 GHG Limit of 431 MMTCO2e.PG&E's target is to comply with Assembly Bill 32 (AB 32), Assembly Bill 398 (AB 398), and Senate Bill 32 (SB 32) and we are committed to helping the state meet its long-term greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction targets.  AB 32 mandates the reduction of California's GHG emissions to the 1990 level (431 million metric tons of CO2e, as determined by ARB) by 2020. Under AB 32, PG&E and other ""covered entities"" that emit significant amounts of GHG emissions in California are included in a Cap-and-Trade (C&T) program for GHG emissions. The regulation became effective on January 1, 2012, and the program began implementation on January 1, 2013. The C&T program is one of many measures being implemented under AB 32 to meet the 2020 GHG emission reduction goal.Approximately 73% of PG&E's Scope 1 voluntarily reported GHG emissions were covered by the C&T program in 2020. PG&E has a compliance obligation under the C&T program, as determined by the Air Resources Board, for emissions from: our electric generation units that exceed the inclusion threshold; imported electricity; natural gas compressor stations; and natural gas delivered to customers that are not separately covered by the C&T program. AB 398, passed in 2017, extended the C&T program out to 2030. SB 32, passed in 2016, requires the state to achieve a 40% reduction in greenhouse gases by 2030 compared to 1990 levels. PG&E is prohibited from disclosing any non-public information concerning allowance auction participation, which could include expected emissions trends."
"This target covers scope 1 and 2 emissions from owned and operated buildings, factories and fleet. In 2016 we submitted this target and it was approved by the Science Based Target initiative (SBTi) in 2017.In 2020, we achieved 55% reduction versus our 2010 baseline exceeding by 15% the target set (i.e., 40% reduction by 2030) and thus resulting in 137% achieved (55%/40%*100=137%). This achievement has been possible thanks to increased energy efficiency in our factories, on-site renewable investments, sourcing power from renewable resources and a program to reduce emissions in our vehicles fleet. Since the beginning of the pandemic, the priority has been to ensure the safety of our employees and their families. The company immediately activated the remote work policyand tools across our operations. With our people staying at home, energy consumption consequently dropped in the offices that stayed completely closed and increased in the facilities that stayed operational, with reduced capacity, due to the intensive operation of the ventilation systems; in total, our emissions from the offices dropped in 2020 by 31 percent versus 2019. In 2020, emissions from our fleet saw a great decline as well, of around 26 percent versus 2019, as an impact of the home office but also as a result of the lockdown measures implemented all over the globe and the lower number of kilometers driven by our employees, as well as our efficiency efforts.We consider the Covid-19 related reductions to be a temporary event, driven by an extraordinary emergency, the great majority of our carbon emission reductions has been achieved by dedicated projects in energy efficiency and switches to renewable energy between 2010-2020. This is what we consider to be a permanent result that we will continue to strive through implementation of our carbon reduction strategy."
"This target covers scope 1 and 2 emissions from owned and operated buildings, factories and fleet. In 2016 we submitted this target and it was approved by the Science Based Target initiative (SBTi) in 2017.In 2020, we achieved a 55% reduction versus our 2010 baseline and thus 91% achieved (55%/60%*100=91%). This achievement has been possible thanks to increased energy efficiency in our factories, on-site renewable investments, sourcing power from renewable resources and a program to reduce emissions in our vehicles fleet."
"This target covers scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions from all operations and our entire value chain. In 2016 we submitted the target that was approved by the Science Based Target initiative in 2017 (SBTi).In 2020, we achieved a 50% reduction versus our 2010 baseline and thus 126% achieved (50%/40%*100=126%). This achievement has been possible thanks to progress in reducing our environmental impact across our value chain: in our factories and fleet where our carbon footprint is relatively small compared to other industries, as well as beyond the factory gates. This achievement also includes looking at both our upstream supply chain activities (currently focusing on tobacco farming and direct materials) and downstream, following our product and packaging environmental impacts to end-of- use. In the overall reduction we are listing, the impact generated by the extraordinary conditions due to the Covid-19 pandemic that we consider temporary and not a part of our reduction strategy for which we are still investing according to the original and pre-pandemic plan."

"At Phoenix Group we have committed to achieving net-zero across all emission scopes by 2050. As a financial institution we have yet to fully appreciate the full carbon impact of our investments and wider supply chain and as we gather data, model calculations and design targets over the next two years the size of our carbon footprint will grow substantially as the scope of the emissions we can accurately measure increases. After this, we expect our actions will show a significant reduction as we move towards 2030, and then on towards 2050. In 2020 our scope 3 emissions scope increased to now include a calculation for working from home emissions - this represents approximately 18.57% of our overall 2020 emissions (4,129 tonnes) and accounts for the 3.3% increase in total emissions in 2020.  We consider this to be in line with our targets as it still shows a substantial like for like emission reduction (if the increased scope was excluded) of 15.87%."
"We have begun the work of identifying the best approach for our Net Zero by 2050 target by setting our first milestone to bring our operations (scope 1, 2 and scope 3 business travel from our operational properties excluding direct investment properties) to net-zero carbon by 2025. We have created a strategy that includes internal milestones such as capital investment for energy efficiency and behaviour change campaigns that will help reduce energy consumption and subsequent emissions within our operational properties. In 2020 we have also added a number of operational properties with the inclusion of RE-assure to our overall Phoenix group of companies.  This target represents the percentage (72.32%) of  scope 1 and 2 emissions and Scope 3 business travel associated within our operations and, as such, does not include the  portion of Scope 1 and 2 emissions associated with our direct investment properties not linked to company operation.  This portion of our emissions is currently covered within our 2050 target (Abs 1)."
"The calculation methodology is adopted in accordance with SBTi guidelines. Annual monitoring is carried out (since 2015). The data are aggregated by production units (Cherepovets Complex, Balakovo, Volkhov and Kirov branches)."
The target refers to the combined emissions of Pontedera and Baramati which together amount to more than 70%. The target is ambitious but achievable thanks to the important initiatives underway such as the change of fuel in the painting plant in Baramati or the decommissioning of the diathermic oil plant and the cataphoresis in the 3/4 plant in Pontedera and the replacement of the '2W cataphoresis system. The activities scheduled for Pontedera ended in 2020 (delays due to COVID) and will take effect in the final balance of 2021.

The exceeding of the target is due to the very strong drop in production due to the COVID of the Indian plant.
"It has been very challenging to achieve absolute emission reductions. There have been some significant improvements in energy efficiency, installation of new refrigeration systems and rollout of solar installations. It is expected that these improvements will lead to greater carbon reductions in the future. Over the past reporting year, Pick n Pay has reduced our Scope 1 and 2 emissions. We anticipate setting a new Absolute Reduction target within the next financial year."

"Target:  100% of verified emissions offset for FY20. Pinnacle believe the first step to managing climate risk is to understand our emissions sources and verify the integrity of those sources. By attaining third party verification of our emissions, Pinnacle can better manage our carbon risk exposure and identify areas for improvement. Pinnacle's FY20 carbon inventory was prepared with the assistance of Pangolin Associates and validated by an external third-party. Pinnacle will remain Climate Active Certified for FY21 emissions and will continue to have its carbon inventory assessed for accuracy each year. FY21 emissions are currently being externally assessed after which those emissions too will be 100% offset."
"In January 2020, the Company set the boldest clean-energy goal of all Arizona electric companies, as well as one of the most ambitious in the country, to reach 100 percent clean, carbon-free electricity by 2050. This goal includes a nearer-term 2030 target of 65 percent clean energy, with 45 percent of our generation portfolio coming from renewable energy. We also will cease reliance on coal-fired generation by 2031. The commitment is informed by consultations with Arizona universities and non-governmental organization experts. Their input is grounded in current, globally recognized climate science and provides a greater understanding of the impacts of our changing climate across the state. Our 2050 target is consistent with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's recommended timeframe for limiting global warming this century to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. We will continue to monitor climate science developments to stay aligned with new research and recommendations.The target year of 2032 takes into account our first two milestones of our Clean Energy Commitment, 65% clean by 2030 and ceasing reliance on coal- fired generation. Our Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) includes an Action Plan that lays out the near-term actions we must take to progress rapidly to our 2030 interim target and ultimate 2050 goal. APS developed three portfolios for the 2020 IRP that meet both our reliability and clean energy needs over the Planning Period. This target aligns with Path 2 - Shift, which build on our bridge plan but also moves APS away from natural gas more quickly be excluding any new natural gas generation."

"Piraeus total GHG emissions target: We aimed to reduce our total GHG emissions by 10% (period 2014-2020). In 2018, the aforementioned five-year target has been revised because it had already been achieved. Target was already met due to the significant reduction in electricity consumption through energy-saving implemented programs (also refer to c4.3b) and the change in the energy mix in the Greek electricity sector. Since 2014, the grid emission factor has been reduced by approx. 24% (2016 publicly available data). In 2020, total scope 1, 2 & 3 was calculated without including in the calculations  mortgage loans and equity investments cat 15 and employee commuting cat 7 for Scope 3 emissions . This was made in order to achieve numeric correlation with the number that was calculated in base year 2014 which due to the old calculation methodology did not include mortgage loans and investments cat. 15 and employee commuting cat. 7.Since 2019 Piraeus Bank is calculating both mortgages and investments in its Scope 3 calculations.Revised absolute five-year target: 30% reduction of PB's total (Scope 1 + Scope 2 (location-based) + Scope 3) GHG emissions – base year 2014. Following its participation in the Collective Commitment to Climate Action, in July 2020 Piraeus committed to the Science Based Targets initiative. Piraeus has set a science-based target for its Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions. The method for assessing financial institutions' scope 3 impacts against a well-below 2°C emissions trajectory is the PCAF methodology . The main categories of indirect emissions (Scope 3) which are of particular interest to the PB were assessed, with a view to providing a concise aThe Bank's Scope 3 emissions have been set in a way that helps towards the assRelevant Scope 3 emissions categories that are part of PB's Scope 3 emissions inventory are: category 1. Purchased goods and services (e.g. fixed equipment, courier services, security services, etc.)category 4. Upstream transportation and distribution (e.g. furniture, electrical and electronic equipment, archive, etc.)category 5. Waste generated in operations (including management/transport)category 6.

"The Company-wide target to reduce of 25% the company's absolute Scope 1+2 emissions by 2025, compared to 2015 values, has been approved on June 2020 by the Science Based Targets initiative, which judged it to be consistent with the actions needed to keep global warming ''well below 2°C”, as recommended by the Paris Agreement.This target has been publicly communicated, together with the Commitment of Pirelli to the SBTi, within the Pirelli Industrial Plan."
"The target to reduce of 8,6% the company's absolute Scope 3  emissions from purchased goods and services by 2025, compared to 2018 values, has been approved on June 2020 by the Science Based Targets initiative.This target has been publicly communicated, together with the Commitment of Pirelli to the SBTi, within the Pirelli Industrial Plan."
"For previous reporting years, location-based & market-based Scope 2 emissions were the same. In previous reporting on progress to target, location-based Scope 2 emissions were used. However, Pitney Bowes has been increasingly investing in renewable energy as well as renewable energy credits (RECs) as a strategy to reduce emissions. Therefore, moving forward progress will be measured using market-based Scope 2 emissions.  When calculating progress towards target, Scope 1 & 2 emissions associated with Newgistics sites are not included as the acquisition occurred in 2017 and thereby not included in the 2015 base year. Newgistics sites represent 7.8% of overall emissions so only 92.2% of emissions are represented in progress towards goal."
"PJSC Gazprom's environmental management system sets for 2017-2019 a goal to reduce the actual values of methane emissions against the planned ones (Fact/Plan*100%) during the repairs of the GTS. Then, the result is evaluated against the baseline of 2014. The 2014 baseline for this value is 62.7%.All natural gas transmission subsidiaries of PJSC Gazprom are within the scope of this target. The progress is evaluated annually. In 2019 the goal was achieved and completed. New targets have been adopted for 2020.New Gazprom's Environmental Goals for 2020-2022 (approved 2019), are in effect in 2020. 2018 was adopted as the baseline. One of the new indicators is the Reduction of GHG emissions during natural gas transmission per commodity transport activities against the baseline.  This indicator is presented as Int 3 in C4.1b."

"The target includes the reduction of Scope 1 emissions from LUKOIL Group enterprises located in Russia. Foreign enterprises are not counted.Emissions from Russian enterprises in the base year 2016 account for 84.1% of the total emissions of Scope 1.In 2020 Scope 1 emissions for Russian entities of the LUKOIL Group decreased by 8.8%, with a target of 1.2% versus the level of 2016. 2020 is the target year. Thus, our goal of reducing GHG emissions has been achieved.The target to reduce emissions by 1.2% is the first voluntary climate commitment of the LUKOIL Group, determined on the basis of the technical capabilities of the Company in the absence of the best Russian industry practice and legal basis.It should be noted that in 2019 the boundaries of the inventory for Russian organizations were expanded both in terms of the number of enterprises and the amount of greenhouse gases accounted for using international calculation methods (GHG Protocol, IPCC 20016).Correspondingly, emissions adjustments for the base year have been made. This was done as part of improving the corporate system for accounting and management of GHG emissions.The updated emissions for the base year as well as for the reporting year 2020 were verified by an independent auditor.In connection with the end of the first target period in 2020, LUKOIL Group has set new long-term targets for the period up to 2030."

The improvment between 2019 and 2020 can be explained by the implementation of our energy consumption reduction action plan and the COVID-19 crisis (production shut down for several months).
The improvement between 2019 and 2020 can be mainly explained by the reduction of vehicles sold in 2020 due to sanitary crisis.
Nominal target of 5% improvement
"Original base year emissions were reported to be 451,970 metric tons CO2e. In March 2012, PNC acquired RBC Bank USA, the U.S. subsidiary of the Royal Bank of Canada, which increased the company's baseline by 6.3 percent. We have readjusted the baseline to reflect the 28,236 metric tons of CO2e associated with the acquisition. To ensure transformation actions are in line with science and our tradition of innovation and responsibility, the team set ambitious scope one and two emissions reduction targets of 75 percent by 2035 using a 2009 baseline based on absolute methodology of science-based targets as a means of verification. We have reduced our carbon emissions by 65% from a 2009 baseline.We anticipate setting a science-based target in the next 2 years assuming the methodology is established in this sector by this time."
"In our strategy we have defined science-based emission reduction target of 80% till 2030 and climate neutrality not later than 2050. Emissions are calculated based on (i) use of fossil fuels in PGE activity (ii) installed capacity of generators on fossil fuels (iii) 75 bln PLN investments in energy transition.Reduction will be an effect of the investments carried out – including development of RES and shift from coal to natural gas in district heating, while also taked into account the process of carving-out of coal power plants as envisaged by the government."

"Our absolute GHG emission target to reduce gross GHG emissions generated by our producing operations by 35% by 2030 (2019 baseline, covering Scopes 1 and 2) applies to mines operating in 2019, namely Kyzyl, Varvara, Voro, Mayskoye, Omolon, Dukat, Svetloye, Albazino, Amursk POX-1 and 2, and Nezhda. It does not cover future development projects and potential new assets. As stated, we will apply this target only in combination with our intensity target, which more accurately conveys our progress and it therefore our main reporting metric.A phased transition from diesel generators to low-carbon grid electricity (including RE), engaging with power grid owners and developing our own renewable energy sources alongside efficiency enhancements, will help us meet our absolute target. Upstream and downstream GHG emissions (Scope 3) are not included in current targets. However, as part of our efforts to achieve carbon neutrality, we have requested that key consumables suppliers provide carbon data so that we can further widen Scope 3 reporting across the most material supply chain categories. We are also engaging with contractors and will set a Scope 3 target by the end of 2022."
"With the resolution of the EU on the climate targets (CO2 neutrality by 2050), we have set ourselves a first interim target of reducing our CO2 emissions in Scope 1 and 2 by 20% by 2025. This is a first step in a long process. When the goal was formulated, we deliberately only decided to take the first step, as we did not yet have any specific customer requirements. Since we now have the first customer requirements, we have a better orientation as to which additional demands are made of us. We can now better integrate these into our own target planning."
"The company has realized a reduction in emissions due more efficient operations in road transport and an investment in a solar plant to replace electricity purchased from the grid. Efficiency in Fuel use The organization put a drivers incentive system on fuel consumption targets in kilometers covered per litre of diesel. The targets were categorized using the engine consumption capacity of the vehicles. Drivers who had efficient [performance in fuel consumption in kilometers covered per litre of fuel  were recognized a nd given incentives. This lead to an improvement in the quantities of fuel consumed in the last twelve months.Load and route planning optimizationIn the last twelve months Ponty Pridd Holding Limited  optimized on fuel consumption through working with the customers in vehicle capacity load optimization and route planning . This initiative also lead to reduced fuel consumption and reduced scope 1 carbon emission.The Fuel consumption for the reporting year reduced to 3329277.59 Litres and  Scope 1 Carbon Emission  reduced to 8441,13 Tones ."
In 2018 we took ISO14001 Certificate and so this is the first year in which we have analysed emission data. The annual Environmental Report contains all the consumption data and the relevant calculation methods.
"Starting from 1 April 2020, Ponzini purchases only and exclusively energy from renewable sources (A2A), so we have eliminated the emission of CO2 in atmosphere. So, for 2020 we have calculated the CO2 emissions for the period January-March. But, from 1 April, CO2 emissions in atmosphere have to be considered zero.  In 2021 we will reach the goal of zero all the year."
"The base year is the average from 2017 to 2019, and it is entered as 2018 because only a single year can be entered.  Also, since POSCO took over off-gas power generation in 2019, it was necessary to recalculate it using the same standard to calculate the base year's emissions. Therefore, the acquired off-gas power generation was regarded as an internal facility from 2017 to 2019, and the annual emissions were calculated and set based on the three-year average value. The figures cited above are the values calculated by ourselves at the end of 2020 to establish our 2050 carbon-neutral vision. In 2021, the government notified the recalculated emissions for 2017-2019 and POSCO disclosed them in the 'POSCO 2020 Corporate Citizenship Report (p.104)', which is different from the previously set base year emissions."

"This absolute target refers to the reduction of the Group's total direct GHG emissions (Scope 1) and total indirect GHG emissions (Scope 2 and 3) by 30% by 2025. Both real estate and logistics activities are considered.Targets adopted by companies to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are considered ''science-based” because they are in line with the level of decarbonization required to keep global temperature increase below 2 degrees Celsius compared to pre-industrial temperatures, as described in the Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC )."
Absolute scope 1 and 2 emissions were similar to 2019. The volume growth at Parcels and our logistic networks resulted in an increase in the number of kilometres we drove and related emissions by 6 kilotonnes. This was offset by a decrease in CO2 from our buildings as we started to renewable source our natural gas in 2020.
"For subcontracted transport, our scope 3 emissions relate to networks within Parcels,  logistics and international. Strong growth across these networks had impacted scope 3 emissions. In total our scope 3 emissions increased by 6% compared to 2019. Compared to our base year these emissions were 6% lower."
"This target relates to the Scope 1 and 2 emissions of Power Corporation, covering our GHG emissions from electricity and natural gas at our head office properties. The reduction achieved to date was mainly driven by emission reduction activities related to LED lighting and building equipment upgrades. Please note that the reduction since 2011 is 60%, which divided by our reduction target of 8% yields a 750% achieved reduction."
"This target (2013-2025) applies to Scope 1 and 2 emissions for Lifeco's owner-occupied and investment properties in Canada.

"PPL's 2050 goal was publicly announced in January 2018 and covers Scope 1 and Scope 2 CO2e emissions. In February 2020, PPL increased its carbon reduction goal and adopted a more aggressive timeline for achievement of the original goal – 80% reduction by 2050 and a 70% reduction by 2040. Through our efforts to economically transition our generation fleet, responsibly expand our unregulated renewable generation and reduce emissions elsewhere in our operations, we are on track to reduce our goal-related emissions by nearly 70% by 2035 and 80% by 2040. Regarding calculation of Scope 2 emissions, LG&E and KU's emissions are calculated using a hybrid of location based and market-based factors. LG&E and KU have access to location-based factors for power procured from specific contracted units. LG&E and KU also purchase a small amount of power in the wholesale market.

"To reduce its emissions, Precinct Properties New Zealand Limited is developing a GHG Emissions Management and Reduction Plan with the intention of setting a science-based carbon emissions target and pathway based on the Climate Bonds Initiative. The Climate Bonds Standard and Certification Scheme is a labelling scheme for bonds and loans. Rigorous scientific criteria ensure that bonds and loans with Certification, are consistent with the 2 degrees Celsius warming limit in the Paris Agreement. The Scheme is used globally by bond issuers, governments, investors and the financial markets to prioritise investments which genuinely contribute to addressing climate change.  The Climate Bonds Initiative provides a guide on the emissions efficiency of assets for the purpose of a Green Bond. Management have formulated a 10-year reduction target to hit a weighted average per square metre emissions factor that aligns with the CBI target for 2030.Precinct's targets are based on the Absolute approach and incorporates all the businesses carbon emissions including scope 1, scope 2 and scope 3 emissions.  The base year was set as 2017 with a total of 4306 tCO2e emissions.  Since 2017, the business has reduced its emissions to 3913, a reduction in around 9%.  Importantly, the scope 1 and 2 emissions have actually reduced by around  22% with the difference relating to scope 3 emissions increasing since the base year due to an improvement in data collection and accuracy."

Annual target set against previous year
"Since 2019, we have set a 5-year target of 7% reduction of CO2e emission in Scope 1&2 from 2019 to 2024."
"When this goal was set, there was no established science-based target methodology for the financial institution sector, our absolute target follows the science-based targets methodology for the U.S. corporate sector: to reduce 2010 greenhouse gases by 30% by the end of 2020. To be on track to keep the rise of global temperatures below 2°C, the US corporate sector must reduce total annual greenhouse gas emissions in 2020 by 1.2 gigatons of CO2e from 2010 levels. This amount is equivalent to a 30% reduction of 2010 emissions by the end of 2020 across the US corporate sector (or annual reductions of approximately 3 percent per year). This is known as the 3% Solution. In 2015, Principal set a target to follow science-based GHG reduction target methodology in alignment with the 3% Solution. Our goal is to reduce our 2010 (baseline) Scope 1 and Scope 2 (location-based) emissions by 30 percent by the end of 2020. As of year-end 2020, we achieved a 47 percent reduction in our 2010 (baseline) Scope 1 and Scope 2 (location-based) emissions. Therefore, we have achieved and exceed our long-term emissions reduction goal."
"We have exceeded our 2020 goal of reducing our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 30%, as compared to 2010 baseline, with a total GHG reduction of 47%. We utilized the well-below 2 degree C (WB2C) model within the Science Based Target tool to set our next carbon reduction goal for our scope 1 and scope 2 market-based emissions. Our new goal is to reduce our baseline Scope 1 and Scope 2 (market-based) emissions by 40 percent by the end of 2035.  Because the low building occupancy in 2020 reduced our carbon emissions, we decided to use 2019 emissions as our baseline for this new goal."
"In addition to working toward a 40% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions over the next 15 years, we also aspire to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. This target is an outcome of our Net-Zero target (NZ1). We estimated our US scope1+2 emissions to represent 80% of our company-wide scope1+2 emissions,  therefore, we estimated the base year emissions to be 30,680/80%=38,350. We are in the process of collecting actual data on our non-US locations."
"The data reflects what was reported in 2020 Sustainability report which reflects fiscal year ended June 30, 2020.   P&G now purchases 100% renewable electricity in the U.S., Canada and Europe. These three markets represent more than 70% of our purchased electricity globally.   This enabled us to exceed our goal."

We have reduced our scope 1 and 2 emissions by 228% since the 2015 baseline. This is ahead of schedule. however we acknowledge that the Covid-19 pandemic has likely had a significant impact on our carbon footprint and is a key contributor to these reductions. We will continue to monitor our carbonfootprint this year and reduce it in the future. But we are anticipating to set our target to net-zero in the next 2 years .

"As a financial services company, the technical guidance to accurately understand our indirect footprint was only recently released. We set a target where our data is most robust: that of our domestic operations. The SBT methodologies considered include CDP criteria, which utilizes the RCP 2.6 scenario, as well as SBTi criteria utilizing 2DS, SDA, and C-Fact methodologies. Prudential evaluated both medium- and long-term time horizons to evaluate the range of possible criteria for setting our goals in the absence of specific SBTi guidance for financial institutions. Our target reflects an annual 1.97% linear reduction from our base year. We will continue to explore opportunities to expand the scope of our target and align with updated climate science."
"Given the change in the Group perimeter in June 2018, the  ''Sustainability Scorecard” has been updated in 2019 in order to include all General Cable plants. For this reason, the baseline year was fixed to 2019, which is the first complete year referred to the new perimeter. In the Sustainability Scorecard a goal concerning Greenhouse Gas emissions (GHG) reduction has been set for year 2022. The scope of the emissions, for which the target is defined, is a combination of Scope 1 and Scope 2 (location – based). Please be aware that the baseline value does not include the estimates for 2 plants in India and Oman, for which actual data are not available.   The Group total emissions in the base year were equal to 918898 tCO2 (including those plants): for this reason the target coverage is 97% (this estimate is considered to be largely conservative, as, after further investigation, it can be assumed that excluded sites account for 1%, making the coverage percentage about 99%). The target reported and achieved represents a short – term target for the Group. However, in 2020, the Group began work on the development of science-based objectives for the emissions generated by its activities worldwide (Scope 1 and 2) and for the emissions of the broader value chain (Scope 3).

Greenhouse gas emission target of the PTT Group in 2030 was revised from the previous 20% reduction target to 27% reduction target, compared to the business-as-usual scenario. (2030 PTT Business as usual emission is expected to be 62.3 MtCO2e, PTT has set GHG target to control GHG emission below 50 MtCO2e).In 2020, PTT emitted scope 1+2 GHG emission around 30.2 MtCO2e, which is lower 2019 PTT GHG BAU emission and target emission. For science-based target setting, one of PTT Flagship company, GC, has committed to set its target in accordance to   science-based target since 2016. GC established the long-term strategy on climate change using Science Based Target to mitigate GHG intensity target reduction of 52% by 2050 from the base year of 2012."
"In early 2013, PTTEP has established GHG intensity reduction target by 25% in 2030 compared with 2012 base year. This target covering 100% all operating assets under PTTEP operational control.  The absolute target was set and calculated based on the intensity target."
"This reduction target is extrapolated from the calculation of our emission in base year 2012 for the Group. We strive to achieve 10% of the GHG reduction from our emissions by 2022. For the target of greenhouse gas emissions reduction of scope 1+2 (market) was equivalent to a reduction of around 869,598 ton CO2e. In 2020, 7,880,000 ton CO2e of GHG emission for scope 1+2 emitted, which represents an accumulative reduction from 2012 of 616,758 ton CO2e or 72.6% of total GHG reduction target. We have succeeded in reducing and met target in the reporting year 100%."

We have succeeded in reducing and have met reduction target 100% for the reporting year."
"In 2009, PSEG set a goal of reducing its Scope 1 + 2 emissions by 25% by 2025.  PSEG met its initial goal of a 25% reduction 14 years ahead of schedule in 2011.   In 2019, PSEG introduced a significant extension of the ''Powering Progress” vision, setting a goal of reducing its Scope 1 emissions by 80% by 2046.In June 2021, we revised our emissions reduction goal with the intent of reaching net zero with respect to Scope 1 and 2 emissions for our operations by 2030.  In August 2021, PSEG announced that it had entered into an agreement to sell its fossil generation fleet, marking the first significant step towards our 2030 goal.  To handle the remainder of our emissions in less than 10 years, PSEG will leverage a suite of strategies – from modernizing its existing natural gas and electric T&D networks to investing in new technologies that support greater electrification and improve energy efficiency. PSE&G's successful Gas System Modernization Program, which replaces old cast-iron and unprotected steel gas mains, helps to achieve the methane goal of a 21.7% reduction of absolute methane emissions from 2018 to the end of 2023 and would allow a significant reduction in methane emissions by 2030. PSEG's strategy to address emissions also includes evaluating alternatives to natural gas. These strategies target reducing methane and other emissions, such as SF6, that contribute to global warming and climate change, often more than carbon emissions.  In PSEG buildings and facilities, the company will look to achieve savings through energy efficiency solutions. For its vehicles, PSEG has committed to electrify a large portion of its fleet over a ten-year period. For any residual emissions, PSEG will explore high-quality carbon offsets."
We achieved our target for 2020.  Please note this is a like-for-like emission target.
"Our 2017-2018 fleet Co2 emissions was estimated to be 160 metric tons. By retiring older fleet, replacing and reducing total number of new fleet and improving car pooling to job sites we reduced our Co2 by 36 metric tons. At our 2017 ""Management Review"" we set a 2018 Quality Objective to reduce our Co2 emissions for our fleet by 12 metric tons per year. In 2018 we reduced them by 10 tons and in our current year we reduced them by  another 24 tons( 22.5%)."
"One of the Sustainability Program objectives for 2020 and set in 2014 the reduction of 100% of scope 2 GHG emissions.

Puig has successfully achieved this objective. In another step further towards the use of renewable energies, in 2020, we carried out an important solar energy pilot project at the Alcalá plant which involved the installation of photovoltaic panels for the production and self-consumption of electricity. The facility became operational in December 2020. In 2021 we plan to finish defining the new 2030 Agenda and its associated actions, among which the fight against climate change and the reduction of carbon footprint will continue to be priorities for Puig."
"In 2020 Puig undertook a new commitment: adherence to the global Science Based Targets (SBT) initiative, which helps companies set science-based targets aligned with the Paris Agreement's goal of limiting the global temperature increase to 1.5 °C. Through this commitment, expanding the scope of our carbon footprint calculation and defining a specific science-based reduction target will be a priority for Puig from 2021. The final Scope1+2 target was validated in July 2021 and is the following: Puig S.L. commits to reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions 50% by 2030 from a 2019 base year."
"PUMA has an approved Science-Based Target (well-below 2 degree) for market-based Scope 1 and 2 emissions. The target covers owned and operated PUMA office, stores and warehouses as well as our car fleet.  According to the approved SBT, we are targeting a reduction of 35% by 2030 from a baseline of 2017.  Our baseline value for Scope 1 and 2 emissions combined is 47,707 tCO2e. Taking into account our move to renewable energy contracts and our purchase of RECs certificates for 100 % coverage of all owned and operated PUMA office, stores and warehouses in 2020, our market-based 2020 Scope 1 and 2 emissions are 5,257 tCO2e. Thus, we managed to lower our combined Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 71% compared to 2019 and by 89% compared to 2017. Taking these RECs into account, we already have hit our science-based emissions target of 35% for Scope 1 and 2 emissions. We also have achieved the absolute 45% reduction required to align our target with a 1.5-degree scenario.For further details, please refer also to the PUMA Annual Report 2020, pages 47 to 52."
"Puratos has a target to reach 100% renewable electricity use by 2023. This will be achieved through a combination of onsite production of renewable electricity and the purchasing of certificates such as GO, REC and I-REC. We already buy such certificates to compensate for the electricity use in Belgium and Spain (REGO = 70,000 MWh), the USA (REC Green-e certified = 18,000 MWh) and China, Brazil, Russia and Mexico (I-REC = 20,188 MWh) equaling 100% of the electricity used by our facilities in these countries. At Group level, this represents 66% of the total electricity use. We also have our own projects for renewable electricity production on-site. In 2020, solar panels provided over 23% of the electricity needs of the production facility in Portugal, over 9% in Chile and over 26% in China. Solar panels have also been installed in Malaysia (September 2020) and India (October 2020) and they have been providing respectively 12% and 7% of the production facilities electricity needs since their installation. There is also a project underway to build 2 wind turbines on 2 Belgian sites (Lummen & Belcolade) in collaboration with Electrabel. These 2 wind turbines have a potential saving of 2,300 tCO2e emissions. This represents 50% of the electricity consumption on both sites.To make sure the absolute non-renewable carbon emissions do not increase anymore before we reach our goal of 100% renewable electricity sourcing in 2023, we have developed a phasing-in plan that increases the renewable electricity sourced by 10% each year. We started with 50% in 2018, we are at 66% in 2020 (reporting year) and aim to be at 100% in 2023, according to this plan."
Achieve a 25% reduction in absolute GHG emissions by the end of 2030.
"As a signatory of the UN Fashion Industry Charter for Climate Action, launched at the 2018 UN Climate Change conference (COP 24), PVH commits to reduce absolute scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions by 30% by 2030 from a 2017 base year. PVH also commits to sourcing 100% renewable electricity by 2030, which translates to an absolute emissions reduction for scope 1 and 2 of 71% by 2030 from a 2017 base year. This target was initially approved by the Science Based Targets initiative in September of 2019. Subsequently, PVH revised its baseline information for scope 3 emissions, and our target was re-validated by the Science Based Targets initiative in July of 2020.In 2020, PVH reduced its scope 1 and 2 emissions by 47% against the fiscal year 2017 baseline and by 22% from fiscal year 2019.These emissions reductions are due mainly to increased renewable energy REC purchases in North America and Europe, and the implementation of our 18 Megawatt peak solar project in Venlo, the Netherlands. COVID-19 related facility closures during lockdown periods did result in a decrease of purchased energy consumption, though the decrease was not directly related to the length of time each facility was closed. This was due to facilities still running HVAC systems and lighting timeclocks per the original schedule, resulting in energy consumption in empty and closed facilities."

"In 2015, Tommy Hilfiger Global determined this absolute reduction target, which covers its scope 1 & 2 (location-based) and logistics and business travel emissions. In 2015 the Tommy Hilfiger emissions from purchased electricity (Scope 2) were calculated using country average emissions per kWh (location-based). In 2020, the approach was updated to Market-Based in order to take into account the green electricity that has been purchased by our facilities. In 2020 several updates were planned for the baseline including the market-based approach, the addition of the emissions of new acquired regions to account for inorganic growth, and updates in methodology that leverages more of the available data. As a result of the COVID-19 impact on the business and limitations in capacity, the latter update has not been implemented. The 2020 footprint decreased by 46% relative to the baseline and as a results of emissions reduction activities through the Tommy Hilfiger Climate Cool Program and the COVID-19 impact in global sales."

"Since we are the third year to reply CDP questionnaires from 2018, we have less  experience in collecting  emissions but we tried to collect company wide emissions from 2018  so we can have more data to compare between 2019 and 2020.  Will learn how to set up a science-based target in near future. Hope to sumbit SBTi candidate in Q1 2021."
"QCW replies CDP questionnaires completed version  from 2019  that we're a stranger to learn  Science Based Targets initiative, SBTi about reducing Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions per million USD output value. We need to learn how to make progress on this matter then move step by step. From 2020 we learned to collect emissions data from Scope 1 and Scope 3, the more data we collected , the more data we can make a plan how to reduce in future. Hope to submit SBTi candidate in Q1 2021."
QBE has established an informal science-based target for our Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions using the tools developed by the Science-based Targets Initiative. This target was calculated in line with the most ambitious decarbonisation scenario (1.5oC scenario) targeting a 30% absolute in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 2025 (from a 2018 baseline).  In 2020 QBE achieved this target with an overall reduction of 80% in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions.
"Our target is to reduce business air travel emissions by 20% by 2021 from a 2017 baseline. In 2019, we are achieved our air travel target and in 2020, we maintained this reduction with an 85% reduction in air travel emissions."
"In FY21 (CY2020), we set an absolute 5% reduction goal for Scope 1 and Scope 2, using FY20 (CY2019) as baseline."
"Aware of the challenges of climate change, Quadient is committed to reducing its carbon footprint. The Company has set targets in line with the well below 2°C"" trajectory to limit average global warming to 2°C, as set out by the Paris Agreement in 2015. Quadient has launched a low-carbon strategy to reduce the emissions related to its hardware and digital solutions and tackle its emissions related to its energy consumption.By implementing this strategy, Quadient aims to achieve a 28% reduction of its emissions related to energy consumption and company vehicles and 40% per m€ revenue of emissions related to Scope 3 targeted categories between 2018 and 2030, compared to a business-as planned scenario.In 2020, there was a sharp decrease in our Scope 1 and 2 emissions due to exceptional COVID-19 environment, following a notable reduction in 2019."
"Our GHG goal represents a company-wide absolute target related to both Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions: Our goal is a 30 percent reduction in absolute Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions from our global operations, compared to a 2014 baseline, by 2025. With the completion of our acquisition of the remaining interest in RF360 Holdings Singapore Pte. Ltd. (''RF360”), we reviewed and revised our GHG reduction goal baseline. This re-baselining was conducted with a third-party to ensure that our GHG inventory adheres to The Climate Registry General Reporting Protocol. Our GHG reduction goal baseline year remains 2014, but now includes RF360 Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. The result of the recalculation is an increase of approximately 130,000 metrics tons of CO2e to our baseline."
"QTS has a goal to procure 100% of its energy from renewable (Scope 2 carbon free) sources by 2025.  We have a small amount Scope 1 of emissions from testing diesel generators, and eventually we believe we can shift these units to biodiesel, but the goal has not yet been formalized.   Irving was 100% renewable in 2018.  In 2019 we added Chicago and Piscataway to the 100% renewable club.  2020 we added Fort Worth, Hillsboro, Richmond, and both of our Netherland's sites.  This target is far more aggressive than the 2 degree pathway guidance.  While progress appears slow, keep in mind that this is an absolute target and the measure of a data center's growth is by how much power it uses.  Without increased power usage, the company would not be growing.  So as the non-renewable sites grow, the denominator in our equation makes the % achievement appear low.  So while overall electricity consumption grew by 10%, emissions dropped by 5.2%."
"QTS develops, owns and operated massive data centers around the world.  The typical process for any data center company when developing these massive, expensive, critical operation facilities is to start from zero, and build everything new.  And QTS does this with many of our development projects.  But four of them - Atlanta, Dallas, Chicago, and Richmond, VA were massive structures that were originally built for something else.  Atlanta was a huge Sears and Roebuck distribution center.  Dallas and Richmond were old semiconductor plants, and Chicago was the Chicago sun times printing facility.  As the times changed, these structures were no longer useful for their intended purpose.  Most data center companies would choose to scrape that building off the ground and start fresh.  But QTS took the step of refreshing these structures and turning them into some of the most advanced and energy efficient buildings in the world.   So far we have saved 628,000 MWH of electricity in those four markets from not having to reproduce the steel and concrete. And we have saved 538,000 gallons of diesel fuel from being burned from hauling that material to the landfill.  By 2050 these facilities will be 100% full and we will have saved all of the steel and concrete that would have had to be reproduced."
"(1)In 2015, Quanta completed greenhouse gas emissioncertification, thus 2015 is designated as our base year. However, the ISO 14064-1:2018 revision was implemented in 2020, hence the GHG audit base year was changed to 2020.(2)Quanta established a company-wide inventory list of greenhouse gas emissions in accordance with the requirements of ISO 14064-1:2018 and the greenhouse gas level disclosure protocol. Each year, the Company will conduct the greenhouse gas emission inventory check and acquire the verification certification. In response to government policies, new energy conservation measures and goals are stipulated each year. A comprehensive greenhouse gas emission statistics calculation system is also being gradually established. The inspection covers the qualitative and quantitative check of category 1 (direct greenhouse gas emissions), category 2 (indirect greenhouse gas emissions). The calculated emissions do not include tradeoffs and transactions.GHG audit was not carried out at the Thailand plant, hence it was not included in the GHG emissions data."

This one of the most ambitious fleet electrification targets of any company in Canada, given the size and diversity of its subsidiaries' fleets. Not only will the vehicles no longer be using gasoline powered motors, but the vehicles will also be recharged on hydro-electricity, a renewable and low-emitting greenhouse gas energy source."

"Scope 1 emissions were 850MT CO2e in 2017, and 826MT CO2e in 2020 (3% redux). Scope 2 emissions were 886MT CO2e in 2017, and 575MT CO2e in 2020 (35% redux). This reduction comes from the installation of a large solar panel array on our HQ rooftop that was activated in May 2020. Note that we also purchased 850MT CO2e offsets to comply with our commitment to RE100, although that isn't reflected in the emissions being reported under this question."

"Target is to reduce Scope 1+2 emissions consumption by 35 percent for RBI with base year emissions in 2011 of 81,089 t (due to a change in data availability in the network banks TBSK, RBHU, RBAL, RBBG, RBKO and AVAL, the values were recalculated for the base year 2011 & the previous year 2019 and cannot be compared with previous year CDP data). CO2e. Aim is to reach 52708 t CO2e in 2025. This target is underway and nearly 35 percent of Scope 1+2 emissions have been reduced (2020: 52,648 t CO2e). Measures to be implemented comprise awareness by employees to turn off lights and shut down the computers, new energy and building technology (like LED lamps and less energy consuming computers), travel reductions etc. in all locations in all network banks.HOWEVER: COVID-19 meant that 2020 was an extraordinary year. With more people working from home, consumption at the office locations decreased significantly. Consumption levels, and hence the CO2 reductions, are expected to increase next year. Therefore we expect an increase of the emissions in 2021 and our goal has actually not been achieved by now.This target was also reported in the previous year's CDP questionnaire.We consider this as science based target since we assumed a 2.5 percent reduction from year to year (as SBT developed a framework and guidance for the financial sector by end of 2020 we have 2 years to approve targets. Currently we are in a phase of developing appropriate targets and plan to have them approved by 2022)."

"In FY20, we established a science-based target to reduce our absolute GHG emissions by 30 percent by 2030, compared to 2020 levels. This target includes reducing emissions from our operations (Scope 1 and 2) by sourcing 100 percent renewable electricity and reducing emissions from our supply chain (scope 3). Our goal was approved by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), indicating that our ambitions align with reduction pathways to limit global temperature rise across the planet to 1.5°C.The goal is consistent with our commitment as a signatory to the UN Fashion Industry Charter for Climate Action to achieve a 30 percent aggregate GHG emission reductions in scope 1, 2, and 3 of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Standard by 2030, against a baseline of no earlier than 2015. The goal is also consistent with our membership in RE100. Setting a value chain carbon reduction target is a significant milestone for Ralph Lauren. We believe that companies must establish ambitious, science-based targets to ensure that society averts the disruptive effects of climate change. Our commitment represents our long-standing values, reflects the evolution of our thinking and will help decarbonize the fashion industry. We are in the process of implementing a detailed plan to achieve our goal by sourcing renewable energy for our operations and reducing the carbon intensity of raw materials, manufacturing, and production in our supply chain.Ralph Lauren's annual carbon footprints are aligned with our fiscal years. The baseline year of our science-based target is aligned with FY20, which ran from April 2019 to March 2020. However, the target language of the SBTi specifies 2030 as the target year. Due to our reporting cycle being misaligned with the reporting year, we're aiming to achieve our 2030 goal in our FY31 reporting, which will cover April 2030 to March 2031."

"The 2020 goal covers scopes 1, 2, and scope 3 business travel.  Both legacy companies had 2020 GHG reduction goals spanning the timeframe between 2015 - 2020. This goal combines the 2 company goals into 1 Raytheon Technologies goal.  There are small differences in methodologies and scopes between the 2 legacy goals.  The Raytheon Technologies rebaselined 2020 goal was a 12% reduction in GHGs from 2015 levels. The company exceeded this goal and cut GHG emissions by 18% by the end of 2020."
"This is a company wide GHG goal and covers scopes 1, 2, and scope 3 business travel (commercial air and employee car rentals).  The 2025 goal period is between 2021 - 2025, and the company's first reporting year against this new goal will be 2021.  The baseline year for the goal would normally be the year prior, 2020, but it was decided not to use that year as the baseline due to the severe impacts of COVID on emissions.   Therefore, we selected calendar year 2019 as the baseline year.  The company's GHG emissions in 2020 are much lower than normal due to the significant, world-wide effects of the COVID pandemic on the economy and to the aviation industry.  2020 emissions are not a representative number.   The 2019 baseline will be used as Raytheon Technologies' goal baseline throughout the 2025 goal period."

"Through its internal carbon network, Bonduelle is working on developing science-based targets for its GHG emissions by 2022."
"This is our 2030 target to reduce our absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 65% by 2030 versus 2015. Our absolute target aims to continue the success of our previous Reckitt 2020 GHG targets, within the context of SBTi and absolute, long term reductions beyond 2020. This target also includes our Nutrition business, formed from the Reckitt's acquisition of Mead Johnson Nutrition in 2017 therefore it is now company-wide. We have established a 2015 baseline for our new absolute target, as pre-2015 data for our new business units is not available or is not relevant due to business changes. Reckitt's absolute greenhouse gas emissions for scope 1 and 2 (market-based) in 2020 were 261,814. This represents a 38.4% reduction in absolute terms since 2015. This means that we have are 59% towards achieving our 2030 target [425,008-261,814 = 163,194CO2et; - 163,194 /425,008*100 = -38.4%; % of target achieved: 38.4%/65%=59%]. These greenhouse gas emissions are reported based on a market-based approach. Status: Target on track - greenhouse gas emission reductions are on track to be achieved, based on future plan and progress to date."
"This is our 2030 target to reduce our absolute Scope 3 GHG emissions by 50% by 2030 versus 2015. This target also includes our Nutrition business, formed from the Reckitt's acquisition of Mead Johnson Nutrition in 2017 therefore it is company-wide.We have set an ambitious 2040 carbon neutrality target, to reduce our absolute Scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions by 100% by 2040 versus 2015. Our absolute target was established in 2020 and aims to continue the success of our previous Reckitt 2020 GHG targets."
"Regarding electricity, demonstrating the constant commitment to the environment and to reducing atmospheric emissions, it is noted that the Group has increased the purchase of renewable electricity from Guarantee Origin Certificates, reaching a quota of approximately 50% of total electricity purchased by the Group in 2020 (approximately 85% considering only the electricity purchased by European plants).It is the Group's objective to reach 100% renewable electricity purchased for Recordati's European manufacturing and packaging sites and annexed offices by the end of 2021"

Recticel contributes to this aim by optimizing its carbon footprint throughout the value chain, alongside its partners.We focus on introducing raw materials with lower GWP (global warming potential) values as well as lower-carbon impact raw materials, improving the energy efficiency of our activities, and developing more sustainable products and end-of-life solutions that support a circular economy.We estimate that, in 2020, the CO2 emissions avoided by our insulation solutions offset over 46  times our carbon impact throughout the value chain, making the growth of this business a priority. To optimize our carbon footprint, we want to reduce our negative impact and increase our positive impact in a significant way. In line with these goals, we focus on areas in our value chain where the biggest progress in carbon footprint reduction can be made: upstream (raw materials) and downstream (usage and end-of-life phases). UpstreamTogether with our suppliers, we explore innovative solutions and investigate more sustainable raw materials such as a CO2 polyol. Polyols and isocyanates are fossil fuel-derived raw materials used to make polyurethane. The production of these chemicals is energy-intensive. Thus, our suppliers strive to optimize energy efficiency and find alternatives to fossil fuels. Covestro developed a revolutionary new polyol that replaces 20% in weight with a by-product of the CO2 captured from a nearby facility.

"In 2018, the SBTi approved RE's targets in accordance to the SBTi criteria, ambition level 2DS. In order to achieve our SBTs, RE defined a roadmap for 2020 and 2030. RE's validated targets are intensity based. This target is equivalent to Int 1 (and lead to absolute reductions proved by SBT). General target 2030: Reduction of 30% of total Scope 1 and 2 emissions (compared to base year 2015). This target includes transmission losses (95% of Scope 1+Scope2 in base year). It is important to explain that REE (main society of RE Group), as the operator of the electricity system cannot make decisions regarding the main factors that affects energy losses and emissions associated to them. Losses mainly depend on the geographical location units with respect to consumption areas, the generation mix, the size of the grid, the international power exchanges, the voltage level and the demand curve. The assessment of generation is based on market rules and performed by an independent body (not REE). REE must comply with operational procedures defined by the regulator (mandatory procedures) and according to them, it is not possible to operate the system with an energy losses reduction criteria. For this reason, it is very difficult for RE to establish targets to reduce emissions from energy losses. Nevertheless, RE has considered losses in the general targets, in order to be in accordance with SBTi criteria and to stress its commitment and ambition towards climate change and energy transition. RE has a crucial role in renewable energy integration and RE's activity is needed to increase the % of renewable energy in the energy mix. The more renewable energy is integrated, the emission factor (tCO2e) is lower and emissions decrease.In 2020, the emission factor has decreased significantly due to the integration of renewable energy, but also due to the reduction of energy generated by coal, mainly associated with the acceleration of certain policies related to the energy transition in Spain. RE has already committed to review reduction targets to increase their ambition and align them to the 1.5C scenario. The new targets will be published at the end of 2021."

"REN has a target associated with the reduction of SF6 leakages in its high voltage equipment to 0.15% in 2012. Leakage rate is defined as the ratio between the SF6 mass effectively leaked into the atmosphere and the total quantity installed in REN's substations. Taking into account the importance of this GHG, in 2013, REN has redefined this target in order to achieve a reduction to a leakage rate of 0,02% in 2020. In 2020 the leakage rate was 0,044%.In 2019 REN committed to set science-based emissions reduction targets across all relevant scopes, in line with 1.5°C emissions scenarios under the United Nations Global Compact ''Business Ambition for 1,5ºC” initiative and in 2020 has been working in the sbti target defintion."

"This target refers to our emission reduction plans (Scopes 1 and 2) to reduce energy and carbon intensity through operational efficiency measures. In 2020 we have concluded the period 2014-2020 (reported in Abs1). In a longer term, these plans led to a reduction of 5.5 million tons over the period spanning from 2006 to 2020. During 2020, the Company successfully completed its 2014- 2020 reduction plan, thus achieving a reduction of 2.4 Mt CO2e above and beyond the target of 2.1, the extra reduction is due to a decrease of the activity due to pandemic COVID-19. In 2020 the reduction achieved is 440 ktCO2e. Repsol also defined a new plan for the 2021-2025 horizon (reported in Abs2) in a bid to achieve a further reduction of 1.5 million metric tons of CO2 by 2025, including, among others measures, electrification projects, the energy integration of units, process optimization and efficient operation of plants and facilities.

In June 2016, Repsol joined the Zero Routine Flaring by 2030 initiative of the World Bank, in pursuit of technically and economically feasible solutions to minimize routine flaring as soon as possible and by no later than 2030 at its Upstream operated facilities. Since then, work has been done to improve the inventory of emissions due to gas flaring year by year, segregating this inventory into routine and nonroutine flaring, applying the definitions of the Global Gas Flaring Reduction initiative of the World Bank and ensuring a standard approach to the process among OGCI companies. Repsol established a target of achieving a 50% reduction in CO2e emissions from routine flaring activity by 2025, in relation to E&P operated assets and with 2018 as the base year. In 2020, routine flaring emissions were up due to increased production at the most flaring intensive assets and the improvements made to make the measurement methodology more precise. Overall this led to a 52% increase in emissions from routine flaring in respect of the base year (2018). This increase will not undermine progress toward the 2025 target, as key reduction actions have been envisioned to minimize flaring at the Company"

"We have adopted an aggressive target for reducing our operational GHG emissions, approved by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi).Goal: Reduce absolute total Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions 35% by 2030.Scope 1 emissions include emissions from landfills and fleet that are owned, leased, or operated by Republic. From the baseline year of 2017 to 2020, Republic achieved an 15.59% reduction in Scope 1 fleet emissions and an 16.75% reduction in total Scope 2 emissions (See 2020 GRI topic 305-1, and topic 305-5, respectively). Our Scope 1 landfill emissions decreased by 0.43% (See 2019 GRI topic 305-1). This results in a total Scope 1 and Scope 2 decrease of 1.34% over 2017, resulting in 1.6% of target achieved. We do not believe the landfill portion of the Scope 1 emissions is reflective of our performance. Landfill emissions are calculated using U.S. 40 CFR Part 98 Subpart HH, a method developed by the EPA and industry to characterize the contribution of landfills in relationship to the overall greenhouse gas footprint in the U.S. This method remains the current method for reporting landfill emissions to the EPA. However, these calculations are not well suited to tracking progress or reductions at individual landfills.As an example, Republic completed a landfill gas system expansion at Blue Ridge Landfill in 2019. This resulted in an increase of collected landfill gas by more than 13%, as measured by our gas collection system, which indicates a significant reduction in fugitive emissions. However, Republic utilized federally mandated reporting requirements, a projection model that illustrates an increase in the calculated GHG emissions from this site. Republic increased biogas collection by 1.48% across all landfills in 2020.We continue using the federally mandated methodology to reflect our landfill emissions until we develop the means for more accurate and continuous measurement, which we have committed to investigate in support of our science-based GHG emissions target."
"When Resolute joined the elite World Wildlife Fund® (WWF®) Climate Savers program in November 2011, we made commitments that were among the most ambitious in our global industry to reduce our GHG emissions. We committed to reducing absolute GHG emissions (scope 1 and 2) to 65% of 2000 levels by 2015. At the end of 2015, our reduction had reached an impressive 70%, and Resolute's participation in the program was completed with the expiration of the five-year term of the agreement. By the end of 2020, we had reduced our GHG emissions by 85% compared to year 2000 level (previously reported as 83.4%, and adjusted in July 2021 according to updated emission factors from our electricity suppliers).This achievement reflects a company-wide focus on improved energy efficiency and has led to switching from fossil fuels to less carbon-intensive energy sources, such as hydroelectricity, carbon-neutral biomass, and natural gas. Our 65% goal was an industry-leading GHG reduction target, and we want to ensure our future commitments reflect our global industry leadership in this respect. As a member of the Forest Products Association of Canada (FPAC), Resolute has signed on to its ''30 by 30” Climate Change Challenge, which commits the Canadian forest products industry to removing 30 megatons of CO2 per year by 2030 – more than 13% of the Canadian government's total emission reduction target. This target covers our facilities located in Canada. For our facilities located in the United States, we worked with the American Forest and Paper Association (AFPA) to support its goal of achieving at least a 20% reduction of member GHG emissions intensity from 2005 levels by 2020. AF&PA members achieved a 23.2% reduction of absolute GHG emissions in 2019 compared to 2005.Company-wide, Resolute evaluates on an ongoing basis potential projects that could lead to additional GHG reductions, and continues investing in such capital projects. We also invest in energy efficiency projects and technologies to reduce our energy costs and emissions (both scope 1 and 2). In parallel, we continue to follow the climate plans of jurisdictions in which we operate, and support setting ambitious goals for the coming years."
"Resolute announced a commitment to reduce absolute greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (scope 1 and 2) by 30% against 2015 levels by 2025. This new target builds on the company's 85% reduction in absolute GHG emissions from year-2000 levels, two-thirds of which reflect reductions in emission intensity. By achieving it, the company will have reduced its emissions by nearly 700,000 metric tons of CO2 equivalents per year compared to its 2015 level.In July 2021, we received updated emission factors from the electricity suppliers for some of our largest U.S. operations. We had used 2019 emission factors to establish our 2025 target, and for reporting our 2020 GHG emissions. Due to the updated numbers, our progress toward achieving the 2025 target was significantly accelerated. The target is now currently under review, and we are considering aligning it with the Science-based Target Initiative."
"Our SBTi target is an absolute contraction of emissions associated with our Scopes 1 and 2 (Market) footprint by 50%. This target encompasses 100% of emissions in our Scopes 1 and 2 footprint. Scopes 1 and 2 emissions are higher this year than last year, as it may take a few years to implement changes that will result in emissions reductions in the coming years before the target."
"The target has been defined over a period beginning in 2010 and ending by 2020. As a distributor, the Rexel Group's direct carbon footprint (known as ''Scope 1”) is quite low. These direct emissions include emissions linked to the consumption of primary energy (mainly natural gas and domestic fuel oil) and fuel for transport carried out by company vehicles. Indirect Scope 2 emissions include emissions linked to the production of electricity and heat consumed by the Rexel Group sites. Rexel had already reduced its GHG emissions from operations (Scope 1 and 2) by 38.5% in 2019, outreaching its goal to reduce emissions by 30% compared to 2010 baseline. It was confirmed in 2020, achieving a decrease by 53.8%."
"In 2019, Rexel has submitted its commitments to the the Science Base Targets initiative,This target to reduce Scope 1 and 2 emissions (100% of scopes 1 and 2 fall under this target for both base year and 2020) by 35% by 2030 compared to 2016 was officially approved by the SBT initiative in October 2019.Rexel's reduction target for Scope 1 and 2 is considered ambitious by the Science Based Targets initiative since it exceeds  the minimum ambition for well-below 2°C pathway defined by the absolute contraction approach.At the end of 2020, the Group had already succeeded in reducing them by 25.4% compared to 2016.The base year data for scope 1 and 2 emissions declared to the SBT initiative was 114,563 tCO2. It was restated to 116,829  tCO2 in order to take into account the scope 2 emissions upwards revision following amendments applied a posteriori to the figures relating to the electricity consumption of the American entity."
"In 2018 an extra company has been acquired. Also because of this the amount of waste has gone up significantly. Because no data about the amount of waste generated before 2018 from this company, we have revised this target with base year in 2018.The company has grown with 5% in volume sold, where the amount of waste has grown more. The aim is to reduce the amount of waste that goes into incineration. One of the reasons we see is that also in the non-digital productions the order volumes decrease, which resulted in a lot more set-up waste than anticipated."
"We consider this as a science-based target based on the data that has been submitted to the science based initiative. The request has been sent  to the science based imitative via the letter: 'Science based Targets Call to Action Target Setting Letter for Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises.'   The covered emissions in base year  has been changed from last year because for the Spanish site no location based scope 2 was used in 2018. The group had a 13% growth in sold volume 2020 vs 2018. Scope 1 and scope 2 emissions have gone up with 2,0%  where the goal is a significant decrease. One of the reasons for this is because the investments in the solar panels haven't shown in the  data yet.Our company organically grows about 2,5% every year. We foresee that in the near future also the energy consumption will increase. We have noticed that the electricity that we buy from the grid is getting more generated from sustainable sources and therefore the conversion factors are decreasing . This will potentially have a positive impact on achieving this objective. By installing solar panels and locally generated electricity from renewable sources, we want to reduce the amount of electricity bought from the grid and by this further decrease the absolute CO2(e) scope 2 emissions.With the electrification of the company fleet in the coming years we foresee that the scope 1 CO2(e) emissions will go down with 2-4% due to this."
"This target is revised from the ID: Abs 1 in CDP2019 C 4.1a. Ricoh reviewed the ""Ricoh Group environmental goals"", and revised up the GHG (Greenhouse Gas) reduction target of direct emission for 2030 from the original 30% to 63% (compared to the 2015 level). This is an ambitious goal aiming to reach the target value?30%) in 2022, eight years earlier than the originally planned 2030. Ricoh had these new environmental goals approved by the international initiative ""SBT initiative (SBTi)"" as aligned to its new criteria ""1.5°C target""."
"This target is revised from the ID: Abs 2 in CDP2019 C 4.1a. Ricoh reviewed the ""Ricoh Group environmental goals"", and revised up the GHG (Greenhouse Gas) reduction target of Scope3 emission for 2030 from the original 15% to 20% (compared to the 2015 level). Ricoh had these new environmental goals approved by the international initiative ""SBT initiative (SBTi)"" as aligned to its new criteria ""1.5-degree goal"".  The scope of this target is the total of categories 1, 4, and 11. And also, in March 2021, Ricoh revised up the GHG reduction target of scope3 emission for 2030 from 20 % to 40%. This target have not been certified yet by the SBT."
This target is revised from the ID: Abs 3 in CDP2019 C 4.1a. It has been successfully reapproved by the SBTi as 1.5-degree goal in Feb. 2020.
"The Ricoh Group has set and worked on medium- to long-term CO2 reduction targets in 2017, but in light of the drastic changes in the external environments, we revised the targets to achieve zero GHG emissions in the entire value chain by 2050. We have revised from the medium- to long-term target based on the conventional RCP2.6 scenario to the new SBTi target ""1.5 degree level, which is well below 2 degrees and pursues efforts to achieve 1.5 degrees"".New Environmental targets(Scope1,2)-2022 target: 774 t-CO2 (30% of emissions reduction compared to FY2015 levels)-2030 target: 410 t-CO2 (63% of emissions reduction compared to FY2015 levels)-2050 target 0 t-CO2(Scope3)-Reduce category 1 and 13 emissions by 20% from FY2015"

"In 2019, we looked at our operations in detail to explore emission reduction opportunities for each asset and developed corresponding marginal abatement cost curves. This comprehensive work informed our 2030 targets which are to reduce our emissions intensity by 30% and our absolute emissions by 15%, measured against a baseline of 2018. We use the equity share approach for consolidating our total Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions, to which we apply the benefit of our use of valid offsets. This approach applies to both absolute and intensity calculations, where our equity share of production from managed and non-managed operations is used when determining our GHG emissions intensity. In order to account for the different commodities across our business, our production is calculated on a copper equivalent basis.In specific circumstances we may apply appropriate adjustments to the 2018 baseline data. Acquisitions and divestments will result in a commensurate adjustment to the baseline to include (acquisition) or exclude (divestment) the relevant operation from the baseline. Permanent closure of assets will not result in any adjustment to the baseline. Similarly, we will not adjust the baseline if our global production increases from the expansion of existing operations or new projects, such as Winu in Australia or Jadar in Serbia. These growth projects are expected to be carbon neutral overall so that we can deliver against our absolute and intensity targets."
We only started measuring our emissions in 2020 and set a low target to reduce our carbon emissions by 1% as our energy consumption is already very low.  As soon as we have all our emission data in for this year we will be able to determine if we have managed to meet or exceed that target.  The results of this will determine any targets for future years.
"This target refers to the energy we generate ourselves and the volume we purchase for manufacturing, R&D and administration (scopes 1 and 2 of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, GHG). This is where we can directly influence the reduction of greenhouse gases and make a big impact in a short time. We aim to be climate neutral worldwide as of 2020.  Although we intend to reduce the use of carbon credits to a minimum in the coming years, they will be necessary on a transitional basis to offset unavoidable CO? emissions from combustion processes (heating, process heat) and to offset electricity sourced in countries with only limited availability of green electricity.  As the SBTi does not aknowledge offsetting, we also excluded the effect of carbon credits here, i.e. a reduction target of 85 % instead of 100 %."
"The significant decrease in 2020 also partly reflects reduced sales volumes on account of the Covid-19 pandemic.With its scope 3 target, Bosch has deliberately set itself a very ambitious goal as upstream and downstream emissions. In addition, the target value was set independently of sales growth, which means the mitigation target will increase steadily as the company grows in the future. There are also a large number of external factors Bosch can only influence indirectly, such as suppliers' success reducing CO2 emissions. We are pursuing a three-stage approach to make sure we achieve our goals. In a first step, in 2019 we analyzed all scope 3 categories in accordance with the GHG Protocol using external databases and then focused on those from which the majority (99 percent) of CO? emissions originate. According to the findings, upstream emissions in the Bosch value chain primarily concern purchased goods and services as well as logistics. Downstream emissions are mainly caused by the use of our products. However, it is not possible to measure a company's specific progress based on database values. In 2020, we therefore went one step further and increased the calculation's granularity for the main categories, while also integrating specific parameters into the models. This finer-grained calculation makes it possible, among other things, to identify significant drivers within purchasing and in the use of our products, based on which we can derive measures that make an active and measurable contribution to climate action. In this process, we focus primarily on options that lie within our immediate sphere of influence.We are continuously refining our calculation methodology in order to obtain as realistic a picture as possible of our scope 3 emissions and thus meet our standards with respect to transparency and completeness. In 2020, for example, we expanded the approach to our emissions in Mobility Solutions from a solely tank-to-wheel perspective to a well-to-wheel analysis in order to comprehensively reflect the CO2 emissions of mobility. Although this refinement of the calculation raises our baseline, we nevertheless remain committed to the ambitious target of a 15 percent absolute reduction in scope 3 emissions."
"In 2017, the Group Robertet set the target to reduce scopes 1 and 2 emissions by 10% by 2025 compared with a 2017 base year. Target coverage concerns the head office (Robertet SA in Grasse), and all the Group's industrial subsidiaries.In 2020, we decided to exclude sales subsidiaries as they represent less than 5% of out GHG emissions. In 2020, we included our new industrial acquisition, Sirius.Robertet didn't improve its GHG emissions between 2017 and 2020 for several reasons:-CSR department, created in January 2020 analysed the 2017 and 2018 consolidated data and found significant errors in previous calculations. It turns out that 2017 and 2018 data are under estimated. That's why the 2017 baseline has evolved but it was not possible to reclaculte all the 2017 data. To overcome this problem, the CSR department is implementing a new CSR strategy, with new targets on GHG emissions reduction, based on 2020 data. These targets will be implemented by the end of 2021 (next CDP).- A new reporting tool was implemented in 2020, and the calculation ofGHG emissions has been deepened. Emissions related to refrigerant leaks, as well as emissions related to vehicle consumption have been added in 2020. It was not possible to add back these emissions from previous years (2019, 2018 and 2017). All sources of GHG have been taken into account in 2020 on scopes 1 and 2, which automatically increases the Group's GHG emissions in 2020 compared to previous years.-The Robertet Group is in the process of modernizing its factories in order, among other things, to improve the working environment of employees. However, this air conditioning equipment consumes energy."
Goal is to be net neutral by 2030 for all Scopes 1 and 2 emissions.  Scope 3 emissions study is underway and is anticipated to be incorporated into this goal and publicized as a 1.5 or 2.0 degree goal under TCFD.
ROCKWOOL Group commits to reduce absolute scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 38% by 2034 from a 2019 base year. ROCKWOOL Group also commits to reduce absolute scope 3 emissions by 20% within the same timeframe. The targets covering greenhouse gas emissions from company operations (scopes 1 and 2) are consistent with reductions required to keep warming to Well-below 2°C.

"Rogers has established a target of reducing Scope 1 & 2 GHG emissions by 25% (49,362 metric tonnes) from the 2011 base year (of 197,448 metric tonnes) by the year 2025. The Base year emissions of 197,448 metric tonnes - 148,118 (2020) = 49,330 metric tonnes = 24.98% reduction from the base year (41,245/197,448) x 100.Energy use and climate change continue to be our highest environmental priority. Rogers has integrated climate-related risks and opportunities into our business strategy and priorities. Every year, the Rogers Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) program carries out a strategic risk assessment to identify key risks, avoidance strategies and residual risks to achieving our corporate objectives. Our Executive Leadership Team (ELT) reviews and approves those key corporate residual risks before they are presented to the Audit and Risk Committee. Any material changes to our risk profile are managed and reported quarterly to the ELT and Audit and Risk Committee. Each year, we conduct an environmental materiality assessment, which defines priority areas for which we continually build programs, targets and metrics.  The ESG Committee is responsible for the oversight of the overall strategic direction of our sustainability programs. In supporting the ESG Committee, our ELT with oversight of all business units manages these programs. Since 2006, Rogers has assessed the performance of our annual energy use and carbon emission across our operations, as a means of evaluating the effectiveness of our energy reduction programs and associated GHG emissions (our calculation of GHG emissions follows the World Resources Institute Greenhouse Gas Protocol methodology).We manage our Corporate Environmental Program within the Corporate Real Estate team, under the Energy and Sustainability group. Oversight and guidance of our Corporate Environmental Program is provided by three committees: The Energy Executive Council; The Energy Operations Committee; The Environmental Compliance Committee which are comprised of cross-functional senior representatives to support and advance our strategies and program effectiveness  and inform our Executive Leadership Team.For the ninth consecutive year, we engaged KPMG LLP (KPMG) to provide limited assurance on our annual energy use and GHG emissions (Scope 1 and 2)."
"ROHM established Environmental Vision 2050 in FY2020, with the target of achieving zero GHG emissions by 2050.In addition, as a medium-term target, we have set a target to reduce GHG emissions from all domestic and overseas sites by 30% in 2030 compared to FY2018."
"RWG reported its first submission under SECR and is in the process of creating a decarbonisation road map. Therefore, this current target will become obsolete as RWG will be adopting a science based target later this year for decarbonisation and intensity ratios for SECR."
Over next 5 years we predicted to reduce CO2 emission approximately in 5% annually
"We targeted a 2% year-on-year reduction in energy and gas consumption normalised for degree days, to deliver an associated reduction in CO2 emissions. The target covers our groupwide global operations. We achieved this target for 2020."
"In 2018, we set a new science-based target aligned absolute GHG reduction target, which is to reduce emissions by at least 2.5% per year and by 15% by 2023 (based on a 2018 baseline). We used the science-based target methodology based on the guidance for real estate and office properties as this target is for our own operational footprint. We decided to use a 2018 baseline because we significantly increased the amount of our global footprint we reported on in 2018 (up to over 99% of our total global floor area compared with 90% in 2017 and 89% in 2016).As we achieved our target 4 years early, we updated our targets. In July 2020 we announced in connection with our renewable energy Power Purchase Agreements that RBC will reduce its operational emissions (Scope 1 +2 + business travel) by 70% by 2025, and increase our sourcing of renewable and non-emitting energy to 100% by 2025 (up from 90% by 2023).http://www.rbc.com/newsroom/news/2020/20200728-renewal-evergy-ppa.html"
"In 2020, we set two new targets: a reduction in our absolute GHG emissions by 70% with a baseline year of 2018 and an increase in our sourcing of electricity from renewable and non-emitting sources to 100%, both by 2025.http://www.rbc.com/newsroom/news/2020/20200728-renewal-evergy-ppa.html"
"Abs1 - CCS QuestThe Quest Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) facility captures and stores about one third of the CO2 emissions from the Shell-operated Scotford Upgrader near Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta, Canada which turns oil sands bitumen into synthetic crude that can be refined into fuel and other products. The CO2 is transported through a 65-kilometre pipeline and injected more than two kilometres underground below multiple layers of impermeable rock formations. It is designed to capture, transport and store over one million tonnes of CO2 annually. Shell operates the Quest CCS project (Shell interest 10%) which captured and safely stored more than 0,94 million tonnes of carbon dioxide from the Scotford Upgrader in 2020. The target year 2025 is based on a 10-year contract starting at the time of the project launch in 2015. We have put 100% of target achieved as the facility is storing close to one million tonnes of CO2 annually. Quest has a robust measurement, monitoring and verification programme verified by a third party (Det Norske Veritas (DNV)) to ensure the CO2 is permanently stored. By the end of 2020, for example, our Quest CCS project in Canada (Shell interest 10%) had captured and safely stored more than 5.5 million tonnes of CO2 since it began operating in 2015."
"Abs2 - World Bank Zero Routine Flaring by 2030 initiative(Annual Report 2020, p106) In 2015, we signed up to the World Bank's Zero Routine Flaring by 2030 initiative. This seeks to ensure that all stakeholders, including governments and companies, work together to address routine flaring. The only routine flaring in 2020 occurred in assets operated by the Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria Limited (SPDC).Flaring, or burning off, of gas in our Upstream and Integrated Gas businesses contributed around 6% of our overall direct GHG emissions in 2020. Around 35% of this flaring occurred at facilities where there was no infrastructure to capture the gas produced with oil, known as associated gas.Around 45% of flaring in our Upstream and Integrated Gas facilities in 2020 occurred in assets operated by the Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria Limited (SPDC). Flaring from SPDC-operated facilities decreased by around 15% in 2020 compared with 2019.The level of flaring in our Upstream and Integrated Gas businesses combined decreased by around 35% compared with 2019. In 2019, our Prelude floating LNG facility in Australia had experienced an unanticipated spike in flaring during its start-up. In February 2020, we had to shut down Prelude which resulted in a decrease of its GHG emissions by around 80% compared with 2019."
"Abs3 – Net-zero Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions from our operations (manufacture of all products) by 2050, in step with societyShell aims to be net-zero on all the emissions from the manufacture of all our products, including non-energy products. That includes our operational emissions (Scope 1) and the emissions associated with the energy we consume through those operations (Scope 2). Shell will track and report on progress towards achieving net-zero emissions from its operations. We will reduce emissions from our own operations, including the production of oil and gas, by increasing energy efficiency and capturing or offsetting any remaining emissions.Note: The methodology for assessing Science-Based Targets for the oil and gas industry does not exist yet. Shell is part of the technical working group for its development.Shell's operating plans, outlooks and budgets are forecasted for a 10-year period and are updated every year. They reflect the current economic environment and how we can reasonably expect our business to develop over the next 10 years. Our short-term targets are aligned with our current operating plans."
"Abs4 - Net-zero Scope 3 emissions from the energy products we sellOur Scope 3 emissions include our customers' emissions from the energy products we produce and sell as well as the life-cycle emissions of the energy products produced by other companies that we resell to our customers. This means that our target covers all the energy we sell, not just the oil and gas we produce and refine ourselves. We will work with our customers to address the emissions created when they use products bought from us (Scope 3) and help them find ways to reduce their emissions and overall carbon footprint to net zero by 2050.Retail sales volumes from markets where Shell operates under trademark licensing agreements are excluded from the scope of Shell's carbon intensity metric. Emissions associated with the manufacturing and use of non-energy products are excluded.Shell's operating plans, outlooks and budgets are forecasted for a 10-year period and are updated every year. They reflect the current economic environment and how we can reasonably expect our business to develop over the next 10 years. Our short-term targets are aligned with our current operating plans."

We have followed the Science Based Target (SBT) methodology to the extent possible in setting this target, prior to the release of the financial services guidelines.  As our target was set prior to an available methodology it is not currently approved. Following the April 2021 release of an agreed methodology for financial services from the Science Based Target Initiative, we plan to work alongside our new parent company Intact and external consultants to review our target and ensure it remains in line with current science-based guidelines. The significant reduction in emissions in 2020 reflects in part the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on travel restrictions."

"As a manufacturer based in the small island of Mauritius, RT Knits feels very concerned about the climate change phenomenon. In December 2019, we became a signatory of the Fashion Industry Charter for Climate Action (under the auspices of UNFCCC) and committed to a collaborative approach to address the impacts of the fashion industry and support the world reaching climate neutrality by 2050. By supporting this initiative, we recognise the critical need to implement the Paris Agreement and accelerate the transformative change needed to win the race against climate change!As a signatory, RT Knits shares this ambition and commits to pursuing a target of 50% GHG emission reduction by 2030 and a commitment to analyse and set a decarbonisation pathway for the textile and fashion industry drawing on methodologies from the Science-Based Targets Initiative.In August 2020, RT Knits joined the Business Ambition for 1.5°C Campaign and officially committed to set science based targets to bring our emissions down in line with what the science tells us is needed.This commitment to science-based targets will enable RT Knits to continue developing goals, strategies and actions to tackle the challenges of climate change in the medium and long term and will subsequently lead us to a low carbon economy.We have established key priorities based on the energy pyramid to help us achieve these targets:Priority 1: Energy Conservation (Behavioural approach)                      a. Awareness and users' trainings                      b.  Good housekeepingPriority 2: Energy efficiency                        a. New investments and process innovation                        b.

"Target coverage: Rubis's scope 1&2 emissions which represents 94% of the Group wide's scope 1&2 emissions.Rubis Énergie has developed an action plan to reduce its CO2 emissions. The plan was designed after extensive consultation with subsidiaries and functional departments, with the support of consultants specialized in each of its key business lines (land transportation, shipping, refining, storage site management). On the basis of this consolidated action plan, defined for the 2019-2030 period, the Group has set a target for reducing emissions directly linked to its operational activities (scopes 1 and 2). The levers identified to achieve this target are based on initiatives by RubisÉnergie and its subsidiaries, as well as on technological and regulatory advances by partners and suppliers in the means used directly by the Group to operate.The target is a 20% reduction by 2030 (vs. 2019), with the aim of taking it to -32% under favourable technological and regulatory conditions. Ultimately, the goal is to reduce the carbon footprint across all scopes."
"Prior to validation of science-based emissions targets by the SBTi which is on our strategic roadmap, we have set a new Scope 1 and 2 (location-based) emissions reduction targets of 15% by 2026 from a 2019 base year. These cover 100% of Scope 1 and 2 (location-based) emissions.  We acknowledge some of our achieved reductions to date pertaining to these targets are accounted for by COVID-19- related business disruptions and we anticipate some natural rebound over the coming years as the disruptions of COVID-19 subside, thus we consider the target status to be new and underway in the reporting year, rather than 'Achieved'."
"In April 2018 RusHydro adopted GHG emissions reduction targets through 2025. The year 2015 was set as the base year. Both absolute values and GHG intensity metrics is are included.

"Climate protection and climate-protection measures constitute key elements of our corporate strategy. This is reflected in the new target that have been announced in 2019 with our strategy update: We intend to meet the ambition to be carbon neutral in our power generation until 2040 with a major reduction of 75% until 2030 against a 2012 base year.  As an additional step in 2020 we have integrated our Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions in our ambition to be net zero in 2040 - therefore our targets cover all direct and indirect emissions that are accounted for by RWE as per operational control approach.  As an intermediate target we aim to decarbonize our power generation by 75% until 2030 from a 2012 base year."
As part of our 2030 science-based emission reduction target we have introduced a new Scope 3 target that is absolute. We want to reduce these emisions - mainly from our hard coal supply chain and our downstream refinement and trading business - by 30% until 2030.  Our baseline are our updated 2019 GHG emission figures that we reevaluated as part of the transaction with E.ON and the deconsolidation of retail and grid business.
"This aligns with the industry goal of reducing absolute emissions by 50% by 2050, compared with 2005 levels. We are 10.35% of the way there in relation to the reduction timeline."
"In alignment with our sustainability principle to protect our planet, we strive to reduce emissions along our whole value chain. As a leading logistics and transportation company, we have a unique opportunity and ability to continually reduce the environmental impacts of our operations and those of the tens of thousands of customers we serve. Whether we are deploying AFVs, optimizing distribution networks, or operating energy-efficient warehouses and service shops, Ryder helps customer reduce emissions and drive long-term value for their businesses. After meeting our 2020 goal early to reduce Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions 20% over a 2009 baseline, we recently implemented new targets to drive our strategy over the next three years while we finalize our longer term targets. To develop our new emissions targets, we closely tracked and evaluated materials factors that influence our emissions across the value chain. We identified priorities that present the greatest opportunity to reduce emissions and close existing data gaps while evaluating the resources available (and needed) to achieve our goals. Our new goals, which have been reviewed by the Board of Directors, aim to complete the following:-Reduce Scope 1 emissions (company-operated fleet) 10% by 2024, over 2018 baseline;-Reduce Scope 2 emissions (company-operated facilities) 30% by 2024, over 2018 baseline; and,-Reduce Scope 3 emissions (downstream leased equipment) 15% by 2024, over 2018 baseline.The scope 1 target includes Ryder's DTS fleet operations and currently excludes the following fleet activities: UK fleet (2020: 10,256 MTCO2e) and company owned service trucks (319 MTCO2e). Both emissions are included in the emissions reporting."

While we calculate and track emissions across more categories, Scope 3 emissions reported in this section include only those from downstream leased assets (Category 13), as they represent the highest percentage of our Scope 3 (and total emissions) and are the focus of our newest emission reduction target. In future, we will consider additional Scope 3 emission reduction targets."
"S&C has program in place to further reduce our scope 1 emissions. Actions are primarily directed toward SF6 reduction as it is our largest source of GHG emissions.  By 2021, the goal is to reduce scope 1 emission by 20%."
S&C purchases Renewable Energy Credits to counteract Scope 2 emissions associated with electricity consumption.
S Group commits to reduce absolute scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions 90% by 2030 from a 2015 base year.  The targets covering greenhouse gas emissions from company operations (scopes 1 and 2) are consistent with reductions required to keep warming to 1.5°C. The target was approved by May 2020.
S&P Global has set a target to become a net-zero organization by 2040. This interim company-wide Scope 1 & 2 target has been validated by the SBTi and is based on our financial year. It covers all our direct operations and is part of the longer-term net-zero ambition.
S&P Global has set a target to become a net-zero organization by 2040. This interim company-wide Scope 3 business travel target has been validated by the SBTi and is based on our financial year. It covers all our business travel and is part of the longer-term net-zero ambition.
"The target covers 100 % of emission in scope 1 and 2 and 100 % emission in scope 3 within the categories Upstream transportation and Distribution, Business Travel and Leased Assets (upstream leased assets are now included in scope 2). The target is aligned with the Paris Agreement's goal to limit the increase in global average temperature to below 2 degree Celsius above pre-industrial levels.  Saab's target is based on IPCC scenario RCP 2.6.The values for GHG emissions reported for 2017, 2018 and 2019 have been adjusted during 2020 due to back-tracking. This is because more detailed data has been collected and the analysis methods have been improved"
"This target covers one of our Group companies', i.e. Brisa's (covering ?zmit, Aksaray Production Facilitys', Altunizade, Esenler, Profilo Management Offices in ?stanbul) Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions (base year is 2020 and target year is 2030). The target is to reduce Brisa's absolute CO2e emissions (Scope 1 and 2) by 30% and aspire to reduce by 50% by 2030."
"This target covers one of our Group companies', i.e. Brisa's, ?zmit Production Facility's Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions as base year 2020 and target year 2050. In line with global Bridgestone's and Sabanc? Group's long-term environmental vision for 2050 and beyond, ''Contribute to globally-agreed target (towards carbon neutral society)” Brisa recognizes that the international community aims to become carbon neutral society based on the Paris Agreement, IPCC reports, and subsequent international debates. The Number ''100” written in ''Targeted reduction from base year (%)” is the number of target of international society which Brisa's target refers to. This target covers Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. As base year 2020, it is planned to develop a target regarding decreasing Scope 3 emissions including Brisa's value chain emissions to be a carbon neutral until 2050."
"Çimsa produces three types of (Grey, White, and CAC) cement and ready-mixed concrete. Their total emissions occurred from all types of their products. The target is set for the gross Scope 1 emissions of grey cement production which covers 69% of their total gross Scope 1 emissions. Their gross grey cement Scope 1 emissions for 2017 is 4,148,165 tCO2 and Çimsa aimed to decrease it to 3,940,757 tCO2 by 5% reduction. Çimsa's grey cement Scope 1 emissions are 4,237,076 for the year 2020. The grey cement production has increased by %22 compared to baseline, therefore actual emissions are increased."
"The target covers all Kordsa's gross-global Scope1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions. Kordsa has submitted their commitment to SBTi, and Kordsa will also submit this target. This target is in set to be in line with the well below 2 degrees scenario. Kordsa targets a reduction of 17.5 % from their gross-global Scope1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions, over a period of 7 years, which translates to 2.50 % reduction per year on average. The target is also checked using the target setting tool of SBTi, which resulted in the same reduction figure to be in line with the IEA WB2C using the absolute contraction approach."
"As Sabanc? Holding, we aim to supply all of our electricity from renewable sources by the end of 2022. In this way, we aim to contribute to the net zero emission target by 2050 and reduce our carbon emissions by reducing the scope 2 emissions from electricity. The target covers Holding (business) activities only.Consuming renewable energy was one of our mid-term targets, but with our pledge to conducting sustainable business, we decided to achieve this target as soon as possible and planned it to meet in 2022."
"In 2020, we set a net zero emissions target by 2050 at the latest. In the coming 2 years, we will conduct a detailed assessment including those that are related to technology gaps and residual emission management strategies and set our interim targets accordingly, based on international methodologies. After this assessment we will launch a transition pathway towards our net zero emissions goal."
"There are limited ways to provide emission reduction in cement production with the existing technologies. One of them is increasing the use of alternative fuels. Based on Sabanc? Holding's commitment to being net-zero Cimsa also started to define its low carbon transition plan. The first phase is the target set to increase the use of alternative fuel by 23%. 1% increase in alternative fuel use provides a 0.2% reduction in Scope 1 emissions. Therefore, 23% increase in alternative fuel use will lead to about 4.6% emission reduction.Çimsa produces three types of (Grey, White, and CAC) cement and ready-mixed concrete and all types of our products are included in Çimsa's total emissions. The target is set for the gross Scope 1 emissions of grey cement production which covers 75% of total gross Scope 1 emissions.  Çimsa's gross grey cement Scope 1 emissions for 2020 is 4,237,076 tCO2 and it is targeted to decrease it to 4,042,171 tCO2 by 4.6% reduction."
"This target covers Brisa (?zmit Plant, Aksaray Plant, Altunizade sales office, Esenler and Profilo technical service) Facilities Scope 3 emissions as base year 2020 and target year 2030. Brisa commits to reduce absolute scope 3 GHG emissions from purchased goods and services, fuel and energy related activities, upstream transportation and distribution and franchises 14.2% within the same timeframe.Total scope 3 emissions amount of Brisa 148.282,89 t-CO2e in 2020.Total emissions covered by target (purchased goods and services, fuel and energy related activities, upstream transportation and distribution and franchises) is 125.468,23 tCO2e namely 84,61% of total scope 3 emissions.14.2% reduction target is belong to this total emissions covered by target. Means that 17.760,97 t-CO2e."
"Sacyr joined the Business Ambition for 1.5ºC in 2019, whereby it undertook to define and validate science-based targets. The submission of the already defined targets was recently completed (23/07/2021), being waiting for the initiative official respond to our proposal. However, we have modelized our target using SBTi absolute contraction method and criteria; therefore, we are confident of its upcoming approval.Through this initiative we aim to be aligned with the objective of the United Nations to limit to 1.5ºC the increase of global temperature at age-old levels pre-industrial.These science-based targets are aimed at reducing the carbon footprint corresponding to the different operations developed by the Group. Among the many benefits that they entail are:•to deepen carbon management;•boosting innovation;•anticipating legal requirements;•strengthening investor confidence;•improving profitability and competitive positioning."

"Although this target has not been approved by the SBTi, it is aligned with Sacyr's commitment to the Business Ambition for 1.5ºC made back in 2019. It reflects the main aim of the company's new Climate Change Strategy which developpes actions in order to tackle the impact of climate change, reducing emissions to the minimum, considering climate-related risks from a crosswise perspective."
"We have set ourselves science-based target with year 2017 as base year. The targets were approved in 2019. Our main focus has been to reduce scope 1  emissions especially related to fuel usage for energy generation in  our operations. Over the years, we have been having back-up gensets in our network equipment. This is due to power instability in most areas of the country. However, to reduce fuel usage in stand-by generators we continue to invest in clean and renewable energy solutions as well as hybrid energy solutions where generators are not used to power the sites but rather to charge deep cycle batteries for use during power outages. Deep cycle batteries We have also worked connecting most of our sites to electricity from national grid (largely green from Hyro and geothermal). This has reduced the need to use gensets especially in remote sites."
"This target is related to our electricity consumption.  We have two main sources of emissions for our scope 1 and 2 emissions.  Fuel used in generators (scope 1) and electricity (scope 2) used in our network infrastructure. We have been focusing to reduce fuel usage in diesel generators by extending national electricity to most of our sites. The reason being, for Kenya the national grid is largely from renewable energy sources (Hyro and Geothermal)Though this has seen us reduce our scope 1 emissions,  our scope 2 emissions (electricity) has gone up as we connect power to  our network which continues to grow as we expand to ensure 100 percent coverage of the country.Therefore,  main reason for increase in scope 2 is because   expansion of  our network sites as well as connecting most of this sites to the national grid."
"The target reduction objective was designed using the Science-Based Targets methodology and tool with the Sectorial Decarbonization Approach (2DS scenario).Due to the impact of the Covid-19 crisis, Safran revised these targets for a higher ambition. As such, the Group now aims to reduce its Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 30% by 2025 compared with 2018."

"Until 2020, greenhouse gas emission reduction targets were as follows: 8% on Scope 1 and 18% on Scope 2 by 2025 compared with 2018.In early 2021, due to the impact of the Covid-19 crisis, Safran revised these targets twith a higher ambition. As such, the Group now aims to reduce its Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 30% by 2025 compared with 2018. This more ambitious target was set to be consistent with emissions reductions compatible with a 1.5°C scenario by the end of the century, based on the SBTi methodology. In 2020, Safran reduced its Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 33.5% compared with 2019. This outcome chiefly reflects the drop in business in the wake of the Covid-19 crisis, even though initial emission reduction actions had been undertaken.The target reduction objective was designed using the Science-Based Targets methodology and tool with an Absolute Contraction Approach - 1.5DS scenario. The -30% objective covers both aspect of our Scope 2 emissions : location and market-based. We didn't segregate the objective over the two aspects and are planning to disclose both but focus our objective on the market based approach to be consistent with the SBTi methodology. Safran is currently finalizing the market based calculation.It is Safran's decision to implement it over the entire company's Scope 1+2 emissions. 100% of these emissions were taken into account when designing the reduction objectives."
"We set a science-based target for our scope 1&2 emissions as this is where our most material emissions are (currently 98% of our emissions scope 1,2&3). The overall increase in emissions is largely due to an increase in marine fuel due to the purchasing of a new ship, ‘Spirit of Discovery'. We expect to see a reduction in emissions as we move to this more efficient ship."

"In our Energy & Environmental Policy there was a commitment to reduce CO2 emissions by 5% by 2020, relative to 2015 emissions. With the reduction in offices through our Geographical Location Strategy and adoption of several energy efficient systems and controls, we have surpassed this target and are in the process of reviewing our Energy & Environmental Policy to develop new stretch targets."

"Compared to last year, our target has been updated with 2030 as target year (vs 2025 previously) in a well-below 2°C trajectory (vs 2°C previously). Both target and reference years include our 2019 acquisition of Continental Building Products in North America. Our 2020 result is linked to this integration, but also partly to both performance and activity in the frame of the COVID19 pandemic."
"Compared to last year, our target has been updated with 2030 as target year (vs 2025 previously) in a well-below 2°C trajectory (vs 2°C previously). In 2019, the Group has updated its Scope 3 evaluation, using 2017 as reference, and making the methodology and data more robust for each category. The % of target achieved is at zero because the study is not updated every year: it will be updated with 2021."
"Salcomp (Guigang) was built at 2017, after 4 years growth, the production value increased, and the management level enhance to higher level, the GHG inventory management enhance too. We have set SBTi target,  the targets include scope1+2, and scope 3, they cover all the manufacturing stages of our products."

"In early FY18, we achieved our target of net-zero Scope 1+2 (market-based) emissions through a combination of internal energy efficiency projects and purchases of renewable energy and carbon offsets. We took this further to deliver our customers a carbon neutral cloud by including indirect emissions (Scope 3) within our data center supply chain, such as the manufacture of servers, production and distribution of energy use at our data centers, and the impact of our customers using Salesforce on their personal devices. We aim to maintain this goal and commitment every year moving forward. Although CDP guidance indicates that this question requests gross emissions which excludes carbon offsets, we have chosen to include offsets as we have met our net-zero operations target. Although our total Scope 1 + 2 (market based) emissions totaled 84,922 in the reporting year, after reconciliation with our high quality carbon offset purchases the total is 0 emissions. Therefore we consider this target to be 100% achieved, as reflected in our verification statements (note due to the auto calculate cells, the 100% will not be reflected).All years listed are our fiscal years (e.g. FY21 was Feb 1, 2020 – Jan 31, 2021). We feel strongly that carbon credits are a viable way to mitigate our impacts on the climate as we prioritize emissions reductions and avoidance. In FY20 we set an SBTi-approved science-based target that aligns with 1.5 degree emission reduction trajectory for Scope 1+2 (market-based emissions), reported in Abs 4. We will, however, continue to purchase high quality carbon credits to continually achieve our net-zero goal."
"In FY20, we committed to set 1.5°C science-based emissions reduction targets aligned with a zero carbon future.  This is the first year we are reporting our progress against this target. All years listed are our fiscal years (e.g. FY21 was Feb 1, 2020 – Jan 31, 2021)."
"We are reporting on location-based fuel and energy related activities (FERA) for this year's target reporting. However, moving forward, we may change our approach to reflect market-based results to track progress against our target (similar to using Scope 2 MB to track against targets)."
The target is to reduce 35% of Scope 1 and 2 location emissions in the period from 2018-2030. This includes becoming more energy efficient and to reduce its energy use.
"Before 2020, only wellboat transport and business-related travel were reported under Scope 3, since these are areas over which SalMar had operational control. With effect from 2020, fish feed, downstream transport, waste, and packaging are also included. The emission target relates to all of these elements and the base year is set to 2020, the first year we have included all of these elements."
"The signing of the Fashion Pact in August 2019 further enhanced the commitment taken on by the Group to reduce its environmental impact in terms of climate change. The reduction and offsetting of CO2 emissions is thus one of the priorities established by the Group in its Sustainability Plan. The Group has implemented a Science-Based Targets (SBTs) in line with limiting global warming to 1.5°C. This target is covering scope 1, scope 2 market-based emissions. The Salvatore Ferragamo Group commits to reduce scope 1, scope 2 market-based by 42% by 2029 from a 2019 base-year."

"Salzgitter Group has established a project called SALCOS® (Salzgitter Low CO2 Steelmaking) which deals with the avoidance of CO2 emissions in steel production in an integrated steel mill. The Salzgitter Group operates an integrated steel site in Salzgitter, accounting for roughly 95 % of the group-wide Scope 1 CO2 emissions. Recently the steel production at this site is done via the conventional and worldwide established so called blast furnace / blast oxygen furnace route. Unavoidably on this carbon-based production route, around 1.5 tons of CO2 per ton of crude steel (without emissions e.g. from ore preparation and coke making) occur during the reduction process. This limit has been more or less reached by the steel production in Salzgitter as well as by many other steel sites in Europe. Due to this, Salzgitter Group is investigating an opportunity to produce steel using mainly green hydrogen instead of carbon, leading to far lower CO2 emissions. This would be an approach of carbon direct avoidance (CDA) which differs from other approaches like carbon capture and storage (CCS) or carbon capture and usage (CCU). But such approaches are less energy efficient than SALCOS®. Our project has reached a high publicity in the European politics in the last years, the open question is, whether this technically possible approach can be feasible in Europe in economic terms. Up to 2050 a step by step CO2 reduction up to 95% might be possible from a technical point of view. For the time being a preliminary project phase called MACOR has been finalized successfully a feasibility study, finding out all information needed for SALCOS® potentially. In addition to this, several pilot projects has been built up together with partners at the Salzgitter steel site for testing the integration of hydrogen production into the steel production processes. These are: GrInHy2.0, BeWiSe, Wind Hydrogen Salzgitter – WindH2 and ?DRAL as reported in C-ST9.6a as well."
"This target describes the first step of our SALCOS®-project. Under the constrains mentioned above, we plan to install a first electrical arc furnace, a direct reduction plant and an appropriate capacity of water electrolysis before the year 2030.

"The target covers all waste  generated in operations in our one and only office building.  Sbanken considers  the target to be science-based on the basis of regional, national and global emission targets.  As part of the European Green Deal, the Commission proposed in September 2020 to raise the 2030 greenhouse gas emission reduction target, including emissions and removals, to at least 55% compared to 1990 (https://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/strategies/2030_en).  Norway has submitted a climate target under the Paris agreement. Norway's new and strengthened target is to reduce emissions with at least 50 %, and towards 55 % by 2030 compared to 1990 levels (https://www.regjeringen.no/en/aktuelt/norge-forsterker-klimamalet-for-2030-til-minst-50-prosent-og-opp-mot-55-prosent/id2689679/).  Considering Sbanken's timeframe for the target, reducing our emissions by 50% in ten years with 2019 as base year, we are more ambitious than  both our national goals and the EU goals. As a fully digital bank, Sbanken has a modest climate footprint. The bank is nonetheless concerned with reducing its own emissions and set a goal in 2020 to halve emissions by 2030, with an annual reduction of 10 per cent company-wide.  The reduction is slightly more ambitious that the 7 per cent required to halve the emissions in ten years.  Regarding waste generated in operations, we  fully implemented sorting of food waste or organic waste in 2020 and thereby reduced our proportion of residual waste.  Sbanken reports waste generated in our one and only office building, broken down in the following recycable categories: hazardous waste, electric waste, organic waste, grease from grease separator in the cafeteria, glass and metal, paper and cardboard, and plastic packaging,Residual waste from Sbanken is handled by a company which incinerates it in an energy plant with energy recovery. Energy recovery ensures that waste that cannot be recycled is used as energy. When the waste burns, it is turned into heat and electricity used in homes and commercial buildings. Organic waste is  used for production of biogas."

Due to the pandemic, our employees have not conducted as many flights as in a normal year, thus the reduction.  In such a small company, we see that the majority of the emissions boil down to how many of our employees are based in Oslo and not in Bergen where we have our only office.  We are continuously focusing on facilitating digital working methods, but sometimes managers need to be  physically present for their employees."

"Schaeffler is regularly assessing its production-related Scope 1+2 emissions in accordance with the GHG Protocol as well as its progress towards increasing energy efficiency in context of its energy management system (ISO 50001). The Scope 1+2 emissions in scope of the target correspond with the emissions published in the annual sustainability report and are audited (limited assurance) by a third party. Not in scope are Scope 1 emissions from methanol and diesel consumption and the loss of cooling agents. Emissions from those sources sum up to less than 5% of global Scope 1+2 emissions but are currently not audited.Based on the verified 2020 data as well as production and market outlooks, Schaeffler has defined a renewable power target (target year 2024) as well as an energy efficiency target (target year 2024) in order to improve overall production-related climate performance. Both targets summing up to an overall 75% reduction in production-related Scope 1+2 emissions until 2024. In detail, it is envisaged to cover 100% of externally purchased power for production sites with renewable energy by 2024 globally. In addition, until 2024 on-top measures shall be implemented that will lead to an additional annual energy efficiency increase of 100 GWh. While the renewable power target addresses production-related Scope 2 emissions, the energy efficiency target addresses Scope 1+2 emissions."
"This target refers to Schaeffler's Scope 1 & 2 emissions (according to GHG Protocol) from production and, thus, includes the direct emissions from own operations, e.g. from combustion processes for heat and power generation for manufacturing, R&D and administration, and the indirect emissions from power usage from external sources. Schaeffler has set itself the target, to achieve carbon neutral production in 2030. In this context, concrete emission reduction programs have been established (e.g. the Schaeffler Energy Efficiency Program) and financially endowed. Declared target is to reduce Scope 1+2 emissions to a minimum or even zero. The concrete status in 2030 will depend on the availability of appropriate technologies to avoid CO2e emissions in total at a reasonable cost. With the measures defined today, a reduction of >80% will be achieved. The use of carbon credits as offsetting instrument to reach 100% is intended to be reduced to a minimum. Since Schaeffler's target of a climate-neutral production in 2030 also applies to the period thereafter, we also consider the target to be a long-term target according to the CDP methodology."

"This is an annual emission reduction target and is incorporated into our management incentive program for 2021. Results will be available in 2022. Achievement of this annual target furthers our progress with respect to our medium-term science-based target. Therefore, we consider this annual target to be science-based and 1.5°C aligned."
"At COP22, on behalf of Schneider Electric, our CEO Jean-Pascal Tricoire signed the Science-based targets initiative aimed at setting Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions reduction targets in line with the global effort to limit warming to 2°C. Following the publication of IPCC's SR15 Report, in 2019 we have submitted a new target that was validated by the SBTi, with an increased ambition to achieve -100% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2030, and a -35% emissions from scope 3 within the same period, in line with 1.5°C required levels of ambition.During this work, we have completed the calculation of 100% of our carbon footprint for all scopes in particular by:- including emissions from our company fleet in scope 1 (previously reported but in scope 3)- estimating scope 1 and 2 emissions from sites out of our environmental reporting scope (the scope of environmental reporting is that of ISO 14001 certified sites, and certain non-certified sites on a voluntary basis and without interruption in time. All of the industrial and logistics sites with more than 50 people and the major tertiary sites with more than 500 people must be ISO 14001 certified within 2 years after their acquisition or creation. The scope of environmental reporting covers about 80% of the Group energy consumption).- estimating emissions from the use of our products, as our products consume electricity and dissipate heat (Joule effect) during use phase. Nevertheless, it is important to note that our products are part of larger electricity architectures, which lead to two essential considerations:-the energy consumed by our products is mostly negligible with respect to the architecture in which they are installed-the architecture often enables to deliver efficiency through energy management and automation (see more details in scope 3 target).This target is the Scope 1+2 part of our 1.5°C SBT.In 2019, we have recalculated our base year vehicle fleet emissions.  Updated Base Year (2017) emissions are: 698,162 tCO2e"

Emissions from use phase were estimated to about 60,000,000 tCO2, representing over 84% of scope 3 emissions.Nevertheless, our products are part of larger electricity architectures, which lead to two essential considerations:-the energy consumed by our products is mostly negligible with respect to the architecture in which they are installed-the architecture often enables to deliver efficiency through energy management and automation (see more details in scope 3 target).In addition, a vast majority of Schneider Electric's products have long lifecycles, from up to 40 years. This directly translates into high use-phase emissions, compared to other industries with shorter-lifespan products, such as consumer electronics. Looking solely at use-phase induced absolute emission therefore generates a strong biais in the evaluation of the sustainability performance of offers, as companies producing durable products are penalized compared to other sectors.This is why, it is important to account for the emissions in the use phase of our products and engage in their reduction, but it is absolutely essential to underline the role that they are playing in the decarbonization of the economy.Schneider Electric has launched a major innovation in 2018: reporting externally quarterly (in our Schneider Sustainability Impact) how much CO2 our solutions enable our customers to save. Our ambition was to save 120 MTCO2 from 2018 to 2020. In 2018, we reported 51 Mt CO2 saved by our customers thanks to our products and we achieved to save 134 Mt CO2 end of 2020. The annual performance of this indicator is audited by an independent third party.In 2020, following complete external audit of our scope 3 emissions, we have updated our 2017 scope 3 emissions from 71,253,404 to 67,413,029"

"In FY 2019, we established a first time sustainability-related goal to reduce absolute GHG emissions from our recycling operations by 25% (target coverage represents approximately 80% of total company revenue) by the end of Fiscal Year 2025. In FY 2019, we began a multi-year, multi-site project to install enclosures and emission control systems on our shredders to improve air quality in the communities surrounding our shredders. We have to installed such emission control systems at one facility Massachusetts, with development underway for a facility in California, and planning underway for facilities in Washington, Oregon, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. Some of these new projects will include installation of thermal oxidizers to treat volatile organic compounds (VOCs). VOC treatment protects air quality by both reducing the potential for ozone formation and significantly decreasing GHG emissions. We have taken a leadership position within the metal shredding industry by properly quantifying air emissions associated with shredding operations and taking appropriate steps to reduce such emissions.Utilizing the Transition Pathway Initiative's (TPI) assessment of the Carbon Performance of steel makers (updated version published January 2021), we consider our target to be a science-based target as our current carbon intensity (scope 1+2) per metric ton of finished steel product produced was approximately 0.18 in FY 2020, well below the Below 2 Degree scenario of approximately 1.15 for 2025, and we have near-term intentions to have it submitted for review and approval by the  SBTi."

"SAIC recognizes the risks climate change poses to our environment, and we are committed to reducing our environmental footprint. As part of this commitment SAIC has taken active steps to measure, monitor, and track our GHG emissions (Scope 1 and Scope 2) at those facilities over which we have operational control, and to publicly disclose those emissions against our stated reduction goal. In addition, for its 2020 GHG Emissions Inventory, SAIC is pursuing independent assurance under the AA1000 Assurance Standard.As part of its 2019 GHG Emissions Inventory, 2019 became the new base year for GHG emissions. 2019 was chosen as the base year based upon significant changes in our real estate portfolio associated with the acquisition of Engility in January 2019. Having exceeded the previous emission reduction goal (i.e., 15% by 2025 over a 2014 base year), discussions on the establishment of a new GHG reduction goal are in progress. In compiling these GHG emissions, SAIC follows the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard. All 7 gases are included in the reported emissions. Calculations are performed utilizing a well-known industry reporting system that references eGRID GHG references for electricity. Base year 2019 Scope 1 emissions were approximately 823 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents.2020 Scope 1 emissions were approximately 611 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents, or approximately 25% below the 2019 base year."

"Sempra has set a goal to reduce fugitive methane emissions from natural gas transmission and distribution systems by 40% from a 2015 baseline* by 2030. The target includes the following businesses :  SoCalGas, SDG&E and IEnova (Ecogas utility and other IEnova-owned natural gas pipelines).In 2020, SoCalGas and SDG&E were able to achieve a 19.7% and 9%** reduction of fugitive emissions over the baseline, respectively, and a total reduction of 18,577 metric tons of CO2e from 2020 to 2019 (SDG&E and SoCalGas).  The goal is expected to be achieved primarily through  working to improve the efficiency of the transmission system to reduce fugitive methane emissions; and by working to improve fugitive emission review, detection, and repairing activities as part of the asset maintenance plan.  *The baseline year used by SDG&E and SoCalGas is 2015, while IEnova selected 2019 as the baseline year (2019 emissions are higher). **Based on the current CPUC reporting templates, SoCalGas' current emissions reduction from the 2015 official baseline is 35%, while SDG&E's is 39.6%; the reporting templates do not take into account any reporting changes since 2015, such as using company-specific Emissions Factors, Leaker-Based estimation methodology, and template changes. The Emissions Strategy Team will work with the CPUC over the summer to work towards implementing these adjustments. Please note once all proposed adjustments are accepted by the CPUC, we expect SoCalGas' and SDG&E's emissions reductions from the 2015 official adjusted baseline to be approximately 19.7% and 9%, respectively.Sempra's corporate sustainability team along with the operating companies' sustainability steering committees are exploring the feasibility of setting a science- based target."
"Interim target:  We aim to reduce our California utility and Mexico (non-LNG) operational GHG emissions by 50% compared to a 2019 baseline by 2030. This target excludes Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions related to our LNG operations. We have set an annual intensity target for LNG related emissions, which is discussed in 4.1b below.

"Target: We aim to achieve net-zero scope 1, scope 2 and scope 3 GHG emissions by 2050. Sempra understands that being a leader in climate change includes measuring and reducing emissions across the energy value chain. That is why we are committed to the goal of achieving net-zero GHG emissions across all scopes by 2050. For two decades, the Sempra family of companies has been on a sustained path to decarbonize our business operations and the markets we serve with a view towards transitioning to net-zero – where we emit no more greenhouse gases than we remove from the atmosphere. Accomplishing this goal by 2050 will do our part to aid in keeping global warming below a 1.5-2 degree Celsius change. While innovation and new technologies will be central to society's net-zero goal by 2050, we expect that investing in three key capabilities is needed: decarbonization, diversification and digitalization. Fully addressing climate change will require reducing all GHG emissions. We will also explore the opportunities we may have in the offset and environmental credit markets. As the Sempra family of companies develop and promote new capabilities in decarbonization, diversification and digitalization, it will help drive our ESG commitments to support long-term, sustainable value for all shareholders and our other stakeholders."

"Switzerland is the only site with relevant scope 1 greenhouse gas emission (heating with gas, emission of HFCs and SF6).So we have the KPI to reduce these greenhouse gases 5% per year and produced unit."
"In 2018/19 we were supported by a specialist  Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) approved consultancy to agree the appropriate methodology (absolute emissions contraction), target ambition level and base year for our emission targets.  Based on this guidance we set 2019 as our new base year and  set the following company-wide targets:- Scope 1&2 absolute reduction of 6% based on 2019 by 2020 (market based)- Scope 1&2 absolute reduction of 22% based on 2019 by 2025  (market based)- Scope 1&2 absolute reduction of 38% based on 2019 by 2030  (market based)These are aligned to a net zero trajectory by 2050 and will be reviewed regularly.  They have not yet been submitted to the SBT initiative however this will remain under review.  For some sectors / industries, separate sector-specific methodologies, frameworks and requirements have been / are being developed by SBTi.  SBTi are currently developing science-based target setting methods, tools and guidance for shipping and aviation companies.  This will affect Serco given we operate marine transport.  Furthermore, at the request of one of our main and longest-standing clients, we are in the process of reviewing our reporting boundary, recognising that there is a level of double reporting of emissions and challenge in meeting our net zero targets given we mainly operate on customer assets and sites.  We will therefore be reviewing our targets in 2022."

We measure and analyze emissions based on gas emissions by km traveled.
In 2020 we committed to reach 100% renewable energy by the end of 2021 for office and datacenter operations.
"In 2020 we committed to achieve carbon neutrality by the end of 2021 across our office and datacenter operations, and corporate travel."
"In 2021, we'll set our target year to achieve net zero carbon in accordance with SBTi.  We'll use 2019 as our baseline year and commit to a much more aggressive schedule than the 2050 timeline set by the Paris Agreement. In 2020,  we conducted greenhouse gas (GHG) inventory validation work, including the in-depth Scope 3 baseline assessment, which will inform our future net zero efforts across our value chain. We also began structuring our cross-functional efforts internally to ensure our business is aligned for the long-term success of our net zero efforts."
"Target to reduce CO2 emissions from store operation of main 13 operating companies.In 2020, the 2050 target was raised (net-zero emissions by 2050). In 2021, the 2030 was raised (reduce carbon emissions to 50% of the 2013 level by 2030)."

Severfield have set a 5 year target to reduce the scope 1 and 2 emissions by 25.2% with a 2019 baseline. Whilst it appears we have already made good progress on this target Severfield have recently purchased another business which will be incorporated into this target and production is set to increase over the next few years. The target is considered in line with science as it follows the methodology of the SBTi in not allowing global temperatures to increase by more than 1.5 degrees.
Severfield have set an ambitious target of reaching Net Zero carbon in our scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2040 with a baseline year of 2018/19.  This will cover all locations within the scope of GHG protocol reporting. This is a long term target in tandem with our new 5 year medium term target of reducing our scope 1 and 2 emissions by 25.2% in line with scientific evidence to aim to ensure global warming does not increase by more than 1.5 degrees.
This is our science-based target reduction trajectory - we have now submitted our science based targets for verification by the SBTi.
"Our ambitions 2025 translate into a reduction in absolute reduction in emissions by 24.14% considering a baseline year of 2014. Our 2020 CO2 emissions of  122,952 tons corresponds to a 176.3% achievement level of this target. This target covers our Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 (business travel)."
"Our ambitions 2030 translate into a reduction in absolute reduction in emissions by 29.8% considering a baseline year of 2014. Our 2020 CO2 emissions of  122,952 tons corresponds to a 142.9% achievement level of this target. This target covers our Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3.6 (business travel)."
"We minimize the use of fuel cars to reduce the carbon emissions from fuel burning. We can contact the customer by phone or by public transportation to meet customer. We plan to reduce emissions by 20% in 5 years. This is the 4th year of implementation. In 2017 and 2020, we reduced 2 fuel business cars, which enabled us to speed up the reduction. We will achieve our target in 2021."
We are a trading company. There is no electricity for production. Only office areas use electricity including Scope 2. We save energy in the office area by using LED lights and setting 26 degrees of air conditioning in summer. We plan to reduce emissions by 10% in 9 years. This is the 4th year of implementation.
"This is a long-term target. We are a trading company. Emissions are mainly concentrated in Scope 3. In downstream activities, we can enable customers to purchase energy-saving equipment through sales and agency to save energy. We launched the cooling water system project in 2017 and the RTO equipment project and rooftop solar power equipment project in 2018. These plans are going very well at the present. In 2019, we launched another compressed air equipment renovation project.  At least one energy-saving project every year, maintain a leading level in the industry."
"On business trips, we use as low-energy trains as possible to replace fuel cars or airplanes. We plan to reduce emissions by 4% per year for the next 4 years. According to data released by CACC (Civil Aviation Administration of China): the energy consumption of high-speed train is about 10% of the airplane and 20% of the cars. It is obviously a relatively low-emission mode of transportation. This is the 4th year of implementation. We will put forward higher requirements by 2021."
"Encourage employees to use public transportation instead of private cars. We plan to reduce emissions by 5% total for the next 4 years. On September 22, 2017, the Board took the lead in organizing car-free day activities within our company to guide more employees to pay attention to and choose low-energy, low-pollution and low-emission transportation modes. Advocate the concept of green ecological life. And organize employees to participate in the signing activities. This is the 4th year of implementation. We will formulate a new plan in 2021 and invite more employees to participate."

"As the Company  has more than 1600 equipments , it uses extensive amount of energy, especially production machines and air conditioners usage. Electricity is the major energy resource in the Company's operations. Therefore, the majority of its energy saving projects focus on reducing its electricity consumption.We have formulated policies and guidelines related to the environmental management, including energy management. For example, energy saving lighting system (LED light) are used at factory.  Equipment department purchases energy saving rating machinery to replace old machine.  In our office, all service desktops have set to hibernate mode when the desktop machines are unused for more than 30 minutes. Cooling system in the factory and office have been upgraded by using environmentally friendly refrigerant and the temperature is set to 26ºC during summer. The thermostat is set to the highest acceptable temperature to save electricity. Since the implementation of such initiatives, Tatfook Technology managed to lower its electricity consumption accordingly."
This target was set in 2018 and has been endorsed by SBTi.Boundaries are Shimizu Corporation and affiliated companies (including overseas subsidiaries) described in our securities report.
"This target was set in 2018 and has been endorsed by SBTi.This emission has already reached the SBT target, but we will continue to set this target in the future. The reason is that the buildings designed by us in fiscal 2020 were used in many offices where it was easy to reduce CO2 emissions.However, if this trend continues, we will change the target to WB2D."

"During covid-19 company was under shutdown, so could not work and less production. So we set the target in 2020, base year is 2018 for 10 years. We took target in 2021 to reduce 10% within these 10 years."
"Shoprite's absolute Scope 1 and 2 emissions increased significantly in the 2019/2020 reporting scope due to increasing the scope from Rand-based operations (i.e. South Africa, Lesotho, e-Swatini and Namibia) to company-wide operations (i.e. South Africa, Lesotho, e-Swatini, Namibia, Angola, Botswana, DRC, Ghana, Kenya, Madagascar, Malawi, Mozambique, Nigeria, Uganda and Zambia) and the reported overall facility square meterage also increased significantly. As the 2019/2020 reporting scope was Shoprite's company-wide operations, the 2019/2020 financial year (1 July 2019 - 30 June 2020) is used as the base year.Shoprite has signed up for science-based targets with a target ambition of 1.5°C aligned."
"Target for 2030 is 3370kt-CO2. Actual emission for 2020 was 3388kt-CO2.  This amount is 402kt-CO2 less than that for 2013, which is the base year.  Thus we achieved 97% of target reduction.This target is based on the guideline in the Execution Plan to Realize Low Carbon Society announced by Japan Chemical Industry Association, assuming that our GHG emission in 2030 should be decreased by 10.7% from the level in 2013.  And we set our corporate group's target for its domestic CO2 emission as the sum of Scope 1 and 2.  As for the setting of SBT, for our company which is in the chemical sector, the discharge of Scope 3 especially during use of products is prominent, and it is difficult to set up our SBT target. We will continue to consider it."
"We could have achieved 100% of the target, but because the company can only reach 78.7% for some policy reasons."

"This target was set in 2018. This target is made up of all Sibanye-Stillwater operations at the time. The bulk of the emissions is from the operations in South Africa, comprising more than 95%. The SA national emissions trajectory, the sectoral decarbonisation approach methodology and the CDP criteria of 2.1% reduction have been considered in setting this target. This target has been sent to the Science-based targets initiative for review and was approved on 26 March 2019. The SA operations scope 2 emissions is made up of emissions from purchased electricity from Eskom and purchased electricity from Aggreko who own and operate the electricity generators at Beatrix Mine. These generators use methane extracted from the mine as its fuel source. As Beatrix exercises a choice in its electricity purchases, the market-based method is applicable. All the other SA operations electricity is location-based.  The US operations electricity is also purchased from more than one source (market-based). According to the GHG protocol, if a multi-regional company has any operations within the corporate inventory where the market-based method applies, then a market-based method total shall be calculated for the entire corporate inventory to ensure completeness and consistency. For any individual operations in the corporate inventory where market based method data on the hierarchy is not applicable or available, data from the location-based method should be used to represent the emissions from the facility. For these operations, the calculated scope 2 according to the market-based method will be identical to the location-based.Sibanye acquired the Marikana operations (ex Lonmin) in the previous reporting year. A restatement of the base year and the target is still to be undertaken to include these operations.When comparing the target to the base year and excluding the Marikana Lonmin operations, Sibanye has achieved a 29% reduction in their Scope 1 and 2 emissions therefore the target has been achieved."
"To address Sidel Group's scope 1+2 emissions, one target has been set. The proposed target intends to reduce absolute emissions 30% by 2030 from a 2019 base year, and is modelled using the absolute Contraction approach. The chart compares the target against two long term Absolute Contraction temperature pathways. The ambition of the proposed scope 1 and 2 target exceeds the minimum ambition for the well-below 2°C pathway in the target year of 2030 and is therefore considered ambitious. Using the Absolute Contraction Approach, the targets covering scope 1+2 emissions are classified as well-below 2°C aligned."

"To address our own operations, we launched our Carbon Neutral Program in September 2015. Based on a positive business case, we have more than halved the footprint from our own operations (Scope 1+2) by 2020 and are working towards being carbon neutral by 2030 (baseline fiscal year 2014, 2,180,000 t as reported).  The CO2 reduction will be achieved through a series of ongoing activities in 4 levers: 1. Energy Efficiency Program – Our investments in energy efficiency projects led to a 15% reduction of energy costs 2. Distributed Energy Systems - We are creating showcases of distributed energy systems at our own sites (e.g. combining power generation, such as wind, PV with storage solutions etc.) 3. Car Fleet - Our car fleet (about 50,000 vehicles) is included in our CO2-neutral aspiration. We will continue to include CO2 emission factors as an integral part of our local car fleet policies around the world 4. Green Electricity: We are changing our power purchasing guidelines and move towards a significantly cleaner power mix with a focus on renewable energies and gas. Company-wide, green electricity covered more than 70 % of our electricity needs in fiscal year 2020.  We have achieved our interim target 2020 of 50% reduction without offsetting carbon emissions.  As we focus on domestic measures to reduce our carbon footprint, it is too early to estimate to what extent carbon offsets will be needed beyond 2020.  By beginning of 2021, our set of targets has been extended to the complete value chain and approved by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). As part of our 2021 verified SBTi target, we commit to reduce absolute scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions 50% by 2030 from a 2019 base year. Siemens AG also commits to reduce absolute scope 3 GHG emissions 15% by 2030 from a 2019 base year. The targets are consistent with reductions required to keep warming to 1.5°C.We consider our Carbon Neutral Program as a long-term target as we will remain carbon neutral post 2030. According to the CDP definition of a long-term target (post 2035), this target translates into a separate long-term absolute target – see next line. We do not consider intensity targets (i.e. emission figures that have been normalized to a business metric when compared to the same normalized business metric emissions in a base year) as we have ambitious absolute targets."
"In fiscal year 2021, Siemens joined the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). To limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, we commit to a science-based reduction pathway along our entire value chain. In this way, we're ensuring that our climate-protection efforts are in harmony with the Paris Climate Agreement's highest level of ambition.In doing so, the company is pursuing the science-based pathway to reduction that the SBTi advocates. Within the framework of this initiative, we're also part of a worldwide community of companies that share the same values and goals.By 2030, we intend to achieve a 20%-reduction in our global supply chain's emissions based on 2020 emissions of 8,100,000 metric tons of CO2 (excluding Siemens Healthineers). Due to the carve out of Siemens Healthineers, the baseline for this target is not 10,200,000 metric tons of CO2 (as reported in fiscal year 2020; including Siemens Healthineers).As part of our decarbonization program, we already publish data on the upstream greenhouse-gas emissions produced by our suppliers. Siemens has some 65,000 suppliers worldwide. Since 2019, we've been working intensively on a process for determining our carbon footprint and for reducing emissions by establishing individual target agreements. By beginning of 2021, our set of targets has been extended to the complete value chain and approved by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi).As part of our 2021 verified SBTi target, we commit to reduce absolute scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions 50% by 2030 from a 2019 base year. Siemens AG also commits to reduce absolute scope 3 GHG emissions 15% by 2030 from a 2019 base year. The targets are consistent with reductions required to keep warming to 1.5°C. As part of our long-term targets, we aim to achieve an emission-free supply chain by the year 2050."
"Also in the decades beyond 2030, we intend to support our customers with our low carbon technologies and to reduce our own footprint to contribute to the decarbonization of the global economy. Post 2030 (target year 2050) we will remain carbon neutral and will continue to utilize the same levers to manage our CO2 emissions through initiatives to increase energy efficiency, new models of distributed energy systems, increased incentives and models to reduce emissions of the car fleet and an increase in the purchase of green electricity to move towards a cleaner power mix. As explained above, we have achieved our interim target of 50% reduction by 2020  without offsetting carbon emissions. As we focus on domestic measures to reduce our carbon footprint, it is too early to estimate to what extent carbon offsets will be needed beyond 2020 and 2030 until 2050. Therefore, at the current phase of implementation, we are not yet able to make a quantitative assessment. By beginning of 2021, our set of targets has been extended to the complete value chain and approved by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi).As part of our 2021 verified SBTi target, we commit to reduce absolute scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions 50% by 2030 from a 2019 base year.

As we focus on domestic measures to reduce our carbon footprint, it is too early to estimate to what extent carbon offsets will be needed beyond 2020.  We consider our Carbon Neutral Program as a long-term target as we will remain carbon neutral post 2030. According to the CDP definition of a long-term target (post 2035), this target translates into a separate long-term absolute target – see Abs3. We do not consider intensity targets (i.e. emission figures  normalized to a business metric when compared to the same normalized business metric emissions in a base year) as we have ambitious absolute targets. By beginning of 2021, our set of targets has been extended to the complete value chain and approved by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). As part of our 2021 verified SBTi target, we commit to reduce absolute scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions 50% by 2030 from a 2019 base year. Siemens AG also commits to reduce absolute scope 3 GHG emissions 15% by 2030 from a 2019 base year. The targets are consistent with reductions required to keep warming to 1.5°C."

"As part of our Brighter Lives, Better World program, Signify has set the target to reduce absolute emissions from scope 1 + 2 combined (market-based) with 70% by 2030 against baseline year 2015. This target was officially approved by the Science Based Targets initiative and deemed in line with the ambition to limit global warming below 1.5 degrees. This target will in part be achieved by improving the environmental performance of manufacturing and office facilities with relation to climate change, water, and waste and chemical substances. Signify, is a member of the RE100, a collaborative initiative of influential businesses committed to 100 percent renewable electricity. Over the last few years (2015-2020), Signify has increased its use of renewable energy from 56 percent to 100 percent. By using renewable energy, we further reduced scope 2 carbon footprint by over 9,000 metric tons, which is 95% of our total scope 2 (market based) emissions. The additional scope 2 emissions (5%) are resulting from purchased heat, and steam. In the same period, 2015 - 2020, scope 1 emissions have reduced about 60,000 metric tons which was largely achieved by continuous improvement of energy efficiency and reducing use of natural gas by more than 23%.It is worth mentioning that 2020 emissions levels were generally lower than expected due to the impact of COVID-19 pandemic."
"As part of our Brighter Lives, Better World program, Signify has set the target to reduce absolute emissions from scope 3 use of products sold with 30% by 2030 against baseline year 2015. This target was officially approved by the Science Based Targets initiative and deemed in line with limiting global warming below 2 degrees. We are awaiting confirmation of alignment with a below 1.5 degrees ambition.  More than 95% of our total scope 3 emissions come from the use of sold products. The only way to achieve this target is to improve the average energy efficiency of our portfolio faster than the company growth rate. Furthermore, we see our portfolio shifting towards LED-based lighting. LED lighting is more energy efficient, however its longer lifetime also implies higher absolute scope 3 emissions. Additionally, towards 2030 the biggest growth will come from professional systems and services, which typically have a bigger installed capacity, again leading to higher absolute scope 3 emissions. It is worth mentioning that 2020 emissions levels were generally lower than expected due to the impact of COVID-19 pandemic."
"After achieving carbon neutral and 100% renewable electricity in our global operations in 2020, we launched even more ambitious goals. With the United Nations´ Sustainable Development Goals as our strategic compass we commit to double our positive impact on the environment and society in the next five years.In the space of climate action, we will double the pace of the Paris Agreement by the end of 2025.  As part of our commitment to climate action (SDG 13) and affordable and clean energy (SDG 7), we will go beyond carbon neutrality and double the pace of the Paris Agreement 1.5°C scenario. We will reach the 2031 pathway/target in 2025 by increasing the energy efficiency of our portfolio to reduce emissions of our customers and driving carbon reductions at our suppliers."
We will re-set our goals to include scope 3 within 2 years.
The target covers scope 1+2 emissions on all production sites. After 5 of 15 years the is already achieved by 53%.

"A meta foi definida abrangendo emissões de escopo 1 e escopo 2 das empresas do Grupo (JSL, Movida, CS Brasil, Original e Vamos). Ela foi definida pelo comitê de sustentabilidade, após estudos e implementação de novos projetos, como projeto de energia renovável, frota elétrica (CS Brasil) e instalação de telemetria. Neste ano, estamos contando com o apoio de uma consultoria especializada para  estabelecer metas seguindo os princípios do SBTI."
"The data collected covers 100% of our sites scope 1 and 2 emissions instead of just the top sites scope 1 and 2 emissions as done in  the years prior to FY20. As prior years are no longer comparable to FY20 on wards we set a science based target using FY20 as the base year. The target is 1.5 degrees aligned. Our target of a 23% absolute emissions reduction by 2025 (scope 1 and 2 emissions) is linked to our target to achieve net zero by 2050 (scope 1 and 2 emissions). The target is currently not approved by the Science-Based Targets initiative. As our scope 3 emissions compose over 40% of the total scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions we are in the process of developing a scope 3 target. We aim to finalise the scope 3 target by the end of the 2021 calendar year. Once we have set a scope 3 target we will get our targets verified by the Science-Based Targets initiative.  Emissions increased compared to prior year inline with  increased tonnage of materials processed."

"This years questionaire's data considers now the five years planning and target. Please take into account that the huge reduction which was achieved last year is based on a travel ban within siticom and Germany at all, due to COVID-19 pandemic measures. We would like to introduce a per-employee-rate of the CO2-scopes, as it would make more sense for us as a people-driven know-how organization to evaluate that. To understand this, you have to consider the fact, that our IT-consultants are in most cases travelling to customers for their consultancy. That means for a growing organization in terms of people that more people means more travelling means more CO2. And that is our challange to reduce CO2 while growing with IT-consultancy (more digital collaboration planned)."

"In order to reduce Scope 1 in the short term, we plan to improve energy efficiency by replacing outdated refrigerators/compressors, optimizing process operation and improving power systems. FEMS (Factory Energy Management System), which is being applied to Suwon and Jincheon plants, will be expanded to all business sites. In order to reduce Scope 2, we plan to implement as much as possible through available domestic measures such as the green premium plan, purchased in 2021. For overseas sites, we plan to build RE100 implementation sites from the beginning of operation like the Malaysian copper foil plant, scheduled to be completed in 2023."
"In the mid- to long-term, the application of low-carbon hydrogen and biofuels will be promoted to reduce Scope 1 emission and carbon capture technology will also be considered. To reduce Sope 2 emission, overseas new & expansion sites are scheduled to build full RE100 implementation sites like SK nexilis' Malaysia plant, which is scheduled to be completed in 2023. SK picglobal and SKC HT&M which are both subsidiaries of SKC, have purchased a green premium plan this year. In addition, SKC plans to actively introduce possible options such as a third-party PPA. These plans will also be aligned with the Climate Group's RE100 Declaration and Implementation Plan, which SKC joined in Dec 2020."
"In June of 2020, SKF announced its target to achieve Carbon Neutrality for all its manufacturing operations, warehouses and R&D facilities by 2030. This covers all scope 1 and 2 emissions. We consider this a science-based target and in 2021 SKF signed up to the SBTI 1.5 degree commitment so  this and all other relevant targets will be verified by SBTI.Defining targets which meet the SBTI requirements for scope 1 and 2 emissions and upstream Scope 3  is relatively simple. . Down-stream he Scope 3 emissions resulting from customer use of our products is more challengingSKF can significantly reduce direct customer emissions in a number of ways such as;•providing products, solutions which help to enable cleantech industries such as renewable energy •optimizing SKF products and / or customer systems – providing lower weight or lower friction SKF products or helping the customer to design more energy and carbon efficient systems. •applying Rotating Equipment Performance contracts that avoid energy and carbon waste.From (LCA) and Carbon Footprint studies on our products and solutions over the years and from these we know that the ghg reductions achieved with these approaches are typically many times greater than  our own operations and upstream.However, to quantify and aggregate these savings as well as the emissions associated with the normal running our products across more than 40 globalized industries in a meaningful way is extremely challenging. This is due to the nature of the SKF product offering and our position in the value chain. The same SKF product can typically be applied in multiple different applications. Each application has potentially very different energy use and associated greenhouse gas impacts.On top of this, a large percentage of SKF's products are sold via our globalized distributor network – and very often it is not possible for us to know where the product is applied (which customer, which industry).This is why  we are yet to issue a simple downstream scope 3  target. We are working with the SBTI and others to find meaningful goals that will focus on and drive SKF's ability to enable dramatic reductions in customer and end user emissions and which meet the SBTI requirements."
By 2021 the target has been revisited and the target has been set to 2030. Target to 2030 is also including scope 3 areas and an absolute target of Co2 reduction with 50% to 2030. The target also includes that Scope 1 and 2 should have net-zero emission by 2030.
The target coverage is Republic of Korea.
"The target coverage is 100% of Scopes 1,2 and 3 across our global operations."
"We have committed through the Fashion Industry Charter for Climate Action to achieve a 30 per cent aggregate GHG emission reductions in scope 1, 2 and 3 of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Standard by 2030, against a baseline of no earlier than 2015.  SLN's base year for this goal is 2016. According to the CF Report in 2016, the carbon emission of SLN is 9471 tCO2e (Scope 1&2) and the carbon emission of SLN in 2020 is: 10884 tCO2e (Scope 1,2 &3)  and 10586 tCO2e (Scope 1&2)"
"In the year 2016 we decided to purchase ""green"" electricity from renewable sources.  We plan  to purchase ""green"" electricity till 2022 but we would like to continue to do so also after the target year.In Scope 2 a change of methodology in calculation of emission occurred.  Not only direct emission but also WTT (well-to-tank) losses are calculated in this section. It is related to a change in the standard ISO 14064-1:2018. Thus a sum of Scope 2 emission is not zero as it was last year."
Only GHG emissions from natural gas consumption are involved in the target (98% of all Scope 1 emissions).  Originally the target was 23% reduction against 2015 reference number.  As we have already reached this target we considered to change it to 30% reduction.
Only paper purchase is considered. It represents majority of Scope 3 emissions (more than 70%). Comparing to the base year 2016 there is a 12% rise of paper consumption in the year 2020.  We will review this target to take a rise of paper consumption into account in 2021.
This is a new target. A new target was set because the old one (Abs 2) was achieved in 2020.
"STRATEGYOur Net Zero 2030 target is highly ambitious and utilises the Institute of Environmental Management and Assessment (IEMA) carbon reduction hierarchy; Avoid, Reduce, Substitute, Compensate, and based first on foremost on genuine operational change.This target is underpinned with strong strategic and financial plans for our key scope 1 and 2 emissions sources; Fleet and Buildings.EMISSIONS FOCUSWe will be taking radical steps to avoid and reduce emissions utilising innovative processes and systems, for example through the fleet scheduling software recently implemented. We will be looking to substitute fossil fuels in both our fleet vehicles and building energy sources.We have already taken strides in our fleet vehicles, with all company cars now transitioned to Hybrid vehicles.TIMESCALEWe have been highly ambitious with our 2030 timescale, which reflects our commitment to transitioning to the low carbon economy needed to ensure a sustainable world."
"We have achieved the target from a baseline of 2016, this was replaced in 2020 with longer term targets (hence a new baseline) so this was reported against the original target year of 2020 as published, to maintain or exceed a 10% reduction in emissions.  In our final year we achieved a 20.9% absolute reduction from 92,237t to 72,945 (target 209% achieved).  This will need to be maintained and closely monitored.In 2020, we ended this target and launched a new strategy starting in 2020 with new targets. These will be reported from 2021 in CDP and our external reports."
We are in the process of collecting baseline year and subsequent year data to quantify progress.  We pledged our commitment to SBTi in 2021 and are in the process of target submission and validation.
"In 2003, the Board directed SMUD to set a GHG reduction target. This target, known as Strategic Direction (SD) – 9, was adopted on May 6, 2004. The goal has been revised several times to add more detail and refinement. In December 2008, the Board added sustainable power supply as the overall objective of the integrated resource planning process. It stated the goal of reducing SMUD's long-term greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) from generation of electricity for serving our retail load to 10% of its 1990 GHG emission levels by 2050 (i.e. - <350,000 metric tons/year). Subsequently in May 2011, the Board added interim GHG targets for years 2012 and 2020, to establish a trend toward long-term GHG goals, and clarification for alternatives to achieve targets and goals. As a note, this target is set using the net greenhouse gas emissions and to provide stability is adjusted for normal wind and hydro production."
"The Board adopted this target through Resolution 18-10-11 as part of SMUD's Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) on October 18, 2018. This is an interim target on SMUD's pathway to reduce carbon emissions to net zero in 2040. The target assumes that SMUD's portfolio is comprised of 60% renewables by the end of 2030 and that interim targets as specified in SB-100 are met."
"In late 2020 SMUD began planning an ambitious goal of delivering carbon neutral electricity in the next decade, creating our 2030 Clean Energy Vision (CEV). To meet our bold CEV goal, SMUD's 2030 Zero Carbon Plan was recently approved, bringing our one-SMUD approach to the forefront of our low-carbon transition commitments; the Plan involved months of Board-level meetings, committee discussions with industry experts, public comments to engage with our stakeholders, and collaborating with our regional partners on how to best achieve our zero-carbon goal."

"Snam increased its commitment to reduce natural gas emissions by 45% in 2025, compared with 2015 figures and assuming a like for like basis (last year was 40% by 2025 vs. 2016). The target was increased and aligned with the UN OGMP 2.0 framework and is part of Company's Net-Zero Strategy."
"Snam is committed to reduce scope 1 and 2 emissions by 50% in 2030, compared with 2018 figures."
"With its Net Zero Carbon strategy, Snam envisages concrete actions and significant investments for a gradual reduction in direct and indirect energy emissions of Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gases, in line with the commitments defined in the Paris Agreement to limit the rise in global temperature to no more than 1.5°C, until carbon neutrality is achieved in 2040."
We have committed to reducing absolute scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions 25% by 2025 from a 2019 base year. This target is consistent with reductions required to keep warming to 1.5°C and has been approved by the Science-Based Targets initiative.
"In early 2021, SNC-Lavalin released its targets and objectives set to reach Net Zero carbon emissions by 2030 (Please see our publicly available document at: https://www.snclavalin.com/~/media/Files/S/SNC-Lavalin/download-centre/en/policy/net-zero-carbon-routemap.pdf)As stated in this document, SNC-Lavalin will be driving down its scope 1 emissions via divestments from energy intensive locations and activities, rationalizing office spaces and taking advantage of new infrastructure and regulations. In many jurisdictions, the latter will effectively ban the sale of fossil-fuel powered combustion engine vehicles as well as encourage the decommissioning of boilers and natural gas heaters in buildings, two of SNC-Lavalin's important sources of emissions.It is forecasted that, by 2030, these initiatives combined will lead to the reduction of about 94% of our scope 1 emissions compared to our 2019 base year. These reductions will be equivalent to avoiding emitting more than 52,000 tons of CO2 per year compared to the status quo.SNC-Lavalin's scope 1 emissions include: gas or other fuels used to operate buildings and facilities; purchased fuels for vehicles and equipment and; to a lesser extent of fugitive emissions of refrigerants."

These reductions will be equivalent to avoiding emitting more than 15,000 tons of CO2 per year compared to the status quo.Although SNC-Lavalin seemingly have already achieved its target for scope 2, we did not change the status of the target  to ""completed"" as methodology changes shifted part of our emissions to scope 3 (as explained further into this report) and we cannot exclude that scope 2 emissions will go up again once the covid-19 pandemic is over and employees are allowed back into their respective offices.  SNC-Lavalin's scope 2 emissions are entirely composed of electricity to operate buildings and facilities."

"Sodexo has set a target, approved as science-based by the Science-Based Target Initiative, to reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions 34% by 2025 from a 2017 base year that covers 100% of Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions.The reported value concerns the period from June 1st, 2019 to May 31st 2020, i.e. fiscal year 2020."
"In 2017, Sodexo had already realized significant Scope 1 and Scope 2 carbon emissions reductions. The ability to improve environmental outcomes through the reduction of Scope 3 emissions is far greater however, as these represent most of our carbon footprint.  Therefore, during 2018 and 2019 Sodexo developed a revised emissions calculation methodology for supply chain emissions, established a comprehensive Scope 3 inventory and baseline and reviewed its carbon reduction target.  This culminated in Sodexo submitting its target in line with the latest climate science and the 1.5?C pathway for official validation by the Science-Based Target initiative (SBTi) in May 2019. Sodexo has also become a RE100 member in March 2021.This new target, approved as science-based by the Science-Based Target Initiative is to reduce absolute Scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions 34% by 2025 from a 2017 base year that covers 100% of Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions and 78% of Scope 3 emissions (upstream + downstream).The target covers 78% of Scope 3 emissions as it only includes Food Services, which represent 70% of On Site Service Activity, and relevant client sites that represent 90% of Sodexo's total activity.The reported value concerns the period from June 1st, 2019 to May 31st 2020, i.e. fiscal year 2020."
"The coverage of the target is the entire business. Having achieved the first stage in our carbon reduction plan, which was for Softcat to become ‘Carbon Net Zero' offsetting any carbon usage with an agreed form of carbon offset, this target relates to the next step, which is based on renewable energy. In stage 2, Softcat will migrate to using 'renewable energy' across all of its office locations, reducing its overall GHG emissions. Our final stage is to have a carbon ‘Net Zero' supply chain by 2040, where all of our suppliers and partners will be ‘Carbon Net Zero'."

"In terms of science-based targets (SBT), while an annual reduction in thermal coal assets of 2.5% or more is necessary to achieve the ''well below 2?” scenario, Sojitz has set its goal to reduce thermal coal assets to zero by 2050, with 2018 as the benchmark year. Sojitz aims to reduce assets by 3.125% annually over this 32-year period, exceeding SBT standards. The increase in our emissions between FY2018 and this reporting year is primarily due to an increase in our overall production volume."

"Solvay published in February 2020 a new 2030 sustainability program, Solvay One Planet, in line with Solvay's purpose published in 2019. An integral element of the Group's G.R.O.W. strategy, the plan is directly aligned with Solvay's purpose of bonding people, ideas and elements to reinvent progress.The plan outlines ten ambitious targets to drive progress across three key pillars: climate, resources and better life. To meet these goals, Solvay pledges to reallocate investments to promote sustainability within its portfolio, operations and workplace.''With Solvay One Planet, we are setting bolder objectives to solve key environmental and societal challenges through science and innovation,” says CEO Ilham Kadri. ''Beyond climate change, we will tackle resource scarcity and promote a better life. Together with our customers, we will create sustainable shared value for all.  This is Progress Beyond. This is G.R.O.W.”Solvay One Planet is inspired by the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It includes ten measurable commitments in three key focus areas, to be achieved by 2030, three of which focusing on Climate-related issues:Climate1.    Lowering greenhouse gas emissions worldwide. Solvay will double the rate at which it reduces emissions, with a goal of curbing greenhouse gas emissions by 26% and aligning its trajectory with the ''well below 2°C temperature increase” goal outlined in the 2015 Paris Agreement.2.    Eliminating the use of coal. Solvay will not build new coal-powered plants and commits to phase out coal usage in energy production wherever renewable alternatives exist.All of Solvay's targets are company wide, with a scope consistent with the way sales are reported.In addition, Solvay has raised its sustainability ambition one step further and committed in October 2020 to review its 2030 objectives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in line with the Science Based Targets initiative.Solvay will further reduce emissions from its own factories (Scope 1) as well as emissions related to the energy it purchases (Scope 2). The new targets will also include emissions in the value chains connected to Solvay's activities. These emissions (Scope 3) are principally embedded in goods and services purchased and emissions taking place during  the processing, use and end of life of products sold."

"Sonata follows financial year for reporting and thus, the target year in here refers to the 'April to March' cycle. Sonata wants to become carbon neutral by FY 2030. To achieve carbon neutrality, emissions reduction strategy will be implemented in a phase-wise approach. The first step was to implement energy efficiency activities and 30% of emissions reduction target (Scope 1+2) was set from the base year 2019. In the FY 2020, 20% of target was achieved and in FY 2021, the remaining 10% has been achieved which was set as a part of the voluntary reduction initiative at Organization level. Considering FY 2019 as the base year, we have set some achievable targets. The base year emission value was 6577 metric tons CO2 equivalent. In FY 2020, the emission value was 5122 metric tons CO2 equivalent which was 20% decrease from the base year. In FY 2021, there has been 61% reduction in emissions value which comes down to 2542 metric tons CO2 equivalent due to work from home scenario which led to a very low electricity consumption for all the offices. The 10% of the total percentage was achieved because of replacement of CFLs to LEDs as a second phase of the approach in the reporting year."

"This is our 10-year science-based target for all of our Scopes 1 and 2 emissions approved and validated by SBTi.  We expect to achieve this target by procuring more renewable energy and through emissions reduction activities.  The SBTi initially approved and validated this target (Target T1) at 21% in May 2017, when it was aligned to the limit of 2°C in the rise in global average temperatures.  In September 2019 the SBTi re-approved and re-validated the revised target of 42%, which is aligned to the limit of 1.5°C in the rise in global average temperatures.  It is this revised target that is now being reported.  The original target was reported in 2017, 2018 and 2019 with the same Target Reference Number. We have completed 5 years of the 10-year period (50% of time completed) and are ahead of our target, having already achieved 94.5% of the required emission reduction against a pro-rata target of 50% for the 5 years.  These figures are consistent with the approach to accommodating acquisitions in absolute reduction targets described in the attachment (""Accommodating acquisitions in absolute emissions reduction targets.pdf"") in Section 3 of our submission to CDP 2017 Climate."

"This 6-year target for emissions that the company can directly influence (Scopes 1 and 2 of the GHG Protocol) was set when the new company was formed by the merger of Sopra and Steria in 2014.  We achieved this target within 2 years by procuring more renewable energy and through emissions reduction activities.  It was reported in 2017, 2018 and 2019 with the same Target Reference Number."
"This 6-year target for the largest source of emissions that the company can directly influence (Business Travel, Scope 3 Category 6 of the GHG Protocol) was set when the new company was formed by the merger of Sopra and Steria in 2014.  We achieved this target in the reporting year.  We achieved this target by continuing our switch to greener modes of travel and by leveraging remote working technology without compromising our commitments to our clients.   Covid-19 has had a significant impact to the target in a positive way.   We have revised the baseline to include acquisitions and Joint Venture companies that are now within the scope of our emissions figures.  We reported the target in 2017, 2018 and 2019 with the same Target Reference Number."
"One of our SBTi-approved science-based targets is ""Sopra Steria also commits that 70% of its suppliers by emissions will manage their GHG emissions and 90% of these suppliers will have GHG reduction targets by 2025.""Our approach to delivering this commitment is a phased programme with incremental milestones.1.Deliver an absolute reduction of 21% in supply chain emissions by the end of 2025 (base year 2018)2.During the period 2019-2023, evaluate the emissions of the following proportions of our suppliers accounting for 70% of our supply chain emissions: 40% in 2019; 60% in 2020; 80% in 2021; 100% by the end of 2022.Note that by 2019, the reporting year, we had exceeded the milestone target of 40% by evaluating the emissions of 50% of the suppliers accounting for 70% of our supply chain emissions.3.During the period 2020-2025, have the following proportions of suppliers accounting for 70% of our supply chain emissions managing their emissions: 30% in 2023; 65% in 2024; 100% by the end of 2025.4.During the period 2020-2025, have the following proportions of suppliers accounting for 70% of our supply chain emissions having emissions reductions targets in place: 20% in 2023, 45% in 2024; 90% by the end of 2025.We run supplier engagement programmes in countries where we have our biggest presence, engaging our suppliers using various communication and evaluation software platforms (EcoVadis, Provigis)."
"In July 2020, Southwire announced a goal to achieve 100% zero carbon energy for our operations by 2025 from a 2018 baseline. We will implement a Carbon Zero strategy to eliminate or offset all greenhouse gas (defined as carbon dioxide equivalents or carbon) associated with Scope 1 (direct combustion emissions) and Scope 2 (indirect emissions from purchased electricity) emissions.  Under Carbon Zero, Southwire intends to reach this milestone using approaches that may include some or all the following:- Reduction of on-site energy use through efficiency and modernization efforts- Installation of on-site renewable energy sources such as solar- The use of power purchase agreements (PPAs) for on-site renewable applications- The use of virtual power purchase agreements (VPPAs) for off-site renewable applications- The purchase of renewable energy certificates (RECs)- The purchase of renewable power from utility providers- The purchase of carbon offsets - Supporting the transition of our electricity and gas providers to low carbon energy sourcesWe have also set internal Scope 3 goals to achieve 50% reduction by 2030 and to be carbon neutral by 2050."

"This is a mid-term target covering Sparebanken Vest's Scope 1 and 2, and categories Waste and Business Travel in Scope 3. The target was set in 2018, with 2018 market based emissions as base year emissions. The annual reduction is -8,2 % from base year 2018, with a target of reaching 100 tCO2e in 2025.  This target can be considered a Science Based Target as it meets the ambition requirement criteria in line with a 1,5 degree target set by the Science Based Target initiative (SBTi). Note: in SPV's previous communication of the target, location-based emissions in base year 2018 of 293 tCO2e have been used, but we have here switched to market based emissions of 233 tCO2e for consistent methodology."
"This is a long-term target covering Sparebanken Vest's Scope 1 and 2, and categories Waste and Business Travel in Scope 3.

This target can be considered a Science Based Target as it meets the ambition requirement criteria in line with a well below 2 degree target set by the Science Based Target initiative (SBTi)."
We consider this a science based target in that the 5% reduction in reported emissions aligns with the 4.2% that SBTi would require. However we appreciate that we need to expand our Scope 3 reporting in order for it to truly be a science based target approved by SBTi. This process is underway.

SSAB has a science-based target (approved in 2020-08-24): ''SSAB commits to reduce absolute scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions 35% by 2032 from a 2018 base year.”The greenhouse gas emission reduction target(s) have been approved by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) and the scope 1 and 2 portion of the targets are aligned with a well-below 2°C pathway.
"This target covers: Direct GHG emissions (scope 1): GHG emissions from the consumption of oil, gas and biomass in SSE's thermal generation plant (including Power Purchase Agreements) to generate electricity, gas consumption in buildings, network and company vehicle fuel (petrol, diesel or gas oil) consumed and fugitive emissions (use of sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) in the transmission and distribution networks for conductivity (used in the switchgears and substations)); and Indirect GHG emissions (scope 2): GHG emissions from electricity consumption in buildings, networks and thermal power stations as well as distribution losses (this is the electricity lost in SSE's distribution network in the north of Scotland (SHEPD) and southern central England (SEPD) transporting electricity to the customer).Performance against the target: SSE's target is to reduce Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 40% by 2030, based on 2018 levels. In comparison to the baseline year of 2017/18, SSE's Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions fell by 31%.  The main contributing factors to this decrease included:• Emissions from electricity generation activities: emissions fell as a direct result of the decarbonisation of the fuels used to generate electricity. The main cause for the emissions decrease was the closure of Fiddler's Ferry. With the closure of its last remaining coal-fired power station, 2020/21 was the first year since 2005 that SSE's generation fleet contained no electricity output from coal.• Emissions from SSE's electricity and gas consumption: SSE's buildings and operations used less gas and electricity in comparison to the base year as a result of continued investments in energy efficiency measures combined with significantly lower emissions from electricity consumption as COVID-19 restrictions saw temporary closures of SSE's non-operational buildings. It is important to note that SSE does not expect the achievement of this target in 2030 to have followed a linear year-to-year reduction path. Market driven and weather-related fluctuations may mean there are some years in which emissions may increase. However, SSE fully expects to achieve its 2030 target and the long-term trend continues to be significant reduction in the absolute emissions from the electricity it generates.This target covers SSE's scope 1 and 2 emissions and is a science-based target, validated by the SBTi."
"This target covers: The indirect emissions (scope 3) use of sold products which relates to the ‘gas sold to customers by SSE'. This relates to the amount of gas sold to customers (industrial and commercial business customers in the UK and Ireland and domestic customers in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland) that is then used by our customers for heating and power purposes. This figure is calculated by taking the amount of gas sold (millions therms) converting it to kWh and then applying a carbon dioxide conversion factor provided by BEIS reporting guidelines.At present, SSE's scope 3 emissions are 40% or more of total scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions, and therefore a scope 3 target is required. SSE is involved in the sale and distribution of natural gas and so a scope 3 target for the use of sold products irrespective of the share of these emissions compared to the total scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions is applicable.SSE's gas sold target covers all the emissions in this category. The target also aligns to the ‘well below 2 degree' scenario and so is ambitious in its approach.Performance against the target: SSE's target is to reduce absolute GHG emissions from use of products sold by 50% by 2034 from a 2018 base year. This means that SSE's use of products sold is forecast to be around 1.3 million tonnes CO2e by 2030.SSE's Scope 3 GHG emissions decreased by nearly 7% between 2017/18 and 2020/21. It is important to note that SSE does not expect the achievement of this target in 2034 to have followed a linear year-to-year reduction path. Market driven and weather-related fluctuations may mean there are some years in which emissions may increase. However, SSE fully expects to achieve its 2034 target and the long-term trend continues to be to move to lower carbon sources of heat during this time period.This target covers SSE's scope 3 emissions and is a science-based target, validated by the SBTi.SSE has a suite of targets which together meet the SBTi criteria."
"The Group will increase its emission efficiency (ounces of gold / tonnes of CO2e) by 18.4% in 2030 versus a 2013 baseline year, and achieve carbon neutrality by 2050."

We are targeting net zero by 2050.
"The combination of energy efficiency, behavioural changes and electricity generated from renewable sources saw our electricity consumption reduce by 39% (30% reduction in carbon emissions), from 307 GWh (283 314 tCO2) in 2014 to 166 GWh (172 647 tCO2e) in 2020. This is significant progress towards our intended target of a 15% reduction and a demonstration of our commitment towards effectively managing our use of energy."
"Target for 2020 was 10% reduction in paper consumption. We achieved a substantial reduction from the base year. Paper reduction initiatives include 100% of our ATMs having a 'print slip' option. This has resulted in very large reduction of ATM slips paper usage.  We send client statements by email. Our paper-less branches program has yielded successes in reducing paper usage and this is ongoing. Our offices have a ""follow me"" printing initiative which helps manage in-office printing and resulted in a large reduction in our office paper usage in 2019-20. We also implemented paper usage awareness programs to encourage staff to be paper-wise when they print. From March 2020, over 75% of our employees have been working from home, drastically cutting down on in-office paper use."
"We are continuously improving our transition to a low-carbon economy, migrating from an energy intensity-based target calculation methodology to one that is carbon-based. We have tracked our South African Scope 1 and 2 emissions since 2010, as a member of CDP.  We also report some Scope 3 emissions for our South African operations  (which constitute the large majority of these emissions), together with water usage and waste in our direct operations in South Africa. We have piloted a method that caters for developing countries known as the equity method using local consultants. As a financial services provider our upstream scope 3 financing activities have data collection challenges and prevent the development of an SBTi approved target."
"We have committed to the SBTi. Currently only our scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions have been signed off as we wait for the scope 3 definitions to be closed. We have publicly communicated this in our Sustainability Aspirations (sc.com/sustainabilityaspirations). Because scope 3 methodology has not been finalised, we are unable to get approval from SBTi at this time but are an active contributor to the Science Based Targets for Financial Institutions (SBTi-FI) Expert Advisory Group in working to develop approved methodologies. Our work in this area is outlined in our  White Paper (http://sc.com/emissions).During 2020 the Bank made a commitment to become net zero in its operations by 2030. In 2019 we committed to becoming carbon neutral in our scope 1 and 2 emissions. Work on this has commenced and will be complete this year."

"In January 2020, we announced a multi-decade aspiration to be a resource-positive company, giving more than we take from the planet. This means storing more carbon than we emit, eliminating waste and replenishing more freshwater than we use. We set preliminary 2030 reduction targets, pledging to cut company-wide carbon, water and waste footprints by half, working from a 2018 baseline. Since then, our carbon goal has been validated as science-based from the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi), and as part of the validation process we adjusted our baseline year for all three reduction targets to FY19. The SBTi has confirmed that our scope 1 and 2 portion of our 2030 carbon target is aligned with a 1.5°C pathway, the most ambitious level they validate."
"SBI has undertaken the ambitious goal of becoming a carbon neutral bank by 2030.  Towards this end, the Bank has fine-tuned its internal targets using performance in FY 2018-19 as a new baseline.The strategy is carried out over the course in phases. SBI has prepared a comprehensive Greenhouse Gas (GHG) inventory for it's domestic operations encompassing more than 22,000 branches across India. Subsequently,  second phase constitutes the development of a GHG abatement and offset strategy which will help the Bank achieve carbon neutrality in the long term. This strategy revolves around the formulation of a detailed renewable energy (RE) procurement and deployment plan for all of SBI's operations across the country along with an offset strategy to cover any remaining emissions that are not handled by the RE procurement strategy. Finally, the implementation of the strategy to be done  using various third-party suppliers."
"The 2030 carbon science-based target, 27.5% reduction in metric tons of CO2e with a 2019 baseline, was set in 2020 after State Street had achieved the 2025 2°C aligned carbon goal  at the end of 2019.  Paired with State Street's commitment to be carbon neutral, this two-pronged approach has State Street procuring green power and carbon offsets for all energy consumption, while looking to reduce overall energy consumption each year.  The target covers all of State Street's Scope 1 + 2 emissions under operational control following the location-based method."
"In 2020, State Street achieved carbon neutrality for Scope 1 and 2 emissions through infrastructure retrofitting, purchasing renewable energy certificates (RECs) and carbon offsets, and by utilizing renewable energy sources wherever possible. Using a two-pronged approach in conjunction with State Street's science-based target which follows the location-based methodology; State Street will continue to procure RECs a on a country by country basis for remaining energy consumption and carbon offsets for remaining Scope 1 emissions."
"Statkraft commits to a power sector pathway compatible with a 1.5°C global warming target. Though Statkraft's carbon intensity is among the lowest in the European energy sector, we are continuously working to reduce our own emissions (scope 1 + market based scope 2) to reach carbon neutrality in 2040.  We aim to achieve this through decarbonisation of both our electricity generation and our district heating business, while we will continue to consume 100% certified renewable energy. We will also work with our suppliers to ensure emissions reductions in our scope 3 emissions.  All our future investment will be renewable and our business will thrive in a world committed to reaching the Paris agreement's urgent targets. Statkraft's contribution to lower emissions through renewable energy is already substantial, and the company's own emissions will be carbon neutral by 2040."

We have set a target to reduce our company-wide S1 and S2 MB emissions by 20% by 2024 from a 2019 base year. This target represents an interim milestone on our pathway towards S1 and S2 carbon neutrality by 2030. This target equates to a 4% annual linear emissions reduction each year over the course of the target period. We consider this target to be science-based because it exceeds the level of ambition required for Well-below 2C (2.5% annual linear reduction) and is aligned to the level of ambition required for 1.5C (4.2% annual linear reduction).
Emission reduction activities are carried out centering on the introduction of renewable energy.
Carbon neutral is set as a target by FYE2051 subject to Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions in the entire company.
"A meta da SulAmérica visa a redução de 40% até 2023, considerando ano base 2014. Em 2020, a redução foi de 92%. A superação das metas antes do período esperado se deu devido a medidas de eco eficiência implantadas na companhia, a venda das operações de Automóvel e massificados e, principalmente dado a pandemia da Covid-19, que nos levou a enviar 100% dos colaboradores para home office. Considerando o cenário ainda incerto pelo qual estamos atravessando, a Companhia optou por ainda não rever as metas estabelecidas. Esta revisão será realizada posteriormente."

Considering the impact of emissions from the power generation business, we include equity-method affiliates that operate the power generation business within the scope of the target. Therefore, it does not match the reported value of our SCOPE1 and 2 (market standard)."
"In FY 2020, in addition to the use of cogeneration systems and solar power generation facilities that have been already introduced, energy reduction by LED lights and daily efforts contributed to the reduction of energy consumption. The pandemic effected both sides. The energy usage at some sites decreased due to telecommuting, but those at other sites increased because of increasing use of air conditioner for ventilation. Totally, we reduced CO2 emissions from FY2019. We have already achieved about one and a half times of the goal for FY 2020, now we have set the next targets  for FY2030 and FY2050.we set our GHG emission reduction target based on the calculation method of SBT for the Well Below 2? target (to reduce GHG emissions by 35% from FY2017 levels by FY2030).  However, it has not been certified by SBT. We are also participant in the Japan Climate Initiative (https://japanclimate.org/english/) to tackle the climate-related issues."
"The Sumitomo Electric Group has set a goal of preventing greenhouse gas emissions in fiscal 2022 from rising compared to fiscal 2017 levels as one way to prevent global warming. In the past, we have actively promoted energy conservation at our bases and business divisions at the center of our environmental activities. The Energy Conservation Promotion Office serves as the secretariat, and specialist committee members are appointed for each business division to enable business divisions to act more systematically and proactively. Through these activities, we are shifting our production overseas, and we are making progress in improving our overseas energy efficiency.?In addition to these activities, CO2 emission factor of electric power decreased. As a result, the volume of greenhouse gases produced by the Group as a whole increased. In fiscal 2019, greenhouse gas emissions decreased by 13% compared to fiscal 2017, both in Japan and abroad."
"Sumitomo Forestry entered the biomass power generation business and with the start of operations of Hachinohe Biomass Electric Power in December 2018, our fiscal 2018 Scope 1/Scope 2 emissions were 3.2% compared to 2017. However, our fiscal 2020 Scope 1/Scope 2 emissions fell 2.7% compared to fiscal 2019. Major reasons for this were a readjustment of emission estimation methods that resulted in a decline in emissions (8,879t-CO2) of our overseas housing and real estate subsidiaries and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which reduced production volume of our overseas factories."
"From fiscal 2019, the Accounting Standard for Revenue Recognition (Accounting Standards Board of Japan Statement Number 29) was put into effect and as a result, calculation methods for Scope 3 of Category 1 were readjusted (fiscal 2019 values retroactively corrected).

"Previously the group reported against an intensity target of 15% reduction by 2023 using  per unit hours worked. Due to the impact of the pandemic in 2020, the ratios between the carbon emissions and per unit hours worked were disproportionate as carbon emissions were generated when the operations were closed. As such it was decided to assess 2020 against the absolute carbon emissions target which was set in 2018 at the same time as the intensity targets. Total Scope 1 emissions decreased in 2020 by 72% (2020: 7 592 tonnes) from the 66% in 2019 (2019: 27 261 tonnes), largely due to lockdown, with a significant decrease in emissions from company-owned vehicles and refrigeration gases. Total emissions for Scope 2 was 165 529 tonnes CO2 e (2019: 240 692 tonnes CO2 e), a 31% decreased (2019: 1% increase) that can be linked to the closure of our operations during lockdown and the gradual resumption of services at the properties."

"In 2017 we set a target to reduce our Scope 2 emissions to 0 by 2020, through switching to 100% renewable electricity, based on our 2014 baseline where electricity accounted for 100% of our Scope 2 emissions. In 2021 (reporting year) we have introduced a new 'Net Zero' target as described in ""Abs 2"" after meeting this target and re-evaluating our strategy.Progress against this target was deemed to be fully achieved as the target related to reducing our Scope 2 (market-based) emissions from electricity consumption to 0. This was achieved, however the reason there are reported emissions within this scope are that we now consumption 'Purchased Heating and Cooling' and the emissions from these fall within Scope 2. The emissions from 'Purchased Heating and Cooling' equate to the entire 149.70 tonnes CO2e reported, but fall in the same scope as our original target, reducing our performance against target to 98.0% achieved, despite achieving our switch to 100% renewable electricity two years early in 2017/18. We continue to maintain this performance and extend to increased use of renewable electricity across our supply chain. These targets at present are shown in Low Consumption targets. These targets were originally derived because scope 2 emissions make up around 96% of our total Scope 1 and 2 emissions. Electricity consumption is also a prominent emissions route across lots of our Scope 3 emissions."
"In this reporting year (2021) we launched our new 5-year business strategy which incorporates 'Leading Through Sustainability' as one of the three core objectives, which includes our strategic initiative for Net Zero carbon emissions. We have split this initiative out into 3 milestones targets. The first milestone ""Abs 2"" target is to reach Net Zero emissions across our company-wide Scope 1 & 2 emissions, which we believe can be achieved through a very high % of absolute reduction. Our other milestones and their full 'Net Zero' ambitions are detailed in ""Abs 3"", ""Abs 4"", ""Abs 5"", ""NZ1"", ""NZ2"" and ""NZ3"".We are achieving Net Zero via a 3-stage approach of 'Reduce', 'Convert' & 'Offset' with the latter being avoided where possible and only used where Reduce & Convert aren't possible. We're working to identify what proportion of our Scope 1 & 2 emissions we'll need to meaningfully offset, and given the below 3 points we are aiming for an absolute reduction to approx. 100 tonnes CO2e remaining , equivalent to a 97% reduction: 1) Our existing conversion to 100% renewable electricity which has reduced our absolute emissions by 3,150 tonnes CO2e (90%) to date.2) Of our remaining 332 tonnes CO2e emitted, 143 tonnes CO2e is from our use of natural gas, which we believe we'll be able to convert all of this to renewable gas and reduce our absolute emissions from gas. This year we converted our UK Head Office gas supply to renewable sources. However, in order to understand the CO2e emissions of using renewable gas and report this benefit in our emissions inventory we're waiting on updated guidance from WRI on accounting for Renewable Gas Guarantees of Origins (RGGOs) within Scope 1 emissions.3) Beyond gas use our remaining Scope 1 emissions are from refrigerant gases in store & office HVAC units. Given our size and lease status at these sites it's not economically or practically feasible for us to replace these with 'zero carbon' refrigerant alternatives. Therefore we will have no option other than offsetting these remaining emissions. From our understanding of climate science we believe that our 'Net Zero' targets align with the science for a 1.5°C trajectory. We intend to formalise this target by calculating & setting a Science Based Target in the next 1-2 years, helping improve our understanding of the decarbonisation pathway and pace required."
"This absolute emissions reduction target ""Abs 3"" forms part of our first Net Zero milestone (""NZ1""), and is to achieve Net Zero emissions across our third-party distribution partner site operations by 2025, which we believe can be achieved through a very high % of absolute reduction. We are achieving Net Zero via a 3-stage approach of 'Reduce', 'Convert' & 'Offset' with the latter being avoided where possible and only used where Reduce & Convert aren't possible. Emissions from our third-party distribution partner sites have been calculated to account for 3% of our total Scope 3 (Category 4: Upstream Transportation and Distribution) emissions.We're working to identify what proportion of the emissions in scope we'll need to meaningfully offset, however given the below 3 points we are aiming for an absolute reduction to approx. 200 tonnes CO2e remaining , equivalent to a >90% reduction: 1) By working with our third-party partners to already convert 67.5% of their electricity to renewable we have reduced related carbon emissions by 562 tonnes CO2e, with a further 641 tonnes remaining from sites using non renewable electricity which can be removed.2) The remaining emissions are from use of other fuels (gas, diesel etc) which we hope to be able to also convert to renewable in markets that allow this.3) There will likely be some emissions from refrigerant gases used in site HVAC units. We will explore with our partners the potential to replace these with 'zero carbon' refrigerant alternatives where they exist. Where this is not possible there will be no option other than offsetting these remaining emissions. We have identified this as a bespoke milestone target due to the high levels of influence we have over the operations of these third party sites to reduce their carbon emissions.In order to ensure we have an accurate account of these indirect (Scope 3) emissions we will be undertaking a full Scope 3 assessment and calculation within the next year.From our understanding of climate science we believe that our 'Net Zero' targets align with the science for a 1.5°C trajectory. We intend to formalise this target by calculating & setting a Science Based Target in the next 1-2 years, helping improve our understanding of the decarbonisation pathway and pace required."
"The second milestone ""Abs 4"" target is to reach Net Zero emissions across our third-party logistics (transportation) partner operations. We are achieving Net Zero via a 3-stage approach of 'Reduce', 'Convert' & 'Offset' with the latter being avoided where possible and only used where Reduce & Convert aren't possible. Emissions from our third-party logistics (transportation) partner operations have been calculated to account for 97% of our total Scope 3 (Category 4: Upstream Transportation & Distribution) emissions.We're working to identify what proportion of emissions in scope we'll need to meaningfully offset, but it is believed that we can achieve 70% through absolute reduction, due to:1) Working to reduce the weight of our garments, which reduces the carbon emissions using the ""distance based"" method and associated ""tonne.km"" emission factors. To date, we've seen a >40% reduction in weight due to packaging removal, packaging alternatives, light-weighting packaging and better data collection2) Our work on reducing our use of carbon intense logistics; notably reducing our use of air-freight. In 2021 our proportion of garments freighted by air was 62% lower than our base year. In addition we're also introducing lower carbon alternatives on some route such as river barges instead of road and intermodal (rail + sea) instead of road.We've identified this as a bespoke milestone target due to:1) These emissions are material to our full Scope 1-3 inventory (to our current knowledge)2) We have greater ability to collect large volumes of high quality primary data in this category3) We have a strong ability to influence change in this category due to relationships we hold with our partners4) We've reviewed and aligned to wider industry and business ambitions, including  British Retail Consortium (BRC) Climate Roadmap, which set specific transportation Net Zero targets.In order to ensure we have an accurate account of these indirect (Scope 3) emissions we'll be undertaking a full Scope 3 assessment and calculation within the next year.From our understanding of climate science we believe that our 'Net Zero' targets align with the science for a 1.5C trajectory. We intend to formalise this target by calculating & setting a Science Based Target in the next 1-2 years, helping improve our understanding of the decarbonisation pathway and pace required."
"The third Net Zero milestone relates to ""Abs 5"" target which is to reach Net Zero emissions across all our Scope 3 (Upstream and Downstream emissions) by 2040. We are achieving Net Zero via a 3-stage approach of 'Reduce', 'Convert' & 'Offset' with the latter being avoided where possible and only used where Reduce & Convert aren't possible.Emissions from our complete scope 3 (upstream and downstream) inventory are currently only partially calculated. In order to ensure we have an accurate account of these indirect (Scope 3) emissions and define a true and meaningful target, we will be undertaking a full Scope 3 assessment and calculation within the next year.We currently do not know the full inventory or how much we will need to meaningfully offset. This target will be updated next year once we have more accurate data but we are committed to Net Zero through as much absolute reduction as possible by 2040. Provisionally we have identified a few key categories* that will be the most material parts of our Scope 3 inventory to which we have already begun identifying reduction routes. We are therefore confident in a minimum absolute reduction of 67%.1) Category 1: Purchased Goods and Services. This will be the most material category and so to reduce our impact in this area we defined one of our 11 business strategic initiatives around 'Low Impact Materials' which include moving 100% of our cotton to organic and 100% of our polyester fill to recycled, both are materials that have lower carbon emissions.2) Category 4: Upstream Transportation and Distribution. We are undertaking reduction programmes as described in ""Abs 4"".3) Category 5: Waste arising from operations. 93% of our packaging is now recyclable and we have removed unnecessary packaging where possible.This target also aligns to wider industry and business ambitions, including  British Retail Consortium (BRC) Climate Roadmap, which set a complete Net Zero goal for 2040; 10 years ahead of UK (and many other) government.From our understanding of climate science we believe that our 'Net Zero' targets align with the science for a 1.5°C trajectory. We do however intend to formalise this target by calculating & setting a Science Based Target in the next 1-2 years, helping improve our understanding of the decarbonisation pathway and pace required."
"The coverage reported above includes our material environmental impact in our six home markets as it is reported in our Sustainability Report. These markets represent 98 per cent of the Bank's total number of employees. Certain emissions are not included in the calculations, such as emissions from coolants, commuting, customers' and employees' leased cars, and from the Bank's investments. The Bank's investments are analysed in asset management's climate reports, in accordance with the TCFD recommendations. Therefore are they not yet included in the base year, however the Bank's goal to have net zero emissions of greenhouse gases as soon as possible ,and by 2040 at the latest, includes lending, leasing, and investments as well as the Bank's own operations such as energy consumption and business travel.A clear strategy for how this goal is to be achieved, including sub-goals for 2025 and 2030, will be developed in the next few years. We will adopt scientifically based goals according to the Science Based Targets Initiative, orother generally accepted methodology for validation of the Paris Agreement goals. Our scenario analyses aim to align with the 1.5°C scenarios. Emissions will be measured and reported in line with established principles such as the Global Carbon Accounting Standard."
"Target was launched in 2019, but only recently (Aug 2020) fully approved by Audit committee of the board, so it is only now being sent to SBT for approval. In addition to the Group target, individual Sweco home markets (Sweden, Belgium, Denmark, Norway etc) have more stringent targets, based on the need to be a frontrunner in each home market (for instance Sweco Sweden is to be climate positiv by 2030). We are currently discussing with WBCSD and others whether to continue using 2020 as base year, change to 2019 or use a ""normalized"" 2020 to neutralize for the covid-related anormalities. This is particularly relevant for the -50% target for 2030 and the interim milestones of -25% 2025 and -75% 2035."
"""In addition to the Group target, Sweco's core markets have more stringent targets, so-called frontrunner targets, meaning that they are to be more ambitious that the national equivalent. Sweco markets are free to add additional scope 3 emissions, but not to remove. Sweco's markets in Sweden, UK and Belgium have frontrunner targets set for 2030. Sweco's markets in the Netherlands and Finland have frontrunner targets set for 2035. Sweco Norway has set its frontrunner target for 2036. Sweco's markets in Denmark, Germany, Poland, Lithuania, Bulgaria and Czech Republic have frontrunner targets set for 2040. Note that the value provided above (31031 tonnes CO2e) includes the group-wide target (18249 tonnes CO2e) and the additional scope 3 emissions added t the frontrunner targets (12782 tonnes CO2e)."""
"Swedbank has adopted a Group-wide climate target in 2020, the base year was set to 2019 and the target year is 2030. The target includes both upstream and downstream scope 3 emissions. Swedbank has committed to Science based targets and we are currently working on getting the targets accepted by the Science based target initiative."
"Swedish Match committed to Science Based Targets in March 2018 and the targets were approved by the SBTi in March 2019.  We report GHG emissions from our own facilities (Scope 1 direct emissions), emissions from purchased energy used in our own operations (Scope 2 indirect emissions), and emissions in our full value chain according to the Corporate Value Chain Standard (Scope 3) of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol. In the process of setting targets, we have identified a wide range of actions to be taken in pursuit of reducing our value chain emissions. Action plans have been set and responsibilities have been distributed across the Group for main sources of emissions. Initial actions include revisiting procurement practices and replacing materials and energy sources with alternatives of lower carbon intensity, using resources more efficiently, engaging with business partners, and, in the longer term, developing products with lower carbon intensity. We will also continuously aim to enhance our accuracy in the GHG accounting, which will help us to find further potential for reduction and to set the right priorities for our actions."

"The following provides an explanation of Target ID ""Abs1-Scope 2 Market Based."" Abs 1 encompasses 100% of all Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions throughout the company. Abs-1 strives to ""reduce Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions 50% below 2010 baseline levels by target year 2035. Where the following statements are true: a) Scope 2 carbon emissions for baseline year 2010 are equivalent to 10,336 MTCO2e, b) a 50 % reduction in Scope 2 emissions below 2010 baseline levels is equivalent to 5,168 MTCO2e (10,336 MTCO2e -5,168 MTCO2e, = 5,168MTCO2e, and c) Scope 2 emissions in calendar year 2020 were equivalent to 4,231 MTCO2e.  More than 100% of the emissions goal target was met in calendar year 2020. This goal was met through a combination of continued energy efficiency improvements within buildings considered to be large electricity users, changes in building usage, and the purchase of renewable energy credits (RECS), and a reduction in number of full time employees working in office space."
"The following provides an explanation of Target ID ""Abs 2- Scope 3 Business Travel."" Abs-2 addresses employee business travel (airline miles traveled) which encompasses 73% of all Scope 3 emissions. This target is science based by the 3% solution methodology of 3.2% p.a. reduction equating to 75% reduction over period from 2010 to 2020 for ALL Scope 3 emissions. Since the sole focus of ""ABS 2-Scope 3 Business Travel,"" is attributed to airline miles traveled, then the reduction goal needs to be more rigorous and reduced by 75% by 2025 to achieve 27.8% reduction if all other scope 3 sources remain constant (employee fleet commute). Based on this rationale, the following statements are true: a) Scope 3 employee business travel carbon emissions for baseline year 2010 are equivalent to 6,678 MTCO2e, b) a 38.1 % reduction in Scope 3 employee business travel carbon emissions below 2010 baseline levels is equivalent to 4,133 MTCO2e (6,678 MTCO2e -2,544 MTCO2e, = 4,133 MTCO2e, and c) Scope 3 employee business travel carbon emissions in calendar year 2019 were equivalent to 1,890 MTCO2E which is less than 4,133 MTCO2e. More than 100% of the emissions goal target was met in calendar year 2019. This goal was met by developing policy that limits non-essential air travel and a general decrease in overall travel and full time employees."
"In 2019, a cross functional taskforce was convened to develop a new GHG reduction goal for Synopsys.  This new goal has been publicly announced and targets a 25% reduction in total scope 1 and 2 emissions between 2018 and 2024.  In developing this goal, we referred to guidance from the Science Based Targets Initiative.  Our goal targets a 4.2% reduction on average per year over the goal period and is aligned with a 1.5 degree Celsius warming pathway. Synopsys has taken the decision not to count the renewable energy certificates purchased as part of its carbon neutrality commitment towards this goal in order to focus our emissions reduction investments on energy efficiency projects and initiatives that we feel confident are helping to bring new renewable power onto the electricity grid, with virtual power purchase agreements being an example.  We experienced a significant reduction in our energy consumption in 2020 due to office closures driven by the COVID19 pandemic."
"We have an officially validated Science-Based Target. T-Mobile commits to reduce combined absolute Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions 95% by 2025 from a 2016 base year.

"Garanti BBVA is a signatory to the SBTi since 2016 and committed to set a long-term emissions reduction target in line with SBTI. Accordingly, Garanti BBVA pledges to reduce its Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 29% by 2025 and 71% by 2035. The Bank also took an important step in 2020 to manage its direct impacts on climate change and switched to renewable energy consumption. 73 million kWh of electricity need of 809 branches and 46 buildings were totally provided from renewable energy, thus avoiding nearly 34,790 tCO2e emissions were avoided which corresponds to the carbon sink capacity of roughly 2.2 million trees. Under this agreement, IREC certificates were retired on the behalf of Garanti BBVA. As a result of its energy efficiency studies and renewable energy purchase agreements, Garanti BBVA reduced its absolute carbon emissions by 75% compared to the reference year and purchased carbon credits to neutralize its remaining emissions. The base year is selected as 2012 since our Environmental Management System was implemented. Base year Scope(1+2) emissions of  Garanti BBVA was 89.562 tCO2e. In 2020, total Scope (1+2) emissions of the bank was 22,442 tCO2e. The 75% of decrease is done via carrying out extensive energy efficiency studies since 2012. Creating green office standards is one of the prior issues we focus in fight against climate change. We switched to energy efficient products in our lighting and cooling systems. We virtualize our servers. We have 5 LEED certified buildings. We use roof type solar energy in 3 locations.

"The absolute target of TSKB is to reduce average GHG emissions of 2012-2016 by 10% until the end of 2021. 2016 is defined as the base year as it is stated in reporting guidance since target has been based on average GHG emissions over 5 years period. Average GHG emissions (Scope 1+ Scope 2 + Scope 3(upstream)) of TSKB was 927.80 tons CO2e over 2012-2016. Target is to reduce to 835.02 tons over 2017-2021. In reporting year, total GHG emissions calculated as 578.5 tons/year which is drastically lower than the year before and this is due to Covid-19 Pandemic. This resulted in considerable decrease in 4 years average GHG emissions.  Thus, this made TSKB target as achieved.  However, the last 3 years (2017-2019) average was 846.33 tons CO2e which means 87.8% of the target was achieved at the end of the 2019 and it seems now it is beyond to achieve the target. Despite it seems like it was achieved, TSKB decided to track the same target in the next  year as it is since 2020 was a year that all the world locked down, struggled and worked from home.Science Based Targets initiative (SBTI) published a guideline for financial institutions on September 2020 and it is written that if you are a financial institution that have commitment to have SBT before, you will have 2 years to set your target. In reporting year after the guideline published by SBTi, TSKB evaluated emissions released due TSKB operations to reduce its contribution on climate change and target was keeping its contribution below 1.5°C. This study does not cover Scope-3 emissions and as well as emissions from portfolio. At the end of 2020, TSKB decided to extend evaluation beyond Scope 1 and 2 to Scope 3. It is aimed to collect relevant data from customers, evaluate the data and see where the biggest challenge is and the most potential effect can be created in terms of aligning portfolio to a well below 2-degree world."

Disclosure of Scope 1+2 emission targets of 2020 and 2030 can be found under CH3.4.3 (P.45) of our 2020 CSR report, please refer to attachment on  C-FI [C12.4_2020_CSR_Report].Progress?Because of the massive construction of 5G base stations, our actual scope 1+2 GHG Emission in 2020 was 240,705.32 tons of CO2e; therefore, the target was not achieved (calculated with the 2019 base year emission of 235,938.84 tons CO2e). In order to achieve our GHG emission target, we have purchased the renewable energy through power purchase agreement (PPA), contracted to build 2,000kWp solar PV plant and continued to develop new renewable energy resource. This progress information can be found under CH3.4.3 (P.45) and CH 4.5.3(P.104) of our 2020 CSR report. please refer to attachment on  C-FI [C12.4_2020_CSR_Report]."

"This is a new target; 1 = figures are confidential /  not yet publicly disclosed (hence the ""covered emissions"" figure is incorrect)In April 2020 an overarching working group was set up to develop a climate strategy for investments, with the aim of helping to achieve  the  goals  of  the  Paris  Agreement  on  climate  change.  The  strategy  is  currently  focused  on  decarbonising  the  internally  man­aged bond and equities portfolios, i.e. on reducing these investments' carbon footprint (Scope 1+2). Our goal is to reduce this figure by 30% compared to the beginning of 2020 by 2025; this corresponds to an annual reduction in carbon intensity of roughly 7%. This current tar­get is an important step towards developing a sustainable, long­term path towards carbon neutrality by 2050. In addition, the Group is ex­amining how a climate strategy can be extended to cover additional asset classes, and how climate­friendly investments and engagement activities can be included in the strategy."

"We had previously set a goal to reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 emissions 20% below a 2014 baseline by the end of FY2020, focused solely on Coach due to company make up at the time. At the end of fiscal year 2018, Coach achieved a 21.4% reduction over a 2014 baseline, exceeding our goal. With the acquisitions of Stuart Weitzman and kate spade new york, we established a new commitment. Our current goals are to reduce GHGs by 20% below 2017 levels by 2025 for Scope 1 and 2 emissions. This target is to reduce our Scope 1 emissions from a 2017 baseline 20% by 2025. In FY2020 we reduced our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions 57% below 2017 levels, which was heavily influenced by store closures and other measures taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in overall lower energy and GHG footprint for Tapestry in late spring 2020."

"This year company conducted a qualitative scenario analysis to put together a climate mitigation strategy and targets aligned  to Science Based Targets,  NDC's, and SDG's. The boundary considered was complete operations wherein company has a management control over energy consumption and infrastructure. Assumptions included the anticipated growth of Tata Communications over the period of 10 years along with increase in energy demand keeping in mind 2DS and IES B2DS scenarios.  Forecasting method  was used to project demand whereas company's existing and futuristic renewable energy and energy saving projects were accounted. As a subset of this 10 yearlong plan, short term absolute target of 25% reduction in Tata Communication's Global GHG emission (from base year 2020) was proposed to Sustainable Development Committee. The committee suggested us to validate the plan with help of an external consultant and then formally submitting the same to SBTi for their validation. Base Year : 2020 Scope  1 Emissions : 6,360 tonnes of Co2Scope 2 Emissions : 108,908 tonnes of Co2Total : 115, 268 tonnes of Co2Scope 1 (emissions from DG sets, energy and emissions from refrigerant gases) and Scope 2 (emissions from purchased electricity)emissions data in accordance with the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard. For FY 2020 ,the data has been restated due to change to remove extrapolated data for March 2020.Reporting Year : 2021Scope  1 Emissions : 5,561 tonnes of Co2Scope 2 Emissions : 98,453 tonnes of Co2Total : 104,014 tonnes of Co2Note: Scope 1 emission includes 2 tonnes of Co2 emitted from solid  waste and wastewater treatment as we have started reporting this year and was not included in the base year calculations.Progress in 2021 :   We understand that our carbon footprint owes to the use of indirect energy, hence our primary focus is to reduce these indirect emissions. To do so, we are increasingly moving towards the use of renewable energy at our key locations. In our operations across the globe, almost 14% (~23 million kWh) of the electricity used in the reporting period was procured from either wind or solar energy. Our RE sourcing has increased by 62% globally compared to FY 2019-20.  Further company also achieved and carried out energy efficiency improvement projects and have saved 7.6 mn units as compared to FY 20."
"Having achieved the previous target of halving the specific carbon footprint by 2020 (versus baseline year FY 2008) ahead of schedule, the Company has set new carbon reduction targets. It commits to reduce absolute Scope 1 + Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 70% by 2025 over a 2016 base year. It aspires to achieve net-zero emissions by 2030. The target is for global TCS operations. Key strategies include green building as office infrastructure, energy efficiency across operations leveraging IoT and analytics, increased use of renewable energy sources (through installations within campuses and third party PPAs), working with supply chain partners to reduce value chain emissions and optimizing business air travel and employee commute. The Company's Vision 25x25 is a strategic lever which will enable achieving this aspiration, along with carbon removal offsets. Further, the Company has identified two markets and two delivery centers where it will become carbon neutral before the close of FY 2022. Due to the pandemic lockdown and restricted operations, our absolute footprint reduced by 48.8% over the last reporting year. This reduction is an exception, and we expect as normal operations resume, our footprint levels will increase from the values reported this year."

"Québec has a GHG cap-and-trade program under the Western Climate Initiative (WCI) GHG emissions market. The government allocates free emission units for the majority of Bécancour's 2020 compliance requirements. The remaining requirements were met with GHG instruments purchased at auctions or secondary markets. The costs of these emissions units are recovered through commercial contracts. The Canadian Mainline natural gas pipeline facilities in Québec are also subject to this program and compliance instruments have been purchased in order to comply with the requirements of this initiative. The significant similarities between Quebec and California's systems are largely dictated by detailed policy architecture prepared over a period of several years by the WCI and their partner jurisdictions.  The Quebec system linked with California's cap-and-trade system in 2014.We were actively involved in developing this program during industry consultation, as we encourage and support regulations and programs that standardize emission requirements, and allow for compliance flexibility, across our assets jurisdictionally. The ambitions of the Quebec cap-and-trade program to pursue a science-based target are unknown.Adherence to this program inherently drives us to reduce emissions (through innovation, technology or other practices/procedures), or accept increased financial obligations."
"The California cap-and-trade program ensures that GHG targets are met by setting an emissions limit – a declining cap – on 85% of emissions, primarily transportation, industry, and electricity generation emissions. Emitters must have sufficient allowances to meet their emissions limit, but how they do that is up to them. The system is not command and control, but rather allows for compliance flexibility and long-term business planning, while the price signals motivate long-term investment in cleaner fuel and energy efficiency. TC Energy incurs costs associated with the cap-and-trade program with respect to our electricity marketing activities.Adherence to this program inherently drives us to reduce emissions (through innovation, technology or other practices/procedures), or accept increased financial obligations.The ambitions of the California cap-and-trade program to pursue a science-based target are unknown."

"TD has set an interim target to achieve an absolute reduction in GHG emissions from our operations (Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions) by 25% by 2025, relative to a 2019 baseline.This target is a part of our global Climate Action Plan. In November 2020, TD announced its global Climate Action Plan, including a target to achieve net-zero GHG emissions associated with its operations and financing activities by 2050, aligned to the associated principles of the Paris Agreement. The first steps of our Climate Action Plan include establishing GHG emissions baselines across our business and financing portfolio, along with setting interim GHG emissions reduction targets on the path towards 2050."
"COVERAGE: This target was set as TDC A/S-wide coverage - meaning that it (and the emissions reported) covers 100% of TDC NET + all of TDC A/S and Nuuday A/S. This target was set in 2011, prior to the wide-spread adoption of the Science Based Targets initiative approach. We over-achieved our 2020 target in 2019 by reducing our emissions versus the baseline by 72%. During 2019, we committed to the UN Business Ambition for 1.5C Pledge and setting SBTi targets. We have now set SBTi targets for Scope 1, 2 and 3 which have a 2020 base year and a 2030 target date."

"TechM has defined strategies and roadmap to manage environmental impact across the value chain. We have adopted medium and long term emission targets to reduce 22% by 2030 and 50% by 2050 across the globe, approved by  Science-Based Targets (SBTi), to increase our focus on addressing impacts of climate change.  We signatory to Business Ambition of 1.5 °C and have taken targets to reduce our emissions Scope 1, 2 & 3 (including all relevant categories of Scope 3) emissions from base year 2016 to halve our emissions by  2030 and net-zero till 2050.  We have joined with  1.5°C Supply Chain Leaders (led by Exponential Roadmap Initiative and supported by International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) and We Mean Business Coalition). We have taken targets to increase our Renewable Energy (RE) to 50% by 2025.Our start year is 2018 (2017-18) and reporting year is 2021(2020-21).  Our target is to achieve Scope 1+2 emissions reduction by 50% by 2050 across the globe, which are approved by SBTi. The scope of reporting on environmental indicators is 100% including India and global operations.  Refrigerant gas leak refilled during maintenance of equipment,  impacted our Scope 1+2 emissions by 6741.01MTCO2e. Due to pandemic situation most of our associates were Working from Home, so we have accounted these emissions in Scope 3. Achievements: We have increased our RE from 1.77% (base year-2015-16) to 21.2% (reporting year 2020-21) to reduce our emissions. We have reduced our Scope 1 + 2 emissions by 31% against FY20 and 35% against base year FY16. By reporting year, we have achieved a reduction of 39960 MTCO2e from base year 2016.  To conclude, we have achieved 69.92% of the target in the current reporting year (2020-21).For more details on SBTi targets, climate actions and emissions, refer on pdf page 171-174 of our Integrated Annual Report (IAR) 2020-21 at https://insights.techmahindra.com/investors/annual-report-20-21.pdf.

We are signatory to Business Ambition of 1.5 °C & have taken targets to reduce our emissions Scope 1, 2 & 3 (including all relevant categories of Scope 3) emissions from the base year 2016 to halve our emissions by 2030 and net-zero till 2050. We have partnership with 1.5°C Supply Chain Leaders (led by Exponential Roadmap Initiative and supported by International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) & We Mean Business Coalition). We have taken targets to increase our Renewable Energy (RE) to 50% by 2025. Our start year is FY2018 (2017-18) & reporting year is FY2021(2020-21).  Our target is to achieve Scope 1+2 emissions reduction by 22% by 2030 across the globe, which are approved by SBTi. The scope of reporting on environmental indicators is 100% including India and global operations. Refrigerant gas leak refilled during maintenance of equipment, impacted our Scope 1+2 emissions by 6741.01TCO2e. Due to pandemic situation most of our associates were Working from Home, so we have accounted those emissions in Scope 3. Achievements: We have increased our RE from 1.77% (base year-FY2015-16) to 21.2% (reporting year FY2020-21) to reduce our emissions. We have reduced our Scope 1 + 2 emissions by 31% against FY20 and 35% against base year FY16. By reporting year, also achieved a reduction of 39960TCO2e from base year 2016.  To conclude, we have achieved 158.9% of target in current reporting year (FY2020-21)For more details on SBTi targets, climate actions and emissions, refer on pdf page 171-174 of our Integrated Annual Report (IAR) 2020-21 at https://insights.techmahindra.com/investors/annual-report-20-21.pdf.

The Scope 2 emissions recorded for the year 2020 were affected by the pandemic from Covid-19.
"Initial target was to achieve 10% of electricity from renewable sources by end of 2015, moving from 7.2% in 2013 to 13.3% in 2015.  This target was then replaced with a target to achieve 20% of electricity from renewable sources by end of 2018 which was met.  In 2019, electricity from renewable sources had increased to 24%. A new target to achieve 30% of electricity from renewable sources was set to be reached by end 2022."
"In 2010, we established company-wide short and long-term energy and GHG reduction targets to drive GHG emissions reductions at our operations compared to business-as-usual practices. In 2016, building on the success of the first five years of our sustainability strategy the company established a second set of five year sustainability goals targeting 2020, including our goal to implement projects that reduce emissions by  275 kilotonnes (kt) of CO2e by 2020. We measure and quantify reductions on a project by project basis, following standard project accounting practices. Reduction projects also undergo an internal assurance process that scrutinizes the eligibility of projects to contribute to the Teck goals, as well as the quantification methods.  While this goal was set in 2015, as noted, the 2020 goal is a cumulative value of emission reduction projects implemented from 2011-2020, and is measured against business-as-usual performance. In order to accurately reflect our goal performance within the constraints of the CDP questionnaire, we have depicted a 2020 base year which reflects the business-as-usual emissions that would have occurred if emission reduction projects had not been implemented. The value entered in the ""Targeted reduction from base year"" field reflects the reduction required annually from that business-as-usual case. Going forward (i.e. post 2020), Teck has set an ambitious objective of achieving carbon neutrality across all its operations and activities by 2050.  Teck has also set the following short term Goals in early 2020: -Reduce the carbon intensity of our operations by 33% by 2030.-Procure 50% of our electricity demands in Chile from clean energy by 2025 and 100% by 2030.-Accelerate the adoption of zero-emissions alternatives for transportation by displacing the equivalent of 1,000 ICE vehicles by 2025."
"Teck has set an ambitious objective of achieving carbon neutrality across all its operations and activities by 2050. Teck starts from a strong position to work towards carbon neutrality, building on our track record of taking action to reduce our carbon footprint and improve energy use at our operations.Teck has also set the following short term Goals in early 2020: -Reduce the carbon intensity of our operations by 33% by 2030.-Procure 50% of our electricity demands in Chile from clean energy by 2025 and 100% by 2030.-Accelerate the adoption of zero-emissions alternatives for transportation by displacing the equivalent of 1,000 internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles by 2025Teck will deploy a range of measures, technologies and approaches to achieve our goal of being carbon neutral by 2050. At a high level, this will include looking at alternative ways of moving materials at our mines, using cleaner power sources, and implementing efficiency improvements. We have set out an initial roadmap to achieve carbon neutrality by first avoiding emissions and then eliminating or minimizing emissions. Based on this approach, we have prioritized our most significant emissions sources and most mature technologies, among other factors. The most significant sources of emissions across our business today and in the future are from power supply and mobile equipment such as haul trucks. To decarbonize these emission sources and ultimately achieve our goal of carbon neutrality, we will advance the following options:• Increase procurement of electricity for operations from clean energy sources such as solar• Replace internal combustion engine vehicles through the adoption of zero-emissions alternatives• Use low-carbon alternatives for moving material at sites, such as replacing diesel haul trucks with electric orlow-carbon trucks, or using electricity-powered conveyors• Use lower emission alternatives for stationary combustion processes (e.g. steelmaking coal dryers)• Assess the potential for using emerging technologies such as carbon capture and storage• Work with industry partners (ICMM, COSIA, etc.) to advance carbon reduction technologies for miningWe are actively evaluating solutions that are commercially competitive today and monitoring earlier stage technologiesas they mature towards commercial viability."
Teck set the short term goal in early 2020 to reduce the carbon intensity of our operations by 33% by 2030.
"In 2019, we set a net zero by 2030 target (base year 2018), which will include phasing out non-renewable energy at all our sites, and switching to green gas and natural refrigerants. In 2019 and 2020, we procured 100% renewable electricity for all our U.K. sites, and are therefore well on our way to achieving this target."
Ted Baker's commitment this year to Textiles 2030 means we have set a target to become net zero by 2050.
Water and electricity used in the production and operation activities and office areas of the factoryWe used when we can recycled content or Dope dye content on our cut &sew product.
This target is a part of long-term target disclosed in net-zero target (C4.2c). Targeted reduction from base year (%) has been raised to 30% from 20% that was set in 2019.
The boundary includes Teijin Groups' consolidated companies. Covered emissions in target year represent 2/3 of total emissions of relevant scope3 categories. The target is set for scope 3: Purchased goods and services and the reduction emissions for the target cover 77% of this category. We have focused this coverage by excluding trading business since the suppliers of trading business change frequently and are difficult to engage for mid-to-long term initiative for reducing GHG emissions. We calculate the corresponding emissions every year.
"The target covers all our gross-global Scope1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions. This target has been set in line with the Well Below 2 Degrees Scenario. We target a reduction of 15 % from our gross-global Scope1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions, over a period of 6 years, which translates to a 2.50 % reduction per year on average. The target is also checked using the target setting tool of SBTi, which resulted in the same reduction figure to be in line with the IEA WB2C using the absolute contraction approach. Although currently, our GHG emissions have increased by 2.97% compared to the base year of this target, keeping our investment plans in mind, we still believe we can reach this target until the target year."
"The target covers all our gross-global Scope1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions. This target has been set in line with the Well Below 2 Degrees Scenario. We target a reduction of 40.2 % from our gross-global Scope1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions, over a period of 18 years. This target is in line with our 1st Target of reducing our GHG emissions by 15% until 2025, which translates to a 2.50 % reduction per year on average. After 2025 we are aiming to reduce our GHG emissions by 2.1% per year, which makes up an extra 25.2% absolute reduction from 2019 levels. Both of these targets combined, we are aiming a total of 40.2% reduction over a period of 18 years.Although currently, our GHG emissions have increased by 2.97% compared to the base year of this target, keeping our investment plans in mind, we still believe we can reach this target until the target year."
"In the past 5 years, Teknion has experienced substantial growth. Production has increased by  33.5% and we were able to keep the absolute amount of GHG from Scope 1 the same, not increasing emissions at all. We were able to accomplish this by various GHG conservation initiatives."
"At Teknion, this year we are very proud that will extensive work with our local utility and the manufacturing managers, we were able to meet our scope 2 target. A portion of reduction is the result of the generators reducing GHG emissions. Oil generators are being limited in the province of Ontario, greatly reducing greenhouse gas emissions.  The remainder of the reduction  due to reduction activities at each of the manufacturing sites including various retrofits mentioned earlier."
"Teknion struggles with market pressures and the diversity of vast multitude of product options that we are expected for to provide.  Market standards  have prevented Teknion to achieve the goal because excess product needs to be on hand which prevents the . Furniture design has changed, the market is wanting a non uniform furniture layout, with non uniformity comes with an increase in waste. Custom pieces produce substantially more waste however, Teknion works with our engineers and design teams to try to mitigate as much waste as possible with our design for the environment policy."
Covid has really reduced the carbon emissions from travel. We hope to continue to maintain 5% reduction year of year moving forward
"Tele 2 submitted our targets to SBT in December 2020 and the targets were approved in 2021.  Therefore we consider this a SBT although it was not yet approved during the reporting year. By reducing our GHG emissions in scope 1&2 by 90% between 2019 and 2025 it qualifies as being 1.5 degree aligned. Abs 1 is a sub-target to the longer Abs 2 target. Both targets are included in the targets submitted to the SBTi.Included in the target are the markets in Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia and Sweden which are the continuing operations. The coverage of base-year emissions for Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia and Sweden is 100%. Note that the target does not include the markets in Croatia, Germany or Kazakhstan as Tele 2 no longer operates in those markets. The target coverage reported for the base year is 48% due to operations in Croatia, Germany and Kazakhstan at the time."

"The emissions taken into consideration are  and indirect emissions due to purchase and consumption of electrical energy from grid (Scope2).  In 2021 TIM will join the SCIENCE BASED INITIATIVE by setting SBT targets.At the end of July 2021 TIM will announce  a  revised target for renewable energy with the intention to push the target up to 100% renewable energy by 2025 (please see the presentation at https://www.gruppotim.it/it/investitori/report-presentazioni/presentazioni-webcast.html, available from 28 of July), also further to the signing of a very important Power Purchase Agreement with ERG for the supply of 3.4 Terawatt of green energy, produced in ERG's wind farms, for the next 10 years. This agreement alone accounts for around 20% of our domestic consumption.TIM's renewable target is in line with an ambitious Group target: becaming Carbon Neutral in 2030."
This year TIM management set a new target of Carbon neutrality until 2030. The target applies to  Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions combined. In 2021 TIM will join the SCIENCE BASED INITIATIVE by setting SBT targets.
"In 2020, in view of the urgent need to reduce CO2 emissions and given the need identified by the scientific world to increase ambition, we announced new energy and climate change (CC) targets for 2025, 2030, and 2040, aligned with the 1.5ºC scenario of the Paris Agreement and validated by the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi).These targets are part of our CC strategy, which aims to decouple the growth of our business from energy consumption and GHG emissions and help us to leverage decarbonisation opportunities, to be more competitive, and to offer our customers an ever-cleaner network. With this purpose, we have defined a path of emission reduction until 2040, establishing milestones of emission reduction: Reduce our Scope 1&2 emissions by 70% in absolute terms by 2025, 80% by 2030, and achieving net-zero emissions in our main markets (Spain, Brazil, UK and Germany) by 2025 (Scope 1&2), and globally by 2040 (incl. Scope 3).In 2020 we reduced our total Scope 1&2 emissions by 61.1% compared with 2015 (base year). This has been possible mainly thanks to the actions within our Energy Efficiency Plan (EEP) and our Renewable Energy Plan (REP). These actions are based on implementing energy efficiency projects and transitioning to a greater proportion of renewable electricity. - Our EEP enables Telefónica to decouple its business growth from energy consumption so that in 2020 we achieved 80.9% improvement of our energy-intensive ratios (MWh/Traffic PB)- Under the REP  in 2020 we achieved a renewable-sourced electricity consumption of 87.5% at a global level.Despite the challenges for buying renewable electricity in some of the countries we operate, thanks to the extension of guarantee of origin programmes in LatAm, countries such as Chile, Colombia, and Peru managed to certify 29%, 61%, and 100% respectively of their electricity consumption.  In 2020, we continued our ambitious distributed generation project in Brazil, covering 42% of our electrical consumption and thus reducing dependence on iRECs.OTOH, Scope 1 emissions come from 2 main sources: fuel consumption and fugitive emissions of refrigerant gases from air conditioning units. We reduce these through different initiatives, such as replacing fuel-powered generators with renewable self-generation and cooling units with free cooling or with other units whose refrigerant gases have lower GWP."

"In 2020 we set ourselves ambitious new goals which go further than the Paris Agreement. We will be a company with net-zero emissions in our main markets (Spain, Brazil, Germany, and the UK) by 2025 and, including our value chain and HispAm, by 2040 at the latest. To achieve this, we will reduce our emissions by 70% by 2025 (90% in our main markets), 80% by 2030, 90% by 2040, and emissions in our value chain by 39% by 2025 and 90% by 2040.  These reductions are in line with the 1.5ºC scenario, and residual emissions will be neutralised via nature-based projects.In order to align with the latest Net Zero foundations paper published by the SBTi, Telefónica increased the ambition of its Scope 3 target by a) including all Scope 3 emissions into the target; and b) increasing its ambition to ensure the targeted reduction aligned with the 1.5C pathway. We have not only included an ambitious reduction target to reduce value chain emissions by an amount consistent with net-zero in global scenarios that limit warming to 1.5C, but also in our own emissions; that's why we include Scope 1 and 2 in our emissions reduction pathway."
"We calculate and reduce our carbon footprint every year, including direct emissions (Scope 1) from fuel consumption and fugitive emissions of refrigerant gases and indirect emissions from electricity consumption (Scope 2), and other indirect emissions related to our value chain (Scope 3).Telefónica has estimated the emissions of the 15 categories included in the GHG Protocol Scope 3 Standard in order have a comprehensive view of the total Scope 3 emissions related to its business lines in all the geographies. This has allowed us to identify the most relevant categories for our activity. Fuel-and-energy-related activities are one of the most important categories, representing 8.1% of our scope 3 emissions. Our objective was aimed to reduce 25% emissions associated with the energy life cycle (category 3 of Scope 3).In 2019 we have achieved a 100% reduction of this target with respect to 2016 (our base year), this was possible thanks to the actions within our Energy Efficiency Plan and our Renewable Energy Plan. In 2020 we reviewed our decarbonisation path and set a new target covering not only Fuel-and-energy-related activities but all other relevant categories for our value chain. This new target is described in ABS5."
"In order to align with the latest Net Zero foundations paper published by the SBTi, Telefónica increased the ambition of its Scope 3 target by a) including all Scope 3 emissions into the target; and b) increasing its ambition to ensure the targeted reduction aligned with the 1.5C pathway.To achieve this target, Telefónica is firmly committed to an open, collaborative relationship with its suppliers. Our commitment to them is based on establishing relations that enable us to jointly have a positive impact on our surroundings, through close collaboration and the sharing of good practices, fostered thanks to different initiatives with our suppliers, as the participation in ECOVADIS or JAC (Joint Audit Cooperation). In this sense, we work on the management of emissions in the supply chain, both globally and at a local level. In 2020, we created a new sector-based working group as part of the Joint Audit Cooperation (JAC) initiative, in order, as a telecommunications sector, to drive climate action in our supply chain. We assessed the climate-related maturity of the strategic suppliers of the 17 companies who are part of the conglomerate and began working along several different lines in order to increase their level of ambition, as well as providing training in collaboration with CDP and GSMA for the major Chinese companies.Globally, in 2020 we continued our supplier engagement programme about climate change with our key suppliers. we gathered information from our suppliers to understand the maturity level of their climate strategies and help them set more ambitious emission reduction targets, to inspire them to take action and offered them a best practices forum to foster innovation and exchange of practices. The suppliers included in this programme represent 66% of the emissions from our supply chain and 37% of our total Scope 3 emissions. In order to optimise the supplier assessment process, in 2020 we joined the CDP Supply Chain programme. Another significant action in 2020 related to our commitment to working with the supply chain was to join the ""1.5 ºC Supply Chain Leaders"" initiative, which advocates reducing the emissions of the small and medium enterprises that are part of our value chain. This programme enables us to reinforce our role in the value chain and accelerate the decarbonisation of the global economy."
"In 2020, in view of the urgent need to reduce CO2 emissions and given the need identified by the scientific world to increase ambition, Telefónica Group announced new energy and climate change (CC) targets for 2025, 2030, and 2040, aligned with the 1.5ºC scenario of the Paris Agreement and validated by the SBTi.

Representing around 30% of the total energy demanded by the group, Telefônica Brasil was the first operation outside of Europe to achieved 100% of electricity coming from renewable sources and is the first operation to become carbon neutral in the group. Note: Scope 1 emissions come from 2 main sources: fuel consumption and fugitive emissions of refrigerant gases from air conditioning. We seek to reduce these through different initiatives: maintenance changes such as reducing testing time on generators and studying fuel-powered generators that run on renewable fuel, as well as individual measurements on air conditioning machines to prevent gas leakage."

This target applies to A1 in Austria only.
"The target applies to the whole A1 Telekom Austria Group - this includes our companies in Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia, Belarus, Serbia, Slovenia and North Macedonia. The reduction path is the baseline for another target from A1 Telekom Austria Group:  Reach net carbon neutrality by decreasing the own carbon footprint and gradually switching to energy from renewable sources (please see https://www.a1.group/en/esg-goals). Please note that due to data quality improvements in the course of the environmental data collection 2020, figures for 2019 were restated. Therefore the base year emissions for 2019 are different to the base year emissions reported within the CDP response 2020."

"Telenor's  science-based target (SBT) of 57% reduction globally was approved by and published 6 May 2021 by the  Science-Based Targets initiative. Due to the big differences in energy mix, electricity grid robustness and electricity market regulations between Nordic and Asia, Telenor has separate internal  sub-targets for Asia and Nordic that add up to the formal  global SBT: 95% reduction in Nordic and 50% reduction in Asia. The main initiatives required to meet the target in Nordic are:•   Scope 1 emissions: These emissions are mainly from fuel consumption from company car fleet. To eliminate these, we must reach a close to 100% electric car fleet by 2030.•   Scope 2 emissions: These emissions are from our electricity consumption. To eliminate these, we will  ensure that all electricity is from renewable sources through a mix of power purchase agreements (PPAs) and Guarantees of Origin.•   Both scopes: Energy efficiency measures in network operationsThe main initiatives required to meet the target in Asia are:•Scope 1 emissions:  Replace diesel usage with solar or wind solutions at off-grid and bad-grid base stations•Scope 2 emissions: Ensure that the majority of purchased grid electricity in the region electricity is from certified renewable sources either through power purchase agreements (PPAs) and/or through I-RECs. This will require overcoming current regulatory limitations for investments in renewable energy at scale in Telenor's Asia markets.•Both scopes: Energy efficiency measures in network operations"
Telent has committed to developing  Science Based Targets and intends to have these implemented in 2022.
"Telia Company commits to reduce absolute scope 1 and 2 (market-based) GHG emission 50% by 2025 (baseline year; 2018). This is aligned with the ICT trajectory for the 1,5 degree pathway."
"Telia Company commits to reduce absolute emissions related to use of sold products GHG emission 29% by 2025 from a 2018 base year. This is aligned with the ICT trajectory for the 1,5 degree pathway.The base year (2018) emissions need to be updated for scope 3 category 11 due improved calculation and updated product energy consumption. For this reason progress against base year cannot be reported."
This target was set with the expectation that Telstra would seek formal alignment with the SBT 1.5 degree pathway. Telstra anticipates that it will have an SBTi approved target covering scopes 1-3 by the end of 2021.
"This was previously reported as ABS1 in 2020 CDP Submission. This target is an absolute reduction of company-wide Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions (in previous years the target scope was domestic Canadian scope 1 & scope 2 emissions). We have improved our company-wide emissions reductions through the reduction of energy usage (19% absolute reduction from 2010 levels) which was achieved through a combination of network energy optimization projects, LED retrofits in office space, reductions in operating real estate space and the installation of more efficient heating and cooling equipment.  At the end of 2020 we had achieved a 37% reduction in our company-wide GHG emissions from our 2010 levels.  This target will carry forward into our Net-Carbon Neutrality by 2030 target that was announced in 2020. TELUS also had the following Science Based Targets approved by SBTi in early 2021 which are aligned to the 1.5 degree scenario:TELUS commits to reduce absolute scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions 46% by 2030 from a 2019 base year.* TELUS also commits to reduce absolute scope 3 GHG emissions from business travel and employee commuting 46% within the same timeframe. TELUS commits to reduce scope 3 GHG emissions from purchased goods and services, capital goods and use of sold products 75% per million dollars of revenue within the same timeframe. *The target boundary includes biogenic emissions and removals from bioenergy feedstocks"
"During 2020 Tendam, has achieved a new milestones in its commitment to combat climate change. We have recently submitted our  greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction targets to be approved by the Science Based Target initiative (SBTi). This is part of our strategy towards decarbonisation in line with the targets set in the Paris Agreement to reduce carbon levels.During 2021, our Science Based Targets  will be validated together with the reduction plan. This formalises our work in the fight against climate change by setting measurable and specific commitments as we continue to promote the transition to a low carbon economy.Tendam commits to reduce absolute scopes 1 and 2 (market based + location based) GHG emissions 46.2% by 2030 from a 2019 base year. This target is aligned with the Business Ambition 1.5ºC which allow us to make a critical contribution to limit the worst impacts of climate change. To achieve our targets we have develop our first Climate Change Roadmap (2021-2025) which aim to guide our carbon neutrality journey. This Roadmap integrates  a holistic approach with five strategic pillars that will facilitate the consecution of our Science Based target: (1) Corporate governance and climate change strategy; (2) Carbon neutrality; (3) Circular economy; (4) Commitment; (5) Transparent reporting and communication. To ensure we meet this target, we are continuously working on our Energy Efficiency Program at our own stores and will progressively invest in electricity coming from renewable energy in different countries where we operate.  During 2020, we have started a pilot project at our Cortefiel stores using the ''Internet of things”. Through this project, Tendam has managed to reduce energy consumption by 19-26%, depending on  Cortefiel stores where this has been implemented. Besides, since 2015 we are immerse in a LED lighting program that will facilitate further consumption reduction and associated GHG emissions. Currently, 30% of our stores have this technology and we are working to expand it in the coming years. LED lighting is up to 80% more efficient and consumes less energy than traditional lighting, resulting in a reduction in power consumed ranging from 10% to 20%."
"The 25% absolute reduction target (Abs 1) was approved by Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) in early 2018. The reduction achieved through 2020, compared to base year 2016, was 34.8% ((32,480 - 21,165.7) / 32,480). As of 12/31/20, we have achieved this target, with 139.3% (34.8% / 25%) of progress toward the Abs 1 target in 28.6% (4 / 14 years) of time to target.This target includes at least 99% of the company's total, global gross Scope 1+2 emissions for base year 2016.What is not covered by this target are small facilities and facilities scheduled for demolition. We reassess our operational control boundary annually and did so in Q1 2021. We have a number of small facilities along with several unoccupied facilities scheduled for demolition. All emissions from these facilities are less than 1% of total emissions covered by the target reporting boundary. When conducting the annual boundary assessment, if we identify relevant emissions not previously reported we restate prior year emissions to include them. No boundary-related restatements are included in our CDP Climate Change 2021 response.IPC Group (acquired in April 2017) emissions are reported as part of 2020 total Scope 1+2 emissions. IPC Group represents 14% of our 2020 market-based Scope 1+2 emissions, but IPC is not part of 2016 base year emissions for the Abs 1 target.Gaomei (acquired in January 2019) emissions are reported as part of 2020 total Scope 1+2 emissions. Gaomei represents 4% of our 2020 market-based Scope 1+2 emissions, but Gaomei is not part of 2016 base year emissions for the Abs 1 target.We intend to set new, more ambitious SBTs which also include both IPC and Gaomei. Work on these began in Q4 2020, and we aim to submit them to SBTi in Q4 2021."
"We do not consider 2020 as a std reporting yr, as we shutdown our offices due to COVID19 protocols in March of 2020.   Even 2021 will be hugely impacted by COVID as to date we have only opened 5 offices.  Our major footprints are still closed.   Our true sucess towards our ABS GHG reduction is that from 2018 to 2019, we reduced our ABS GHG emissions by 15%!  We closely track our Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), report on an annual basis to the CDP, and  actively address our carbon footprint through energy management. Over the last 12 years, we have set five greenhouse gas energy intensive goals (GHG EI) based on energy usage and hardware production units, meeting the first four goals. The most recent goal, set in 2018, targets a reduction of our GHG intensity by 10% by 2022. As our product mix is shifting from nearly all on-premises equipment to cloud-based, we are evolving our GHG goals to be representative of a cloud company, including a revision of this goal."
"We have a year over year target to reduce emissions by 1%.  We went from a scope 1 &2 emissions in 2019 of 31,141 to 31,652 in 2020.  A slight overall increase in emissions.  Similar to past years, we have continued to acquire companies that we did not previously have in the prior reporting year.  Even when we normalize, practices for reducing carbon footprint have not yet been adopted by all of these locations.  As we on board new companies, it does take some time for them to adopt our policies and begin working towards our sustainability goals.   Our challenge continues to be  the ongoing addition of companies and real estate to the portfolio as we implement strategies to reduce scope 1 and 2 emissions."
"We are targeting a 15% reduction in Greenhouse Gas (''GHG”) emissions by 2024 (from our 2019 baseline).  We monitor GHG emission from direct combustions,  electricity, refrigerants and vehicle fuel usage. All of our Manufacturing sites participate in our greenhouse gas emission reduction campaign and are required to put processes in place that will reduce emissions.Terex achieved this target in 2020 due to implementing energy efficient projects and use of renewable energies."
"No reporte CDP 2019, a companhia não possuía meta definida, porém informou que planejava inserir nos próximos 2 anos, o que de fato realizou, incluindo no reporte de 2020 a meta de redução de 76,5% em suas emissões de CO2eq. na somatória dos escopos 1, 2 e 3 tomando o ano base 2012, utilizando a metodologia de emissões GHG Protocol"
"In line with its Sustainability Plan, during 2020 Terna carried out its own survey of CO2 emissions, followed by a feasibility assessment of a Science Based Target deliverable, which was approved by senior management on 19 October 2020, and formally signed off by the Board of Directors at a meeting on 11 November 2020. Later, a formal letter of enrolment in the SBT Initiative has been signed.The reduction target was then submitted and approved by the SBT Initiative in the first half of the 2021.The target set addresses scope 1 + 2 emissions of the entire Terna S.p.A., and intends to reduce absolute emissions 28% by 2030 from a 2019 base year, and is modelled using the Absolute Contraction approach.-Please note that the sum of the scope 1 and scope 2 location-based emissions reported in this question, for 2019 and 2020, does not match the sum of the scope 1 and scope 2 location-based emissions reported in the rest of the questionnaire (e.g. sections C5, C6 and C7), due to the following reasons: the GHG emissions reported in the entire questionnaire, except for those reported in question 4.1a, are in line with the emissions reported and reviewed in Terna 2020 Sustainability Report / Non-financial Disclosure. Specifically, scope 2 location-based emissions do not include emissions due to grid losses; the emissions due to grid losses are reported among scope 3 emissions. -During the evaluation and approval of Terna's SBT, the SBT Initiative requested that emissions due to grid losses should be included within scope 2. Therefore, only in question 4.1a, with the aim of being consistent with SBTi's approved target, scope 1 and scope 2 location-based emissions were aligned with the approach of the target SBT.Starting from next year, the scope 2 location-based emissions reported in the CDP questionnaire and in Terna's annual Reports will be aligned with SBTi's indications."
"The target, replaced by the Science based target presented, was is elaborated on the base of following considerations:- the effect of energy efficiency initiatives on the offices (effects already underway: );- installation plan for more efficient substation equipment (consumption for electric substations weighs on average 80% of total electricity consumption);- effect of a CO2 conversion factor that takes into account a larger share of renewables on the national mix .- the reduction in Gas leakages SF6 as a percentage of the total amount of gas in the system. Such achievement would be possible thanks to the expected effect of the containment measures planned"
"Terumo group has established a long-term GHG reduction targets (fiscal year 2050 and 2030 target) that based on ""Science Based Targets"" in fiscal year 2019.  The target of fiscal year 2030 was approved as science-based target by the international organization of Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). The target is classified to be aligned with the ""well-below 2 degrees"", which was just defined by the latest SBTi Criteria (4.0) on October 2019. The target scope is the entire Terumo Group, but 5 affiliated companies (Quirem Medical B.V., Wego Terumo (Weihai) Medical Products Co., Ltd., Shanghai Angiocare Medical Technology Co.,Ltd., Olympus Terumo Biomaterials Corp., and Terumo BSN K.K.) are outside of the target scope by the equity method due to less than 50% voting rights ownership, financial support, and no business transactions.In addition, there was an input error in last year's survey regarding CO2 emissions in the base year (281,386 tons), so this year's survey response has been corrected to 281,378 tons."

The target that was valid for 2020 covered Scope 1 and Scope 2 (market based) emissions. The target did not include Scope 3 emissions.
"Our ambition since 2008 has been to be a zero carbon business, by 2050. Our Science Based Targets have been reviewed and approved by the Science Based Target Initiative, using 2015 as our baseline year. Within these, we have set a new target for 2025 on our way to achieving our 100% reduction. In 2020 we announced the sale of our Malaysian, Polish, and Thai operations and have recalculated our baseline to reflect this."
"As part of our Science Based Targets, which have been reviewed and approved by the Science Based Target Initiative, our target for these Scope 3 categories (Purchased goods & services; Fuel and energy related activities, upstream transportation and distribution, waste generated in operations) is to reduce emissions from the products we sell by 35% by 2030 (15% for agriculture). Achieving this target will reduce our total Scope 3 emissions by 17% by 2030. We do not report Scope 3 emissions from the products we sell in our carbon footprint externally in our Annual Report.We have not yet publicly disclosed performance against this target."
Tessy Plastics Corp. commits to reduce absolute Scope 1&2 GHG emissions 20% by 2025 from the 2016 base-year.
This target is set to address the emissions of our trucking of goods. We are looking at how we can require the use of fuel-efficient vehicles and aerodynamic designs to decrease fuel usage.
"Our science based scope 1+2 targets (mid term 2030 and long term 2040) are developed according to the science based target setting method ‘Absolute emissions compression' following the 72% emission reduction pathway from 2010 to 2050. For us this scenario translates to 3,1 % year on year emission reductions. Scope 2 calculation in this context is based on market based accounting methodology and the key areas to manage climate impact are to continue our work on improving our energy efficiency and increasing the share of renewable energy. Targets cover all greenhouse gases listed in the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Standard. Target has been approved by the Science-based target initiative's official target quality check. In 2019, Tetra Pak reached a 53%  reduction in scope 1+2 emissions compared to our 2015 baseline. The key areas where we work to manage our scope 1+2 climate impact to meet our mid-term (42% reduction by 2030) science based scope 1+2 target are improving our energy efficiency and increasing the share of renewable energy."

"In 2020 we established a target, however, due to the final approvals, the target was  officially launched in January 2021, as part of our new ESG strategy approved by our Board of Directors which sharpens our focus on the areas we view as most critical to our business and our stakeholders and in which we can have the greatest impact. Concrete, focused goals drive our progress and guide our efforts to maintain a responsible and sustainable business. Whilst our 2030 Environmental commitments and goals were internally approved and ready for external publication at the end of 2020, these were externally published in January 2021. Our set of new long-term environmental goals will help Teva advance climate action and resilience, responsible use of natural resources and improved management and reductions of emissions, effluents and waste.Our new 2030 Science Based Target (SBT) is to reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 33% Vs. 2017 levels to support efforts to limit the global temperature increase to well below 2°C, aligning with the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement. Our 2017 baseline has been adjusted for business divestitures. This new 2030 target replaces our 2018 established short-term interim target to reduce scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 10% by 2020 Vs 2017 levels to address changes in our business since our previous target was established. The 2018 target has been retired having been exceeded one year ahead of schedule. As of 2020, Teva has reduced Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 25% since 2017 (adjusted for business divestitures) helping to lessen our impact on the environment, in line with our 2030 goal to reduce Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 33%.To help us internally guide our work and measure performance against our absolute target, we intend during 2021 to establish internal normalized KPI's for our operations to track a range of environmental indicators including GHG emissions and energy consumption."
"In 2015, we established a 5-year GHG emissions-reduction goal knowing that we were implementing several projects that helped reduce our long-term GHG emissions. Due to these investments and actions, TI reduced absolute GHG emissions by 22.4% between 2015 and 2020 (exceeding our 15% goal)."
"This target is part of the absolute emission target 2 and of the intensity target. Texen has elaborated a new environmental policy in 2020. One of the objectives taken in this policy is to reduce the environmental impact of our products from the sourcing materials by promoting circular economy. This target will be part of the new objective that Texen will take in 2021 on its scope 1,2 and 3 to have its targets validated by SBT. Texen has elaborated a new environmental policy in 2020. One of the objectives taken in this policy is to reduce the environmental impact of our products from the sourcing materials by promoting circular economy.  Texen is committed to include 25% of recycled or biobased materials in its new products by 2025."
"We have focused the analysis on fuel consumption by company cars since  we consider them as  are the main source of emissions directly controlled by the  company.To calculate emission for Scope 1 we have used Excel sheets provided by www.ghgprotocol.org and we have refined emission factors by using data provided by cars' manufacturers. Unfortunately, during the base year (2018) the company has reported the wrong data as it doe not considered all the cars that it used during the base year. This has created a mismatch between the base year and the reporting one in terms of %of target achieved."
"Electricity is used for the routine office's activities.To calculate emission for Scope 2 we have summed company's consumption and the emission factor by ISPRA.Energy (natural gas) is used for heating  offices.To calculate emission for Scope 1 we have used the  GHG Protocol sheet: ""Statitionary combustion tool"""
"The Group's direct operational emissions refer to emissions related to energy consumption and use of chemicals (scope 1 & 2) and emissions relating to employee mobility (scope 3 – business travel). In 2019, the Group made a commitment to reduce these emissions by 20% by 2023 and 40% by 2030 in absolute value against a 2018 baseline covering 100% of Group's related emissions.-Reduce emissions from energy consumption : In 2020, the Group as reduced its energy consumption of 6% thanks to the low carbon strategy action plan dedicated to Operations.By the end of 2020, 23% of the Group's workforce was employed in Group entities certified to ISO 50001 ''Energy Management Systems”.In addition, 20 sites employing 16% of the Group's workforce have obtained an environmental performance certification for buildings (HQE, BREEAM, etc.). In 2020, the Group continued to reduce its fossil fuel consumption (gas, fuel oil and coal), down 2.5% compared with 2018. -  Reduce emissions related to the use of chemicals  : Along with energy, products with high global warming potential, used mainly in refrigeration systems, have been subjected to detailed action plans. Many sites have continued to replace high?emitting refrigerants with equipment containing lower emitting refrigerants and have implemented action plans to limit leaks and, in some cases, even replaced the less efficient equipment. Thus, in 2020, SF6, one of the main greenhouse gases contained in air conditioning systems, was reduced to just 1% of Group CO2 emissions related to chemicals. Total scope 1 emissions increased by 10% between 2018 and 2020, due to a 43% increase in CO2 emissions related to the use of chemicals (Kyoto Protocol). This increase resulted from a leak of extinguishing gas from a fire protection system in France and, in Australia, from the slight increase in the use of solvents to support a site's ramp?up of production."
"The Group's indirect  emissions refer to emissions related to purchased goods and services and use of sold products. In 2019, the Group made a commitment to reduce these emissions by 7% by 2023 and 15% by 2030 in absolute value against a 2018 baseline covering 100% of Group's related emissions. As part of its strategy for a Low-Carbon Future, Thales is committed to reducing emissions related to its purchases of goods and services (scope 3). These emissions were measured at 2,289 ktCO2e for 2019 and 1,992 ktCO2e for 2020, i.e. a drop of 13% compared with 2019 and of 16% compared with 2018. These estimates were made using emission factors associated with each of the Group's purchasing categories, in agreement with the external expert. The total amount of emissions was calculated at constant 2018 scope, i.e. excluding the purchases of the DIS Global Business Unit. An action plan is in place to integrate the purchases of the DIS Global Business Unit into the Group's emissions measurement. An action plan has been deployed to reduce emissions related to the Group's supply chain, in particular by establishing dialogue with its suppliers. In addition, as a member of a dedicated working group within the International Aerospace Environmental Group (IAEG), Thales took part in the drafting of a sector methodology guide for calculating emissions related to the purchase of goods and services and capital goods."
"The Group's direct operational emissions refer to emissions related to energy consumption and use of chemicals (scope 1 & 2) and emissions relating to employee mobility (scope 3 – business travel). In 2019, the Group made a commitment to reduce these emissions by 20% by 2023 and 40% by 2030 in absolute value against a 2018 baseline covering 100% of Group's related emissions.Business travel :For several years, the Group has implemented a business travel policy aiming at minimizing the associated carbon footprint. Investments in communication tools (telepresence rooms, video conferencing, etc.) make it possible to limit business travel.For business travel that cannot be avoided, the Group encourages the use of more eco?friendly modes of transport such as trains and low?energy use vehicles. In this regard, short?term car rental companies are encouraged to offer hybrid or electric vehicles.In 2020, CO2 emissions related to business travel were assessed at 29 ktCO2e, i.e. a 68% drop compared with 2019 and 69% compared with 2018. This sharp decline is explained by the reduction of business travel induced by the Covid?19 pandemic.Company car policy :The policy on Company cars is determined by the Group and is implemented in each country depending on legal and taxation provisions, local practices and the energy mix. In France, which accounts for about 50% of the vehicle fleet, a range of vehicles is available for each use with the aim  of significantly reducing the associated carbon footprint, in line with the target of a 40% reduction in operational emissions by 2030. In 2020, the  roll?out of this policy resulted in a significant increase in orders for hybrid company vehicles, which now represent almost 50% of orders. Orders for electric company vehicles are encouraged, including for utilityvehicles, associated with the installation of charging stations at the sites (69 in France, or 138 charging stations) and the introduction of a roaming charging service now available for company vehicles. This trend is expected to gain strength as the fleet is renewed, with additional demand for various ranges of electric vehicles."
"The Group's indirect  emissions refer to emissions related to purchased goods and services and use of sold products. In 2019, the Group made a commitment to reduce these emissions by 7% by 2023 and 15% by 2030 in absolute value against a 2018 baseline covering 100% of Group's related emissions. In 2020, Thales continued to fine?tune its work on modelling CO2 emissions during the use phases of products and services sold. Although uncertainties relating to these models remain significant (at around 15%), the Group is convinced of the importance of setting targets and implementing action plans aimed at reducing emissions during these phases which, for most of the Group's products, represent the majority  of their life cycle emissions.CO2 emissions related to the use phase of products put on the market in 2020 are estimated at 7.6 million tCO2e, down by 30% compared with 2019 and 32% compared with 2018 (11.2 million tCO2e updated using the fine?tuned methodology and retroactively including the DIS Global Business Unit reporting scope for hardware).  This sharp decline compared with the 2018 baseline reflects the impact of the Covid?19 pandemic on production volumes of aircraft manufacturers and, to a lesser extent, changes in activity in other segments as well as improvements made to products and solutions."
"In 2010 Allstate set a goal to achieve a 20% absolute energy-use reduction within our owned portfolio (approximately 39% of all locations at the time) against our 2007 baseline by 2020. Thanks to efforts across the enterprise, we surpassed that 2020 goal in 2014.  We have cut energy use beyond our original targets and continue to reduce our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.  (Note: Percentages are calculated based on changes in energy consumption (btu) over time and therefore differ from changes in emissions over time.  Base year emissions have been adjusted to reflect structural changes.)Now, we've set our sights on a science-based target, and have engaged with a consultant to evaluate options for goal-setting. Allstate intends to have its science-based target (SBT) scenarios for Scope 1 and 2 emissions completed during the second half of 2021. Scope 3 SBT scenarios are focused on the climate impact of our investment portfolio. Allstate intends to also complete its initial Scope 3 review during the second half of 2021 and plans to submit its intent to establish an emissions reduction target based on the Guidance for Financial Institutions from the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTI-FI), focused on the IPCC guidance consistent with a well-below 2°C pathway, by the end of 2021."
"We continue to evaluate and make changes in our operations and throughout the Coca-Cola system value chain to reduce our climate impact. This target is a Coca-Cola System level target, including The Coca-Cola Company and its bottling partners. The target brings our diverse sustainability initiatives under one goal to reduce the carbon footprint across the Coca-Cola system's full value chain by 25% by 2030, in absolute terms. Progress toward reducing the greenhouse gas emissions across our manufacturing processes, packaging formats, delivery fleet, refrigeration equipment and ingredient sourcing has been measured under an intensity target (target Int 1) from 2010 to 2020. This target, recently made public in 2019, is a Science-Based Target, and an absolute reduction target consistent with reductions required to keep warming to 2°C.Due to the nature of our franchise bottling system, in this CDP response, our manufacturing emissions are normally split between Scopes 1 and 2 for company-owned facilities and Scope 3 for bottling partner facilities. However, in our ''drink in your hand” (intensity target) calculations, as well as this absolute reduction target, we consider the full Coca-Cola system (including franchise bottling partners) in the calculation of our manufacturing, distribution and refrigeration emissions."
"In 2020, Dow announced the following climate protection targets: By 2030, Dow will reduce its net annual carbon emissions by 5 million metric tons vs. its 2019 baseline* (15% reduction). By 2050, Dow aspires to be carbon neutral (Scope 1 + 2 + 3 plus product benefits). These targets are in addition to our 2025 Sustainability Goals, which have the following climate-related objectives: Dow will obtain 750 MW of its power demand from renewable sources by 2025, and though we will grow globally over the next 10 years, Dow's absolute greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions will not exceed our 2006 baseline.  Dow considers our target to reduce emissions by 15% compared to our 2019 baseline to be 2°C aligned, and in alignment with external scenarios that indicate the level of emission reduction required in hard-to-abate sectors.  For example, under the recently released Net Zero by 2050 report from the International Energy Agency (IEA), an approximately 7.5% reduction in energy-related emissions is required by 2030 from the chemicals sector to enable net zero by 2050.*Note: Our target to reduce net annual carbon emissions by 5 million tons vs. our 2019 baseline was originally announced stating the baseline would be 2020. However, year 2020 was not representative of a typical production year due to the impact of COVID-19 on operations and production volumes. For this reason, the baseline was reassessed and 2019 was selected as the baseline year. The baseline represents Scope 1 + 2 emissions in 2019, adjusted for outliers (E.g. Abnormal number of scheduled turnarounds/outages, or unusually high production volume at a plant, etc.). The value of the baseline equals 34.7 million metric tonnes of CO2e."
"Dow does not currently have an emissions target that has been approved by the Science Based Targets Initiative.  We consider our target to be alignment with external scenarios that indicate the level of emission reduction required in hard-to-abate sectors.  For example, under the recently released Net Zero by 2050 report from the International Energy Agency (IEA), an approximately 95% reduction in energy-related emissions is required by 2050 from the chemicals sector.

However, year 2020 was not representative of a typical production year due to the impact of COVID-19 on operations and production volumes. For this reason, the baseline was reassessed and 2019 was selected as the baseline year. The baseline represents Scope 1 + 2 emissions in 2019, adjusted for outliers (E.g. Abnormal number of scheduled turnarounds/outages, or unusually high production volume at a plant, etc.). The value of the Scope 1 plus Scope 2 baseline equals 34.7 million metric tonnes of CO2e.  The covered emissions in base year represented here also include approximately 70 million metric tonnes of Scope 3 emissions at baseline."
"By 2020, we converted the ATM corners, lobbies, and business offices of 114 branches to LED lighting systems and additionally upgraded the air conditioning system and achieved improved energy efficiency at the main branch's office center, which houses the backbone systems for our bank."
"The Hartford has developed medium and long-term, science-based target-aligned goals to reduce our total scope 1, 2 and select categories of scope 3 Greenhouse Gas Emissions (GHGe), achieving a reduction of at least 2.1% of GHGe each year, resulting in a minimum decrease of 25.7% by 2027 and 46.2% by 2037 (using 2015 as the base year). The Company has met the previous three voluntary GHG reduction targets set. The Scope 3 emissions of business travel and employee commuting are covered in the current target, as well as the previous three targets. The Hartford is not eligible for setting a science based target based on the fact that it qualifies as a financial institution, but our targets are intended to satisfy the science-based target criteria. The Hartford reduced its GHGe by 53 % in 2020, achieving our medium-term and long-term goals. Through year 5 of our new medium and long-term targets, emissions have been reduced by 66 percent compared with the 2015 target base year. Therefore, the medium-term and long-term targets are complete. Note: The Hartford's Scope 3 emissions included in the existing goals above are those generated from employee commuting and business travel. A comprehensive review of the company's full scope 3 emissions was completed in 2020. The results are included in this survey and these emissions will be considered when developing future goals"

"Our Group has set a goal of halving CO2 emissions (compared to FY2013) in the domestic power generation business in FY2025.As a concrete effort in ''making decarbonized electricity” on the supply side, we are working to operate our nuclear power plants with the highest priority given to safety, further develop and utilize renewable energy, and maintain and improve the thermal efficiency of our thermal power plants."
"In December 2020, we were the first large toy company to announce a Science Based Target, which commits us to reduce our absolute carbon emissions by 37% by 2032 from a base year of 2019. This covers emissions from our own operations which equates to roughly 10% of total emissions and includes energy use in our owned and operated stores, our factories and offices, and from our supply chain which equates to almost 90% of emissions including areas such as raw materials and distribution i.e. the target coverage includes 100% of scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions. The target has been approved by the Science Based Target initiative as consistent with levels required to keep global warming to below 1.5°C, the most ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement.The LEGO Group plans to progress towards this target through a supplier engagement target, covering purchased goods, materials and capital goods suppliers, to encourage said suppliers to set an SBT. We will also commit to increasing the percentage of our annual sourcing of renewable electricity to 100% in 2032."
"The Navigator Company has the goal to reduce its absolute ETS CO2 fossil emissions by 86% in 2035 regarding 2018 values, from Industrial Complexes. This means reducing absolute CO2 emissions from 769 kt CO2 in 2018 to around 108 kt CO2 in 2035. The remaining emissions (not avoidable emissions) will be offset through forestry projects. The Company is eager to contribute directly to attaining the global targets set for climate change, and is committed to achieving carbon neutrality at its industrial complexes by 2035. This target is integrated in the Navigator's 2030 Roadmap, under the commitment to invest in low carbon solutions leading to carbon neutrality."

"In 2018, we set emission reduction goals that were aligned with strategies designed to address the long-term reduction of GHG emissions and our commitment to a leadership role in developing solutions that make technological and economic sense. The goals established in 2018 were to reduce GHG emissions by 50% (from 2007 levels) by 2030 and to achieve low-to-no GHG emissions by 2050. These are enterprise-wide goals that encompass the Scope 1 emissions from our electric and natural gas operations. In 2020, we revised our long-term goal to achieve net zero GHG emissions by 2050. The goals are informed by the results of our integrated resource plans, which are designed to plan for an appropriate mix of generation resources to meet energy and capacity needs at a reasonable cost for our customers. These goals are also consistent with actions needed to potentially limit the global average temperature rise to less than 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial times--see EPRI's ''Grounding Decisions: A scientific foundation for companies considering global climate scenarios and greenhouse gas goals” and ''Review of 1.5°C and Other Newer Global Emissions Scenarios: Insights for Company and Financial Climate Low-Carbon Transition Risk Assessment and Greenhouse Goal Setting” reports.  Southern Company will continue to use a portfolio approach as we seek to decarbonize. We expect our path to net zero to be comprised of several key elements: continued coal transition, utilization of natural gas to enable the fleet transition, further growth in our portfolio of zero-carbon resources, negative carbon solutions, enhanced energy efficiency initiatives, and continued investment in R&D focused on clean energy technologies. Our approach is driven by thoughtful scenario planning, long-term integrated resource plans, and constructive regulatory decision-making. We are also engaging with policymakers, customers, and other stakeholders to support outcomes that lead to a net zero future."

"This target was formulated using the science based target setting tool (v. 1.1) and is in line with keeping Thermo Fisher's portion of global GHG emissions under the 2 degrees Celsius cap. The absolute contraction approach was used within the tool to calculate the target. Thermo Fisher made good progress toward our 30% reduction target in 2019 but due to production increases in 2020 due to our COVID-19 pandemic response we were unable to  continue our reduction of emissions as planned. However, due to transition from fossil-fuel generated electricity  to renewable sources at our U.K. and Germany sites we were able to blunt the impact of our production increases on emissions. While our revenue rose  over 25% in 2020 our emissions did not as evidenced in the numbers above."

"This target applies to production facilities and warehouses which covered 98.6% of Thule Group total Scope 1 and 2 emissions in the base year (2014).  In 2020, greenhouse gas emissions from our facilities decreased by 76%  compared with our 2014 base year (base year emissions exclude site divested in 2018). We have achieved our greenhouse gas emission target for 2020. Our target can be summarized as : Direct and indirect emissions of greenhouse gases are to decline 65% in relative produced quantities at our production facilities by the end of 2020, compared to the base year of 2014.We are driving emissions reductions within our own production facilities mainly by increasing the production efficiency (investing in new efficient technology and automated technology), using/completing final transitions to LED lights which are motion or light-sensing, using/planning future solar panel installations, finalizing transition to electric forklift trucks, and increasing the use of renewable energy and certified renewable electricity.In the autumn of 2020, the Board and management of Thule Group decided to commit to the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) – a global standard for climate targets stemming from the goal of the Paris Agreement to prevent the earth's average temperature rising by more than 1.5° C.

"To achieve the highest impact on the thyssenkrupp carbon footprint, to further expand business opportunities and to reduce risks our program Climate Action Program for Sustainable Solutions (CAPS) focuses on three pillars #IMPLEMENT existing solutions, #ENABLE our customers and #ENGAGE stakeholders.Since 2018, we have been working on defining accompanying long and mid-term GHG reduction targets in line with the Paris Agreement and most recent climate science. thyssenkrupp strives to become climate neutral by 2050 in its own operations (scope 1 & 2) and the whole value chain (scope 3). We have also committed ourselves to the following mid-term targets, which have been approved by the SBTi:#IMPLEMENT: thyssenkrupp commits to reduce 30% of its absolute scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 2030 from a 2018 base year.The pillar #IMPLEMENT summarizes the measures we can take in our own operations to work towards climate neutrality. In order to reduce our scope 1 & 2 emissions by 30% we have identified four main levers. We will continue to work on improving our energy efficiency in course of our well-established Groupwide Energy Efficiency Program (GEEP) and increase the generation of green electrical power for own consumption. We will transform our steel production from a blast furnace technology towards hydrogen-based direct reduction plants & electric arc furnaces by 2050. Another approach for carbon direct avoidance already implemented today is to partly replace coke as a reduction agent in the Blast Furnace by hydrogen and thus reduce CO2 emissions.At the same time in a parallel approach, we want to make waste gases arising during steel production available as raw materials for the production of base chemicals. Key activity here is the cross-industry demonstration project Carbon2Chem, seeking to bring this CCU solution to industry scale for our steel production in Duisburg.Please note: Original base year emissions were 24,000,000 tons CO2e. According to GHG Protocol we adjusted the baseline by including the coke plant Schwelgern (2,110,000 tons CO2e in base year) that was acquired in May 2020 and excluding the divestment Elevator Technology (180,000 tons CO2e in base year), which has been sold in July 2020."

The pillar #ENABLE focuses on ways in which our products, technologies & solutions can support our customers on their way towards climate neutrality. As a vast majority of our scope 3 emissions stems from the use phase of our products, we strive to develop & implement climate-friendly solutions for our most GHG intensive customer sectors especially cement & steel. In both sectors, the application potential for our innovative CCU solutions (such as C2C & Oxyfuel) is significant. They enable our customers to reduce emissions by capturing CO2 from CO2-intensive processes & using it for the production of base chemicals, thereby replacing fossil feedstock. Furthermore, our solutions contribute to the required transformation towards an economy powered to a high extent by renewable energy carriers like hydrogen. With our technologies such as water electrolysis, we contribute to renewable power generation and storage. It is by these measures, backed by cross-Group R&D activities, that we seek to decrease our scope 3 emissions by 16% until 2030.Note: Covered emissions in reporting year is already below target due to the impact of the pandemic on the economic environment. For this reason, the target status is still underway."

"This target applies to Italian operations TIM SA The emissions taken into consideration are and indirect emissions due to purchase and consumption of electrical energy (Scope2). The target is in line with an ambitious Group target: becoming Carbon Neutral in 2030. In 2021, TIM started a project to join the SBTi initiative to validate its emissions targets."
"The target is in line with an ambitious Group target: becoming Carbon Neutral in 2030. In 2020, the company managed to reduce its indirect scope 2 emissions by 28% and its combined scope 1 and 2 (carbon neutral target) emissions by 30% ( not only 25%), taking into account the purchase of carbon credits to offset scope 1 emissions, which reinforces the emissions reduction initiatives. In order to complement the company's internal efforts, since 2014 TIM has invested in the purchase of carbon credits to offset part of its emissions. In the Scope 1 , the TIM sought to gain more in-depth understanding of this question by calculating its carbon footprint, a study which measures a product or service's specific GHG emissions during the course of its life cycle. The analysis showed that each 1 Mb of data transmitted over 4G technology results in an emission of 1.47 g of CO2 e. The major stages affected in the company's operations are related to burning diesel in generators and consuming electricity.In the Scope 2, there was a reduction due to lower electricity consumption in 2020.In 2021, TIM started a project to join the SBTi initiative to validate its emissions targets."

"Abs2 is aligned with Goal 13, Climate Action: UN Sustainable Development Goals. Abs2 is also aligned with science-based target setting, specifically using the sectoral decarbonization approach - we completed unofficial validation of this target with SBTi."
"This target includes all of TC Transcontinental operational facilities. Our printing and packaging plants use electricity and fossil fuels to operate their production equipment and to heat, ventilate and cool buildings. Each year, electricity, natural gas, and propane consumption data from our business units is used to calculate our Scope 1 (direct emissions from owned or controlled sources) and Scope 2 (indirect emissions from the generation of purchased energy) emissions. The COVID-19 pandemic significantly affected our operations in 2020 and is reflected in our annual greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The decrease is notably attributable to the temporary closure of some of our printing facilities in Canada. The marked reduction in GHGs in 2020 is therefore mainly caused by the effects of the COVID19 pandemic on our operations. To better understand the variations in our GHG emissions, we began a relative analysis of our GHG emissions in 2020, linking them to our production volumes. This new KPI will now be reported annually in our CSR Progress Reports."

Decarbonisation strategy is based on developing a carbon free production process (inert cell design) within the next decade, scaling up this technology to industrial scale and successively replacing the existing conventional process technology of our electrolysis plants by this technology from 2035 – 2050.Targeted CO2 mitigation timeline is:2020 – 2035:643,000 - constant, possibly slightly increasing to production Increase 2040:586,000 t due to beginning replacement of carbon emitting process technology by carbon free technology  (target coverage appr. 9%)2045:320,000 t due to ongoing replacement (target coverage appr. 50%)2050:0 t due to replacement accomplished (target coverage 100%)"
"Reduction of CO2 emissions from the electricity mix by using CO2-free electricity from renewable energy sources (i.e. based on long term PPAs). The total potential for replacing conventional CO2-laden baseload electricity is (270 MW + 160 MW + 210MW) x 8,600 h = 5,504,000 MWhMultiplied by the CO2 factor of the avoided grey electricity (target set year 2019), the CO2 savings result in: 2,207,104 t CO2.The target fulfilment contribution in 2020 (referred to full decarbonisation in 2050 according to Paris 1.5 target) is appr. 21 % (52.4% x 40%/100%) due to an improved energy mix in Germany. An additional reduction based on PPAs could not be achieved due to the fact that, both the regulatory framework and the competitiveness of the offshore wind power to be used were not given. Necessary conditions are:1) No penalties on grid fees in case of flexible electricity demand.2) Granting of CO2-compensation in the ETS also on green electricity.3) Internationally competitive prices for offshore PPA (Power Purchase Agreements)."
"The aim is to reduce CO2 emissions from the natural gas-fired melting furnaces till 2035 to ‘0' in three steps:a) Step 1: Replacing natural gas by high hydrogen synthetic gas coming from a coke processing plant in the neighbourhood.b) Step 2:  Up to 50% by allowing the furnaces to be operated alternately with (surplus) electricity from renewable energy sources and natural gas after conversion to bivalent operation.It is estimated that the furnaces converted by 2035 can be operated with up to 50% electricity and thus save up to 50% of the previous natural gas emissions.c) Step3:  Replacing this synthetic gas by green hydrogen as soon as available to affordable cost, finally resulting in a carbon free furnace operation powered by surplus green power and green hydrogen.The target fulfilment in 2020 is 0 %, as this target was only set in 2020 and the necessary conversion of the smelting furnaces has not yet begun. Time schedule for conversion process is as follows:- The Replacement of natural gas by high hydrogen synthetic gas is planned till 2024.- The start of the conversion project with a first pilot furnace is planned for 2028. - Conversion of all furnaces (17 in total) to bivalent operation should be completed by 2035 (target coverage up to 50%).- Replacement of synthetic gas by green hydrogen till 2035 (target coverage 100%)."
"This is a medium time-frame science-based target. For a science-based target, the minimum reduction required is 49% absolute emissions reduction from 2010 to 2050. This translates to a linear 1.23% reduction per year on average (-49%/40 years = -1.23%/year) or a 1.7% compounded year-on-year reduction rate.  This target is consistent with the minimum reduction requirements by 2050. Please see ABS 2 for our long-term science-based target.  Trinseo began work on this target in 2018."

This target was initially set with the objective to reduce TSA's overall CO2e over the next 5 years as part of TSA's Pathway to Net Zero plan. however TSA was able to achieve carbon neutral certification for all Australia in late 2020. As a result the sustainability committee is currently reassessing target with a view to setting Net-Zero science based targets.
"The Saitama Plant in Japan is developing GHG reduction targets based on the Saitama Prefectural Ordinance for Promotion of Measures to Cope with Global Warming.As a third period, the reduction target for FY2020-2,024 is 20% reduction compared to FY2015, and activities are underway to achieve the target.?The conversion factor was unified with the numerical value designated by Saitama Prefecture."
"Our company launched an initiative in 2017 to reduce GHG emissions at our factories in Japan, including the Saitama factory, by 30% of the 2013 levels by 2030. Rather than use the intensive unit of net sales, we are using the more ambitious target of reducing the absolute amount.  In Apr. 2021, the company  reconsidered this long-term target and expanded the scope of its activities globally by setting targets at overseas sites as well.?Domestic sites: Reduce by 30% in fiscal year 2025 compared to fiscal year 2013, and by 46% in fiscal year 2030 compared to fiscal year 2013.???Overseas sites: Reduce by 20% or more in fiscal year 2025 compared to fiscal 2018, and by 30% or more in fiscal year 2030 compared to fiscal year 2018.??"

WTW emission gC02e/tkm was 1013.48 and the target for our year would be 644.69 which would need a 36.39% However according to the file we did not meet this goal this year.  We had a score of 2.07 but I can not get the caluculator to do this.
TTW emission - metric tonnes of CO2eq.  Base year 5945.602 for base year.  Target year of 2030 is 5482.090.28.  We would need a reduction of 7.80 a year to meet our target.
"This target covers Scope 1 and 2 emissions from all our sites and facilities. The SBTi has approve our intensity targets, but we also have absolute targets that we hope to achieve soon. 2020 was a different year due to the pandemic, so even if we achieved the target, we will keep using it in the following years, when the production of steel increases again to past years' levels."

"Tullow Oil has committed to becoming a Net Zero company by 2030 on its Scope 1 and 2 emissions. In 2020 we set out to define a decarbonisation plan and determine a timeframe for our Net Zero commitment. These decarbonisation efforts will set Tullow on a path to reduce emissions on a net equity basis by 40 per cent relative to a 2020 baseline. Further identified emissions reduction actions can reduce emissions by an additional 5 per cent. Carbon offsetting will also be required to achieve a carbon neutral or Net Zero status, and work is underway to determine the right carbon offset strategy for Tullow. Our residual hard to abate emissions – largely from power generation on the FPSOs – will be offset via nature-based carbon removal programmes focused in our key countries of operation. We will be looking to invest in new carbon offset projects in our key countries of operations over the next decade in order to offset our residual net equity emissions of ~600,000 tonnes of CO2e. As we intend to be the key investors of new projects, we will build this portfolio slowly with a view to be carbon neutral from 2030 onwards. Tullow has agreed the strategic objectives of its carbon offset programme with the Board and in 2021 will work to identify suitable projects for investment."
"When setting the absolute reduction targets, the Company calculates the reduction target using the SBTi-Tool (sectoral decarbonization approach (SDA) SDA_Tool_v1.2.1) provided by the Science Based Target Initiative as the scientific foundation. With 2005 as the base year, short-term (2023) and medium-term (2030) reduction targets are set similar to those of the GHG reduction pathways of Taiwan's NDC (i.e., the reduction targets are 2% less than in the base year of 2005 for 2020, 10% less than in the base year for 2025, and 20% less than in the base year for 2030). Our actual GHG emission target of year 2023 is 776,736 MtCO2e."

"To be more efficient in every aspect of banking activity, the Bank went through a major relocation as it moved its headquarters where it left the 2 big office buildings in Ankara for one in Istanbul. The office building is a newer building available for developing new projects in the progress of reducing climate impacts. To seize this opportunity, we set a target to reduce our scope 1 and 2 emissions. This target is achieved. Our natural gas consumption decreased 35% and electricity consumption decreased 16%. Our new office building which we are moved in 2019, is a newer building available for developing new projects in the progress of reducing climate impacts so we are working on studies reduction of energy consumption and emission. As we mentioned in the initiatives implemented in C4.3b; the Bank has established an Environmental Management System (EMS) in 2010 and in order to further improve the inclusiveness of the management system, the Bank has started the necessary studies for the transition to an integrated management system in 2020. Also, in 2020, we continued to carry out energy-saving works in our headquarters to reduce our electricity consumption. Unnecessary lighting in office work areas on floors has been turned off. Parking lot lighting has been reduced by maintaining the illuminance level and turned into LED armatures. Fire escape lightings have been converted to LED armatures. With this investment, we saved 76,819 kWH annually and prevented 38 tons of CO2e emissions. The resulting comparison of emission amount came out to be a 26% year-on-year decrease. We have successfully achieved our 5% emission reduction target in 2020 compared to 2019. Also, in September 2020, Bank's Sustainability Committee was established. The committee convenes at least four times a year within the scope of its duties, powers and responsibilities. The Committee was planned in 2020 to declare Science-Based Target on reducing greenhouse gas emissions for 2021."

"In April 2017 we obtained the related tools from SBTi and began creating scenarios on which to base our targets. After revising our targets through several rounds of communication with SBTi, both parties reached an agreement in May 2018. With 2016 as the reference year, we set 2030 targets of a 34% reduction in overall Scope 1 and 2 emissions and an 18% reduction in overall Scope 3 emissions.When we set the targets, the results of five countries, namely, Japan, China, India, Indonesia, and Thailand were used, but the results of Taiwan, Vietnam, the United States, and Brazil were added in 2020.We are currently reviewing the targets as we now use the data from broader sources and shoot for 1.5? goal.Concerning electricity, we have set a new target of using 100% renewable electric sources by 2030."
"As part of its work with the SBTi in 2020, the Group has set a target covering GHG emissions from the operations under the Group's direct control (Scopes 1 and 2). In addition to its existing Better Places 2030 carbon reduction targets, the Group commits to reduce absolute emissions from Scopes 1 & 2 by -65% between 2015 and 2030.This new target has been approved by the SBTi, in connection with the target to reduce absolute Scopes 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions by -50% by 2030 from a 2015 base year, with a 1.5°C pathway alignment, the most ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement (minimum 4.2% linear annual reduction from 2015 to 2030).This strong performance in 2020 was due to:• The accomplished transition towards electricity from renewable sources under the Better Places 2030 programme,• A continued improvement in the energy efficiency level of the owned and managed shopping centres portfolio• The impact of the COVID-19 health crisis, which resulted in restrictions affecting most of the year and an average closure period for the Group's assets of 93 days (the Group was only able to operate at full capacity for 70 days in 2020).SBTI:URW's target submission has a combined scope 1, 2 and 3 absolute target which translates to an absolute emissions reduction for scope 1 and 2 of 63%  by 2030 from a 2015 base year, which meets the minimum ambition for 1.5 C pathway defined by the absolute contraction approach and is therefore considered ambitious. Furthermore, the scope 3 portion of the combined scope 1, 2 and 3 absolute target translates to an absolute emissions reduction of 50% by 2030 from a 2015 base year, which exceeds the minimum ambition defined by the Absolute Contraction approach and is therefore also considered ambitious"
"In 2016, Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield decided to accelerate its CSR and climate commitment by setting a CSR long term strategy: ''Better Places 2030” in continental Europe. This strategic roadmap was structured around the target of cutting the Group's carbon footprint by 50% by 2030 (relative to 2015 levels), encompassing its entire value chain (scopes 1, 2 and 3). In doing so, the Group was the first listed real estate company to incorporate CSR in its entire value chain and address the wide scope of indirect carbon emissions resulting from construction works, transportation of visitors and employees, and energy consumption by tenants.Target status  : revisedIn 2020, the total carbon emissions of 2015 baseline have been updated to include methodology improvements. Due to an error identified on the ''area served with energy” denominator, corrections have been performed on 2015, 2018 and 2019  figures. Moreover, for the calculation of ''Downstream Leased Assets”, the gross leasable area ratios of ''dining” and ''non-dining” activities of tenants were updated in 2020. This update improves the precision of the results as it replaces estimations that were done for years 2019 and 2015.  The total GHG emissions of the Group increased by +1.9% for 2015 and +1.0% for 2019.This strong performance in 2020 was due to:• The accomplished transition towards electricity from renewable sources under the Better Places 2030 programme,• A continued improvement in the energy efficiency level of the owned and managed shopping centres portfolio• The impact of the COVID-19 health crisis, which resulted in restrictions affecting most of the year and an average closure period for the Group's assets of 93 days (the Group was only able to operate at full capacity for 70 days in 2020).SBTI:URW's target submission has a combined scope 1 2 and 3 absolute target which translates to an absolute emissions reduction for scope 1 and 2 of 63% by 2030 from a 2015 base year, which meets the minimum ambition for 1.5 C pathway defined by the absolute contraction approach and is therefore considered ambitious.

"This target is a continuation of Abs1 reported in 2020. Unilever committed to reduce scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions 100% by 2030 from a 2015 base year. This target has been approved by the Science Based Targets Initiative as meeting the 1.5 degree C warming scenario. We will achieve the target through: 1) reducing intensity of energy consumption and 2) use of 100% renewable energy for all residual energy requirements. During 2020, the fifth year of this target, we reduced absolute scope 1+2 emissions by 29.4% vs 2019, with scope 1 emissions reducing by 7.9% and scope 2 emissions reducing by 61.3%."
"This is a shorter term, interim target towards target Abs 2 which has been approved by the Science-Based Targets initiative as being 1.5C aligned. Having achieved 70% reduction in scope 1+2 emissions by 2025, this will revert to target Abs 2 which aims to achieve 100% reduction by 2030.During 2020, the fifth year of this target, we reduced absolute scope 1+2 emissions by 29.4% vs 2019, with scope 1 emissions reducing by 7.9% and scope 2 emissions reducing by 61.3%."
"This target is a continuation of Abs 2, with a long-term timeframe to maintain operational emissions at zero beyond 2030. This means any changes in operations following 2030 will need to be aligned with zero operational emissions."

A medium term science based target of 46% redcution on a 2019 baseline was recomended by the Carbon Trust and this translates to 4.6% reduction per year.The targets covers scope 1 and scope 2 emissions and we plan to braoden the scopes to cover scope 3 in the a year or two years time."
"A joint interim target (with Fortum) to reduce total carbon emissions from European generation by at least 50% compared to a 2019 baseline. We do not understand ""anticipate"" as a commitment, but we see this as the option which best represents our current assessment on SBTi."
"In March 2020, Uniper announced the aim for the power generation business in Europe to be carbon-neutral by 2035. The target includes scope 1 emissions as well as scope 2 emissions for reporting from 2021. We do not understand ""anticipate"" as a commitment, but we see this as the option which best represents our current assessment on SBTi."
"Uniper aims for the entire group to be carbon-neutral by 2050 in scopes 1, 2 and 3 emissions. This goal is aligned to meet the Paris Agreement targets. As part of this effort, Uniper will define a scope 3 target in 2021."
''We plan to adapt the targets according to the SBTi-Framework ''FINANCIAL SECTOR SCIENCE-BASED TARGETS GUIDANCE (pilot version 04/2021). This would include scope 3 emissions for our investments and an almost complete coverage of scope 1 & 2 emissions (only up to 5% may be excluded). To meet these requirements we have to work on additional data to be reported and align metrics and valuation techniques. Consequently the scope of our targets will be enlarged and our targets will be standardized by referencing to the Paris-aligned climate pathways. ”
For CDP 2022 we anticipate achieving the 75% reduction as compared to our base year of 2006 in GHG  associated with Scope 1 and 2 emissions.  During CY 2022 we will be evaluating establishing a science based target and a new goal potentially  with being carbon neutral
"This target has been calculated using the SBTI SDA tool for ""Services - Buildings"", and the ""Fixed Market Share"" projected output measure, and the ETP B2DS SDA scenario, for Scope 1 and Scope 2 (as defined by SBTI, with only grid electricity in scope 2, and district heat in scope 1). We have then transformed this into a 1.5DegC target by multiplying it by the ratio of the 1.5DegC/2DegC 2030 CRREM GHG targets for ""Residential Buildings, Multi Family"" trajectories.  We have then combined the scope 1 and scope 2 targets to form an overall scope 1 and 2 target.  This target has been submitted to the SBTI for verification but not yet verified.   This target applies to our whole operations."
"This target has been calculated using the SBTI SDA tool for ""Services - Buildings"", and the ""Fixed Market Share"" projected output measure, and the ETP B2DS SDA scenario, for Scope 1  (as defined by SBTI, so including both direct emissions for natural gas use, but also district heat consumption which under GHG Protocol rules would normally be considered Scope 2). We have then transformed this into a 1.5DegC target by multiplying it by the ratio of the 1.5DegC/2DegC 2030 CRREM GHG targets for ""Residential Buildings, Multi Family"" trajectories.

"This target is for net zero scope 1+2(market based) GHG emissions by 2030.  This follows the UK GBC guidance and definitions of net zero carbon, taking account of actual reductions in scope 1+2(market based) GHG emissions achieved through energy consumption reduction, on site renewable energy generation, purchasing of REGO certified renewable electricity (that meets the triple criteria of 100% renewable source, energy attributes, and additionality), and finally offsetting using certified carbon offsets for any residual carbon emissions in order to achieve net zero GHG emissions."
"This target is for net zero scope 3 category 2(new construction) GHG emissions by 2030.  This follows the UK GBC guidance and definitions of net zero carbon, taking account of actual reductions in embodied carbon of new constructions through design optimisation, material selection, waste reduction, construction site impact reduction, and finally offsetting using certified carbon offsets for any residual carbon emissions in order to achieve net zero GHG emissions.  Note that to avoid double-counting of emissions, embodied carbon for the purposes of this target relates to ""cradle to PC + end of life"" (RIBA stages A1-A5 and C1-C4), and excludes operational emissions (RIBA stages B1-B7) as these are already captured within our Scope 1+2 target (as under our all-inclusive billing model, all tenant energy use is part of Unite Students overall scope 1+2 GHG emissions)."
"United is pledging to become 100% green by reducing its GHG emissions by 100% by 2050. United, which in 2018 became the first U.S. airline to commit to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 50% by 2050, will advance towards carbon neutrality by continuing its leadership in advancing the sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) market and by making a multimillion-dollar investment in revolutionary atmospheric carbon capture technology known as Direct Air Capture (DAC) – rather than indirect measures like carbon offsetting. The planned investment will support the construction of the largest DAC plant in the world, capable of capturing up to 1 million tons of CO2 directly from the atmosphere every year. This plant is the first of its kind in the U.S. and is expected to capture as much CO2 as the work of 40 million trees."
"In 2015, United made a $30 million equity investment in Fulcrum BioEnergy, whose sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is to be derived from municipal solid waste and is expected to have a greater than 80% reduction in lifecycle GHG emissions. This interim target supports the U.S. airline industry goal—as announced earlier this year by the U.S. airline trade association, Airlines for America—to make 2 billion gallons of SAF available to U.S. operators by 2030. United has a long-term supply agreement with Fulcrum for 90 million gallons of SAF per year for a minimum of 10 years, but this supply has not yet begun."
"This target covers 100% operations and accounts for 100% scope 1 + scope 2 emissions at reporting boundary at UMC. The reduction target is 100% in 2050, equal to 1,826,569 metric tonnes CO2e.Gross Scope (1+2)  emissions was 1,826,569 metric tonnes CO2e in the base year 2020.The target is underway."
"This target covers 100% operations and accounts for 78% of scope 1 emissions  at reporting boundary at UMC. The reduction target is 50% in 2025, equal to 306,236 metric tonnes CO2e.

This target for 42% reduction by 2030 was published in 2020 within our annual reporting. The emissions baseline however has been restated this year (for the emissions from 2019/20) to take into consideration some improvements to emissions calculations ( to align better with IPCC guidance 2019).We committed to setting science based targets in November 2020 and submitted our targets to SBTi for validation on May 20th 2021.  The approval of our targets was published by the SBTI on 15th July 2021.

"In 2019, we committed to the UN's Business Ambition for 1.5°C pledge to pursue science-based measures to limit global temperature rise to 1.5°C. UPM is uniquely positioned to reach carbon neutrality by climate-positive land use, reduced emissions and climate-positive products.We made a systematic global review of our opportunities for reducing emissions using existing technologies. We have also analysed the financial impact of each carbon action. Based on this assessment we tightened our previous target (Int 1 from 2018 CDP disclosure) and committed to reduce our CO2 emissions from fuels and purchased electricity by 65% from 2015 level by 2030. The new target was approved by the Science-Based Targets initiative to be aligned with 1.5°C pathway."
"Uponor's Scope 1 & 2 accounting covers emissions from manufacturing sites and warehouse operations. Target coverage is company-wide. Uponor headquarters and sales offices are excluded since related emissions from the use of facilities are deemed immaterial (also excluded from SBTi targets).Scope 1: Uponor's Scope 1 emissions arise mainly from stationary combustion of fuels related to heating of manufacturing and warehouse premises, and mobile combustion of trucks, forklifts and other vehicles at the production sites and warehouses.Scope 2: Energy consumption related emissions arise mainly from purchased electricity from grid and to a smaller extent from purchased district heat.Uponor has delivered the calculations to SBTi organisation in December 2020, and received an approval from the Science Based Targets initiative to its new greenhouse gas emission reduction targets in April 2021. The new targets are based on the Paris Climate Agreement and aim to limit the global temperature rise to 1.5°C.A mistake was noticed in our sustainability data system in 2021. A preliminary evaluation shows that the impact is minor and concerns mainly scope 2 figures. The mistake will be investigated thoroughly, and the figures will be corrected, also including time series, by the end of 2021."

"In 2016 we established a goal to reduce absolute GHG emissions 12 percent by 2025 throughout our global ground operations. This goal built on our ongoing efforts to achieve a 20 percent reduction in GHG intensity by 2020, which we continued to measure and report. In 2020, UPS broadened our Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) vision and built a road map on three generations of sustainability goals. Announced in June of 2021, the environmental sustainability goal is to  achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. The road map to carbon neutrality by 2050 includes the following targets:By 2025*25% renewable electricity for facilities (existing goal).*40% alternative fuel purchases as a percent of total ground fuel (existing goal).By 2035*30% sustainable aviation fuel.*100% renewable electricity for facilities.*50% reduction in CO2 per package delivered for global small package (2020 baseline).The use of renewable energy will be critical to reaching this absolute emissions reduction target. This  goal will advance our commitment to alternative fuels and technologies."
"In 2020, we were working to achieve a 1% reduction in electricity consumption across our enrichment plants compared to the previous year, a target we have had in place since 2013 to reduce our climate impact.  This is one of the Key Performance Indicators monitored by our Board Sustainability Committee. Our enrichment plants are responsible for 99% of our total electricity usage, which in 2020 accounted for 93% of total emissions associated with our direct operations. Our targets have previously been expressed in energy terms, rather than emissions terms, as this was easily operationalised by our energy managers and was not affected by changes in the national grid emissions factors. However, in 2020 we began work on setting a Group-wide target expressed in terms of carbon emissions. This complements our work to raise awareness of the role of nuclear energy in the low carbon energy transition. It also supports our efforts to understand value chain impacts, engage employees on climate issues, and broaden our carbon management focus to consider F-gas usage options and low carbon energy choices alongside reducing our overall energy usage. Our work in 2020 to model our future emissions profile and understand our scope 3 climate impacts culminated in early 2021 with the approval of our new target to achieve net zero by 2040."
"The base year and target year are based on the natural year, and the emission reduction target is: by December 31, 2021, the global greenhouse gas emissions will be reduced by 2% compared with 2020. This goal can be achieved by improving energy efficiency, reducing the use of air conditioning, saving electricity, or purchasing renewable energy products."
"Vaisala decided in 2015 to set an ambitious target of running the whole company globally with electricity from only renewable sources by the year 2020, and we achieved the target on schedule. This has an impact on our Scope 2 emissions, on which the target of 90% reduction from the baseline year was set and beyond achieved (the total reduction being 97%). The achievement covers all Scope 2 emissions from manufacturing facilities, R&D and service centers, and sales offices, including the acquisitions made in 2018. Micro-offices in leased facilities, such as office hotels, make up less than 2% of the Group's total Scope 2 emissions and are excluded from the scope as insignificant."
"Our Base year Targets have been set in Financial Year FY20  (April 2019-March 2020) therefore mentioned Year Target set as Financial Year 2021 (April 2020 - March 2021)Our greenhouse gas emission reduction program is rigourously monitored and cross-checked with our targets.

"Net-zero commitment and interim science-based emissions reduction targets: Our company has committed a long-term target to reach net-zero value chain emissions by no later than 2035, alongside science-based targets across all relevant scopes and in line with the criteria and recommendations of the Science Based Targets initiative"
"In 2019, the company published a group of sustainability goals, including new commitments to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, bolder than goals established previously in 2018, aiming to become a net zero mining company:• To reduce the absolute emission of scopes 1 and 2 by 33% by 2030, aligned with the Paris Agreement's objective of limiting global warming to below 2ºC. This goal was defined based on the calculation tool of the Science Based Target Initiative (SBTI), and is therefore a level compatible with the limitation of the increase in global temperature of less than 2°C (scenario well below 2°C) and considered a science-based target.•To become net zero (scope 1 and 2) by 2050;•To adopt a shadow price of USD 50 per ton of CO2 equivalent, to be used in the economic feasibility studies of projects;•To adopt a shadow price of USD 10 a ton of CO2 equivalent for carbon sequestration in forest restoration and reforestation projects;•To establish ambition to reduce scope 3 emissions.Scope 1 direct emissions and Scope 2 indirect emissions Market-based totaled around 10.3 million tons of CO? equivalent in 2020, a reduction of 14.9% in relation to the previous year and of 27.2% in regards to 2017, the base year of Scope 1 and 2 reduction goal. The reduction in total emissions observed between 2019 and 2020 is due, especially, to the fact that the company still has a reflection in production volume as a result of the Brumadinho dam collapse and the Covid-19 pandemic effects. However, the emissions intensity per ton of iron ore equivalent in 2020 was 25.9 kg CO?e/t MFe-eq. It was slightly lower than the intensity in the year 2017, which was 26.6 kg CO?e/t MFe-eq. This shows that Vale's emissions profile is still strongly correlated to production, despite a marginal improvement in energy intensity. The company's emissions are also expected to peak by 2023, due to the 400 Mtpa expected production of iron ore capacity by the end of 2022. Thereafter, the absolute emission reduction trajectory and its consequent decouple from the production process will occur with the implementation of the new initiatives of larger scale emission reduction under development."
"Vale's scope 3 emissions, annually calculated and verified by independent third parties, represents 98% of its total emissions and are not under its direct control. In 2020, Vale committed to a target to reduce scope 3 net emissions by 15% until 2035, with 2018 as baseline, which are based on development of new products, nature-based solutions, partnership and engagement with clients and suppliers. The scope 3 target will be revised every five year, given the uncertainties regarding low carbon technologies and climate policies. Both targets are aligned with the Paris Agreement ambition. The fall in Scope 3 emissions by 18% in 2020 compared to 2018 (base year), is due to the reduction in sales, especially pellets by 27.7% and iron ore by 5.4%, justified by the production decrease and Vale's emissions profile strongly correlated to production. Despite of the 18% of reduction in Scope 3 achieved in 2020, Scope 3 emissions are expected to increase due to the production levels growth to ~400 Mtpa of iron ore."

"As Vallourec's industrial footprint changed considerably between 2008 and 2017 it was decided to determine its intrinsic energy performance from 2018 compared to base yr 2017.New objectives for 2025 based on new assumptions and based on the Group's new scope. They were examined to measure whether Vallourec's emissions pathway could fit within the SBT approach by 2025.Vallourec decided to join the Science-Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) in late 2018.  A first submission form was sent in the Q2 2019 leading to the validation of Sc 1 and 2 emission reduction ambitions for year 2025 (base yr 2017). In 03/2020, Vallourec requested the formal validation of revised goals for 2025 including Sc3 emissions.

"Because our previous absolute target (-2% yoy in the period 2011-2018) was a succes (we realised a reduction of 38%), we decided to revise our target to -2.5% yoy for the period 2018-2025. This new target implies that we aim to reduce our absolute emissions (scope 1+2+upstream3) from 4,679 ton (2018) to 3,919 ton (2025) being a reduction of 760 ton (16.2%).In our own organisation, our absolute carbon emissions in 2020 totalled 1,965 tonnes, or 1.17 tonnes per FTE (2019: 4,220 tonnes, or 2.4 tonnes per FTE). The 51.1% fall in emissions per FTE is mainly the result of less business travel due to the one-off impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.Because of these exceptional circumstances, we more than met our reduction target of 2.5% per FTE per year, but it is likely that emissions will increase again once the situation normalises. In 2020, we continued to offset all the carbon emissions from our own organisation, as we did in 2019. Through our membership at Platform for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF) - which consists of twelve Dutch financial institutions who have agreed to work together to jointly develop open source methodologies to measure the carbon footprint of their investments and loans - we are in the process of establishing a Science Based Target which includes scope 3 (our main impact scope) specifically tailored to the financial sector."
"Despite the success of the previous target 2011-2020, the long-term target has been expanded to 2025 starting from the base year 2015. The aim remains the same, being for a reduction of 2% of our (scope 1+2+3) emissions in the period 2016 to 2025. This new target implies that we aim to reduce our 2015 emissions (5,324 ton) to 4,350 ton in 2025, being a reduction of 974 ton (18.3%).

Target coverage - HZL's Scope 1+2 emissions in 2016 equaled 4,799,273 metric tons of CO2 in 2016 (base year), which forms 14.6% of Vedanta's total base year emissions of 32,906,195 metric tons of CO2 in 2016. SBTi alignment : The targets covering greenhouse gas emissions from company operations (scopes 1 and 2) are approved by SBTI and are consistent with reductions required to keep warming to 2°C .Emission reduction initiatives: HZL has implemented a range of measures to reduce its Scope 1 and 2 emissions. Shifting from open cast mining to underground mining led to a significant saving in the consumption of high speed diesel, which resulted in emissions reductions of more than 68 thousand tonnes of CO2 equivalent in 2018. HZL has also: changed the brush seals of turbines and developed transformer taps to improve energy efficiency and reduce power consumption at all its thermal power plants; optimised the pressure settings of cement bulker-unloading compressors; and established more efficient cooling methods. The company has also advanced low-carbon energy by replacing compressors, switching from liquefied petroleum gas burners to electric heaters, installing LED lights, and modifying discharge lines."

"In 2020, we set new environmental targets, including setting and aligning an emissions target with the Science Based Targets initiative. Based on our company size, we were required to set targets via the Small -and Medium-sized Enterprise (SME)  route (for more details, see: https://sciencebasedtargets.org/resources/files/faqs-for-smes.pdf). The SME route does not allow or require a specific scope 3 emissions target, but rather requires the company to ""measure and reduce"" total scope 3 emissions. Therefore, the target details listed above are unofficial, and are aligned with our SBTi-approved Scope 1 + 2 goal to demonstrate our commitment to reducing overall emissions."

"VERBUND's target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 90 % starting from the basis year 2011 until 2021 includes Scope 1, Scope 2 market-based and parts of Scope 3 emissions calculated for fuels and air travel (2011: 5 million t CO2e). The Science Based Targets Initiative validated this target as science-based in October 2016, and  in 2020 the target for Scope 1 and 2 was categorized as consistent with the 1.5-degree target of the Paris Agreement.This target will be achieved mainly in VERBUND's generation activities:- by the exit from coal power generation in 2020 (Scope 1)- by the switch of energy purchase for operation of power plants from energy of unknown origin to labelled green energy. (Scope 2 market based)- by the reduction of upstream emissions via reduction of fossil fuel purchase for combustion (coal and gas) (Scope 3 emissions from fuels)and reduction of GHG emissions in Scope 3 (emissions from business air travel) in VERBUND's administration:- by travel policies for employees, etc. (Scope 3 emissions from business air travel).In total approximately 99% of GHG emissions are going to be reduced by emission reduction activities listed above. About 1 % of GHG emissions are going to be offset by tools as Clean Development Mechanism CDM, Joint Implementation JI, etc.This target was based on the liquidation of VERBUND Thermal Power, which was planned at the time but not carried out, making an adjustment necessary: the associated targets will be revised in financial year 2021, taking the acquisition of the stake in Gas Connect Austria (GCA) into account as well as a new contract for district heat supply and the continued need to use thermal power plants to maintain the domestic security of supply. VERBUND has succeeded in reducing carbon emissions from the thermal power plants by around 70 % since 2005 and therefore contributes to the avoidance and reduction of emissions and to the achievement of SDG 13 ''Climate action”."

"We acknowledge a significant decrease of our overall Scope1+2 emissions on 2020 vs our base year (2019). However, we have to take into account a -13% of companywide glass manufactured because of the COVID-19 crisis on 2020.VERESCENCE has built its decarbonization scenario based on the absolute contraction approach proposed by SBTi (v1.2.1). This is aiming to decrease yearly our overall CO2e emissions about 2,5% to guarantee our contribution in limiting the global warming well below 2°C by 2050.Then, we target to reduce our emissions from 2019 to 2034 by -40% (vs. -37,5% required by the SBTi WB2C scenario). We are committed to SBTi WB2C scenario since January 2020 and we are about to issue formally our target to SBTi committee before the end of the year. Our roadmap to decrease our CO2 emissions has been validated by our executive committee as well as our board of shareholders."

Therefore, as it is less than 40%, we focus first on setting science-based target dealing with our Scope 1+2 emissions. Nevertheless, purchased goods and services is the Top 1 category of our overall scope 3 emissions (42%). Therefore, we anticipate setting long term goals with our key suppliers who are contributed the most."

"In April 2014, Vermilion closed the acquisition of a small, privately held company (Elkhorn Resources Inc.) with light-oil assets in SE Saskatchewan.  In line with our corporate priority of identifying initiatives that reflect our focus on Health, Safety and Environment, Integrated Sustainability, and Operational Excellence, a target was set in 2014 to reduce flaring and venting emissions from this operation by 50% by 2020. This has resulted in a significant and ongoing focus on the reduction of flaring and vented solution gas at these sites.Beginning in 2015 and continuing through 2020, the construction of new infrastructure, operational changes, and increased infrastructure runtimes have reduced flaring and venting emissions in our former Elkhorn assets by approximately 88% [1-(Current Year Emissions 22,757.8 tCO2e / Base Year Emissions 193,399.7) = 88.2% reduction]. This reflects an approximately 176% success rate in relation to our 2020 target of a 50% reduction over 2014 emission levels [(193,999.7 – 22,757.8)/(193,999.7 x 50%) = 176%].The target applies to our Canadian Business Unit. This is our final year reporting on this target."
"In May 2018, Vermilion acquired Spartan Energy Corp., a publicly traded oil & gas company headquartered in Calgary, Alberta. A major addition, the acquisition of Spartan resulted in an approximately 30% increase to our Alberta and Saskatchewan production in relation to 2017 totals. Consistent with our corporate on Health, Safety and Environment, Integrated Sustainability and Operational Excellence, and similar to the 2014 Elkhorn acquisition (ABS1), a target was set in 2018 to reduce flaring and venting emissions associated with the Spartan assets by 50% by 2024. Similar to Elkhorn, this reduction is being accomplished through a variety of gas conservation and recovery initiatives including the construction of new infrastructure and implementation of enhanced operational practices and technology.Although not considered to be material in the context of our overall Corporate Scope 1 emissions, as part of ongoing asset evaluations related to the Spartan acquisition a legacy (pre-Vermilion) fuel/flare/vent (FFV) discrepancy was identified in 2020 in relation to a portion of the Spartan assets. Recalculation of the 2018 emissions for these assets has resulted in a downward adjustment (reduction) in the base year emission value from 374,515.8 to 340,926.2. Similarly, the 2018 base year emissions as a % of total base year emissions has also been recalculated and reduced from 73% to 66%.Infrastructure changes and performance optimization activities undertaken by Vermilion subsequent to the Spartan acquisition have reduced flaring and venting emissions from the former Spartan assets by approximately 36.1% [1 – (Current Year Emissions 217,831.1 / Revised Base Year Emissions 340,926.2) = 36.1%]. This reflects an approximately 72% success rate to date in relation to our 2024 target of a 50% reduction over 2018 emission levels [(340,926.2 – 217,831.1) / (340,926.2 x 50%) = 72%].On an annualized basis, flaring and venting emissions from the former Spartan assets were reduced by (240,956 – 217,831) = 23,125 tCO2e between 2019 and 2020. Consistent with the 2018 base year emissions, the 2019 flaring and venting emission value used in this calculation was also been revised to reflect the identified FFV discrepancy.The target applies to our Canadian Business Unit."
"Vertex set a goal of 35% absolute reduction by 2020 for Scope 1+2 GHG emissions, using 2014 as the baseline year.

"A total emissions reduction of 20% is based on increasing emphasis on efficiency for both VIAVI products and business practices.Due to COVID-19 and the impact it had on business travel Scope 1 and 2 remained rather stagnant while scope 3 decreased significantly. We expect 2021 scope 3 to increase significantly because business travel will resume close to 2019 levels.  Viavi is under construction on a new Manufacturing site going live in 2022, in Chandler, AZ. To decrease the impact of C02 we are considering adding solar to the new site. Additionally, we have a commitment to take our Suzhou site 100% renewable in the next two years which will decrease our CO2 by over 2000 tons."
"A specific reduction of Scope 1 emissions by 5% was chosen as a marker for measuring relative progress toward our overall goal of 20% total emissions reduction.Due to multiple M&A's over past few years scope 1 has increased based on Real estate portfolio growth.

To decrease the impact of C02 we are considering adding solar to the new site. Additionally, we have a commitment to take our Suzhou site 100% renewable in the next two years which will decrease our CO2 by over 2000 tons."
A specific reduction of 0% for Scope 3 emissions was chosen as a marker for measuring relative progress toward our overall goal of 20% total emissions reduction as our employee headcount has more than doubled in just the past 5 years.Due to COVID-19 and the impact it had on business travel Scope 1 and 2 remained rather stagnant while scope 3 decreased significantly. We expect 2021 scope 3 to increase slightly and 2022 to increase significantly because business travel will resume close to 2019 levels prior to COVID-19.We are in discussions with our Travel provider to team together to create a net zero carbon travel program. We are in the initial stages of these discussions but have narrowed down 12 projects under our travel provider.
"This carbon emissions reduction target reported is for the current 2020 reporting period, using 2015 as a base year. Vicinity's carbon emissions reduction target of 15 per cent from 2015 was achieved and exceeded this year. Since 2015, Vicinity has reduced overall scope 1+2 carbon emissions by 43 per cent  or over 102,000 tonnes of CO2-e. This was achieved through our energy efficiency program, but also due to a reduction in the number of assets within our portfolio, where since 2015 we reduced our gross lettable area (GLA) by 17 per cent. The methodology for establishing this target included the use of asset specific targets from across the portfolio and aggregating them to form a corporate-wide target. Target setting is a key component of our approach to continuous environmental improvement and achieving the ‘Low carbon smart assets' pillar of our Sustainability strategy.  Vicinity sets annual performance targets to drive continuous improvement across our asset portfolio in key environmental metrics such as energy, carbon emissions, waste and water. Annual energy and emissions reduction targets are informed by Vicinity's long-term internal carbon reduction target. We publicly disclose our annual energy and carbon reduction targets here: http://sustainability.vicinity.com.au/our-business-and-strategy/our-commitments/learn-more/"
"In FY19, Vicinity committed to a Net Zero Carbon Target target by 2030 for our 100% owned assets. The Net Zero target covers the scope 1 and scope 2 carbon emissions from the common mall area of Vicinity's wholly owned centres - that is, the direct emissions within our operational control at these assets.Progress on the target is reported on an Australian Financial Year basis (1 July- 30 June). In the Baseline Year FY16, the scope of the target covered 28% of all scope 1 and scope 2 emission of Vicinity's managed portfolio. In Reporting Year FY20, the scope of target covered 30% of all scope 1 and Scope 2 of Vicinity's managed portfolio. The increase in coverage is the result of divestment of assets since the baseline year/The baseline year for the target is FY16, and is reviewed annually and adjusted based on acquisitions and divestments, in accordance with the guidance within the GHG Protocol. The covered emissions reported above are for FY20 (July 2019 - June 2020).Our Net Zero carbon target will be achieved through energy efficiency programs, and our onsite solar program. Our Net Zero carbon target has short, medium- and long-term targets to monitor how we are progressing against our Net Zero carbon commitment.This target represents our long-term Net Zero target as aligned to Vicinity's business time horizons.  Vicinity has already achieved 31 per cent of the energy reduction requirements for our long term Net Zero carbon target."

"Following more than a decade of success in reducing our carbon emissions (by 20% from 2007 to 2019) we reset our ambition in 2020 by becoming a signatory of UK Sustainable Aviation's commitment to Net Zero CO2 aircraft emissions by 2050; and joining the UK's Jet Zero Council, where the aviation industry is working with the UK Government to remove barriers to decarbonisation. Our emissions in 2020 represents only a third of our reported emissions for 2019. This a direct result of the reduction in our operations due to the Covid 19 pandemic. In the next few years we will expect to see our emission increase again as the aviation industry recovers and we resume full operations, before the improvements we are making to our fleet, operations, and support for new technologies again begin to show again as reductions in our footprint.Currently, the Science Based Target Initiative (SBTi) is at a draft stage release of target setting guidelines for the aviation sector. We are actively monitoring the SBTi's aviation sector target development and will review our position once the final validation criteria is released."

"We are committed to cutting energy consumption and associated greenhouse gas emissions by improving energy efficiency and sourcing energy from renewables. In 2020, Grace established a target to reduce Scope 1 and Scope 2 Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 22% from a 2019 baseline by 2029 resulting in a 2.2% year over year reduction to align with CDP guidance on Science-Based Targets."
"Our new climate target, set in 2020, is to reduce our absolute scope 1 and scope 2 emissions by 30 percent by 2030, using a 2018 baseline. This target follows the medium-term goals of the Paris Climate Agreement. The target is not approved by SBTi, but Grainger is aligning with the SBTi guidance for Scope 1 and Scope 2 (market based). The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has confirmed that in order to limit global warming to 1.5°C, the world needs to halve CO2 emissions by around 2030 and reach net-zero CO2 emissions by no later than 2050. In light of these longer-term goals, we also recognize the need to reduce scope 3 emissions as part of this process. The majority of our scope 3 impact resides in the energy required to operate the products Grainger sells, such as the electricity required to run an industrial air conditioner or recharge the battery of a cordless drill over its lifetime. We plan to provide the results of our scope 3 analysis and our scope 3 emissions reduction target in the next one to two years. In addition, we plan to establish a carbon reduction program to help our customers achieve their emissions targets. The target coverage is company-wide and covers all global Grainger scope 1 and scope 2 (market based) emissions."

"Approved by the Science Based Targets initiative in October and announced publicly in November 2016. Approved goal language is as follows: Walmart will work to reduce CO2e emissions from upstream and downstream scope 3 sources by one billion metric tons between 2015 and 2030. This target is often referred to our Walmart's Gigaton Goal. Walmart launched Project Gigaton in April of 2017 to engage suppliers to commit to emissions reductions across pillars including energy, waste, packaging, deforestation and product use. Collectively, these actions can help us to achieve our science-based emissions target and to reduce or avoid emissions throughout our value chain by 1 billion metric tons by 2030. Since its launch three years ago, more than 3,100 suppliers have formally signed on, making Project Gigaton one of the largest private sector consortiums for climate action. Under Project Gigaton, suppliers report having avoided more than 186 MMT of CO2e in 2020, for a cumulative total of more than 416 MMT of CO2e avoided since 2017 (calculated in accordance with Walmart's Project Gigaton Methodology)."
"In 2020, we raised our aspiration to reduce emissions in our operations (scopes 1 & 2) by realigning our science-based target to a 1.5-degree Celsius trajectory, the highest ambition approved by the SBTi. Our goal is to achieve zero emissions across Walmart's global operations by 2040, reducing absolute scopes 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 35% by 2025 and by 65% by 2030 from our 2015 base year.Between our 2015 calendar year baseline and 2020, we reduced our absolute scopes 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 17.48% (equivalent to 3.48 million metric tons of CO2e), getting us close to achieving our original Science Based Target 2oC target of 18% by 2025 and on track to achieve our updated SBT1.5oC Target of 35% reduction in operations by 2025.

"Our greenhouse gas target was by 2020, to reduce net emissions by 50% compared to total gross emissions in 2012. In 2020, Disney reduced its net GHG emissions by 50% below 2012 gross emissions levels, meeting the 2020 target. Covered emissions in the base year are gross emissions (business as usual). Covered emissions in the reporting year were net emissions inclusive of all investments in emissions reductions, including third party carbon credits. Emissions are measured and reported based on the Company's fiscal year. After the expiration of our 2020 target this year, the Company set forward looking 2030 goals. This goal is further discussed in C4.2c."
"Based on the needs of global climate change and the environmental protection requirements of the government, the company formulated energy conservation and emission reduction targets according to the development needs. Through the introduction of energy-saving equipment, elimination of high energy consumption equipment, technical transformation, research and development of low-carbon and intelligent electronic control products, it is planned to reduce the total carbon emission by 5% in the target year."

"We achieved a 8.0% reduction on previous year (2019) emissions and our lowest annual emissions total since our baseline year of 2014/2015. While we have some work ahead of us several in-progress initiatives including transition to EVs, LED upgrades, methane capture from registered landfills, EV forklift transition, and packaging improvements etc, will continue to deliver emissions savings."
"Reduce energy consumption by at least 7% in terms of absolute consumption (GWh) from 2015 levels by 2025. Th target has been set on energy consumption reduction, not directly CO2 emissions reduction, but naturally there is an indirect, but clear effect on CO2 emissions reduction as well. The base year emissions have been calculated by the assumption that it was all electricity (which is not the case naturally) because much of the savings for the target are from saved electricity. DEFRA factor for the electricity has been used. Thus the base year emissions may vary from the total energy consumption of Wärtsilä quite substantially from what they actually were at the time. It should be noted that as we measure the results as per achieved, permanent energy savings, the way CDP system calculates the achievement percentage based on comparison between base year and the last year gives, in this case, too positive result compared to our internal calculation method."
"Abs1 is based on 2.1% year-over-year reduction of emissions between the base year and the target year from our fleet.  In 2021, as we set our SBTi-approved target, it will be updated to be 1.5 degrees celsius aligned."
Abs 4 goes beyond the aggressive 4.2% year-over-year emissions reduction between the base year and the target year by purchasing 100% renewable energy by 2025.
"Measuring our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is essential in our environmental management process. The company has dedicated resources to measure and manage our environmental footprint and has committed to reduce our emissions by 35% by 2025 from a 2016 baseline. Waters reports GHG market-based emissions for its 26 primary sites (2018). In total, these sites account for over 80% of total square footage and include those with the heaviest impact due to manufacturing and research operations."

"In 2019, over a decade early, we achieved our initial goal to reduce CO2 emissions from our electric generation by 40% below 2005 levels by 2030. Since 2018, we have retired more than 1,800 MW of nameplate coal capacity and by 2025 we will have retired two-thirds of total nameplate coal capacity. These retirements have lowered operating costs by approximately $100 million on an annual basis and eliminated more than 10 million tons of CO2 emissions per year from these sources."
"To ensure we remain on track to meet our new long-term goal, we set an interim target to reduce CO2 emissions from our electric generation by 55% below 2005 levels by 2025. (Note that we announced more aggressive carbon reduction goals in 2021, including a 60% reduction in carbon emissions by 2025.)"
"In 2020, in light of achieving our previous 2030 emission reduction goal in 2019, we revised our 2030 carbon reduction goal to a 70% reduction for our electric generation.  (Note that we announced more aggressive carbon reduction goals in 2021, including an 80% reduction by the end of 2030.)"
"Our 2050 goal is to be net carbon neutral.Scope 1 emissions for this calculation include all of WEC Energy Group's owned fossil fuel generation units. Biogenic mass is not included. For other reporting purposes, we include the CO2 associated with energy used to meet our native load in our calculation of our progress toward our CO2 reduction goals. By the end of 2020, we were able to reduce carbon dioxide emissions more than 50 percent below 2005 levels for our goal."
Due to the Corona-Crisis in 2020 we had much less CO2-emissions due to the fact that our technicans were not able to fly to our customers. This was the biggest impact on the reduction. Moreover we bought less aluminium due to lower order volume.
Weener set this year targets for 2030 . Target is set on scope 1 & 2 (market based )
Reduce absolute scope 1 and scope 2 GHG emissions  28 % by 2030 from a 20 19 base year.
"The target covers all GHG emissions of all assets and operations under scope 1 and 2 such as refrigerants, stationary combustion, mobile combustion, electricity and district heating."
"In Q1 2021, we made several public announcements about our partnerships with a variety of emerging technology companies.This includes electronic powertrain systems, hydrogen and biofuel alternatives, as well as autonomous options. We are alsocurrently testing our first electric-powered truck pilot program. We are committed to staying at the forefront of technology andto finding alternative ways to keep our trucks environmentally-friendly while using renewable energy. For GHG reduction goals(short and long term), see page 6 in CSR report"
In 2018 we established a new 2023 target to reduce absolute emissions by 10%.
"Western Digital promoted energy conservation across all sites in 2020. In addition, Western Digital used updated International Energy Association (IEA) emission factors, resulting in a significant decrease in Scope 2 emissions. Western Digital historically used GHG Protocol emission factors for international electricity, but due to a change in availability of updated data, Western Digital switched to conversion factors provided by the IEA. Furthermore, we have publicly committed to set science-based targets and have submitted proposed targets to the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi). We are actively working with SBTi to finalize our targets."
"As part of Westpac's 2020 Sustainability Strategy and Climate Change Position Statement and 2020 Action Plan, GHG emission reduction targets were set using Scope 1 and Scope 2 methodologies endorsed by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). Westpac's targets during the 2020 reporting year were: • 9% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2020; and • 34% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2030 (using 2016 baseline);         o An adjusted 2016 number that excludes emissions from Western Sydney data centre is used as a baseline for Westpac's 2020 and 2030 emissions reduction targets. The rebased 2016 Scope 1 and 2 figure is 147,620 tCO2-e. Western Sydney data centre was excluded from operational control from 2017 onwards. Westpac's refreshed targets for the 2020 period onwards were recently set in our Climate Change Position Statement and 2023 Action Plan. Westpac's updated Scope 1 and 2 target is: • to reduce Scope 1 and 2 emissions from a 2016 base year by:         o 85% by 2025; and         o 90% by 2030 These targets have been prepared using Scope 1 and scope 2 methodologies endorsed by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) and will be reported against from 2021 onwards."
"A new target covering Westpac New Zealand Limited (WNZL) Scope 1, Scope 2 and mandatory Scope 3 sources was set in 2019 as part of the carbonzero certification process. The target was set following the Toit? carbonzero program rules."
"We've reached our goal. At year-end 2020, our total (or absolute) greenhouse gas emissions decreased by 57 percent. We achieved these reductions primarily by consolidating operations to higher-efficiency mills, replacing fossil fuels with carbon-neutral biomass fuels, and reducing fertilizer use in our timberlands. We expect to maintain these gains and further decrease our emissions with the continued installation of new, more-efficient equipment and by investing in capital projects that decrease our need for fossil fuels and other greenhouse gas-emitting sources. This year, we are committing to set a new science-based greenhouse reduction goal that aligns with the need to maintain global temperature changes below 2 degrees.  In the past five years, we have made significant improvements, including capital investments at several mills to implement cleaner-burning units, energy optimization and upgrades to emission-control systems. These improvements have helped reduce our carbon monoxide emissions by 19 percent from five years ago."
"Our existing target had a deadline of 2020 and we have exceeded it, so need a new target for the next decade. We have modelled an absolute reduction in Scope 1 and 2 emissions with a base year of 2019/20 using SBTIs tool which would require a 42% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2030 to restrict warming to 1.5 degrees. We have set ourselves a target to reduce Scope 1 and 2 market based emissions by 80% by 2030. We will be applying for SBTI certification in the next 6 months."
"In 2010 we set ourselves a target to reduced Scope 1 and 2 location-based emissions by 10% by 2013.  We easily achieved this target, and over subsequent years, gradually extended it to ultimately aim for a 45% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 location-based emissions by 2020 from a FY2007 baseline. The target initially covered all of our UK operations, but was extended in 2017 to include our complete global Scope 1 and 2 footprint.  The level of reduction required over this time period to be in line with a 1.5D science based target would be 55% and for WB2D aligned, 32.5%. We have therefore achieved a reduction in carbon emissions in alignment with a science based trajectory for WB2D. Our scope 1 and 2 emissions include 100% of emissions including gas, electricity and refrigerant gases and for 100% of our operations."
"In order to achieve net zero emissions by 2040, we are aiming to reduce our Scope 1 and 2 emissions to zero. We believe by then, a credible zero-emission alternative to natural gas that we use for heating our distribution centres will have been developed. This builds upon our  80% reduction target for 2030, and incorporates 100% of our Scope 1 and 2 emissions from 100% of our portfolio."
"We reset out base year and targets annually at present due to our ever changing network (altering depot locations). We are continually addressing our network infrastructure and buildings and therefore review and currently set our targets annually.Our scope 1 emissions is where the majority of our emissions are presented due to our logistics operations. In 2020 there was a period whereby (due to COVID) we were able to reduce our operational pattern, reduce the number of operational days and size of fleet in line with decreased volumes in certain areas of the business.Our YoY scope 1 reduction was 6%"
"In 2020 reporting year, we successfully reduced our scope 2 CO2 emissions by 97% due to the Mainland Green Utilities contract which started in October 2019, and the NI Green Utilities contract negotiated in October 2020 securing further reduction."
"Our overall CO2e reduction target includes scope 1, 2 and 3 for our DSA division across Head Office and 5 depot locations.  We had not considered the longer term impact of COVID on scope 1 and 3, and therefore our overall emissions YoY reduced by over 13%"
"This target is new and was approved by the SBTi in December 2020. We have managed to reduce emissions significantly already during 2020 and are well on the way to achieving the 2030 target, mainly due to increasing purchases and production of renewable energy to replace fossil fuels."
"We announced our public Science-Based Target in April 2021 with a goal year of 2030: 50% absolute reduction in Scope 1 and 2 emissions and 14% absolute reduction in Scope 3 emissions from PG&S, downstream transportation, and use of sold product. We also set a goal to be 100% carbon neutral in Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2025. To achieve these goals, we're prioritizing emissions reduction across our value chain, from our factories to customer homes. Our emissions reduction plan includes the following priorities:Scopes 1 and 2: Our OperationsEFFICIENCY- We'll retrofit systems and upgrade to more energy-efficient equipment across our offices, stores and distribution centers, reducing the energy used to power our operations.RENEWABLES- We'll install solar where appropriate, purchase green power when possible and support new renewable energy projects through power purchase agreements (PPAs).We have achieved emissions reductions through energy efficiency projects throughout the company as well as a reduced footprint in retail locations. We are tracking our energy use through efficiency software and looking for opportunities to continue to decrease. We anticipate approaching the limit of energy efficiency in our scope 1 and 2 emissions within 5 years and are exploring renewable energy solutions for our operations through PPAs or direct generation to further reduce emissions."

PRODUCTION- We collected suppliers' environmental data to develop supplier strategies. Together, we'll set targets for emissions and renewable energy and track yearly progress.PRODUCT USE- We're working with representatives from each of our brands to offer the most energy-efficient options for appliances and lighting."
"In 2020, Williams set a near-term goal of reducing absolute greenhouse gas emissions 56% from 2005 levels by 2030, putting the company on a positive trajectory to be net zero emissions by 2050. By setting a near-term goal for 2030, we plan to leverage our natural gas-focused strategy and technology that is available today to reduce emissions, scale renewables and build a clean energy economy. We will do so while looking forward and anticipating innovations for the future like hydrogen and carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) that will ultimately contribute to our aspiration to be net zero by 2050. To reach our 2030 target, Williams is utilizing technology readily available today such as pursuing methane emissions reduction opportunities through leak detection and repair (LDAR), work practice improvements and evaluating equipment upgrades on a site-specific basis. This near-term phase also includes employing emissions reduction strategies through research organizations and trade groups. Williams is also exploring the use of solar power generation to support the power needs of specific natural gas transmission and processing operations sites. Our 2030 target shows our commitment to executing on opportunities in the here and now and holds our leadership accountable for near-term action and performance."

In our baseline year (2017) we set a 10-year goal year goal to reduce our Absolute Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 20% by 2027.   We are currently at 83% completion and have revised our Science Based Target to be completed in 2025.
Target is to reduce our base line emissions by 40% by 2035 as a part of the 2DC scenario.
Target is to reduce our absolute emissions by 60% by 2035 as a part of the 2DC scenario.
Target is to reduce our base line emissions by 100% by 2035 as a part of the B2DC scenario.
"By 2025, our entire vehicle fleet will be non-fossil fuel powered. We have made progress in converting some of the vehicles to electric vehicles in 2021, but as the reporting year is 2020 the target status is only achieved by 1,16%."
"We set an absolute target of reducing 2 GHG emissions 25% by the year 2025.  We use 2015 as the baseline year and the total Scope 2 emissions in 2020 are 232,747 metric tons CO2. We will work on getting an approval from the Science-based Targets Initiative in the following years. There have been ongoing efforts to reduce our GHG emissions across Windstream with a 18.6% reduction in Scope 2 GHG emissions from 2019 to 2020.  We are taking actions to decrease our emissions addressing both our direct emissions from onsite from purchased electricity. Although this goal was achieved in 2020, we anticipate the usage to increase as employees return to the workplace, post pandemic.  Before revising the target or setting the target as Achieved, we required additional monitoring of the emission levels into 2021 to confirm if we can sustain this level."
"We set a long-term absolute target of reducing our Scope2 GHG emissions 22% by the year 2035.  We use 2019 as the baseline year and the total Scope 2 emissions in 2020 are 232,749 metric tons CO2. Target 22% will allow us to meeting short term 25% by 2025 with plans to further improve to stretch Scope 2 to 30% from 2015 to 2035.    We will work on getting an approval from the Science-based Targets Initiative in the following years. Even though this target is set this year, there has been ongoing efforts to reduce our GHG emissions.  We reduced our Scope 2 emissions by 18.6% from 2019 to 2020.

"Windstream was an early provider and adopter of Unified Communications as a Service (UCaaS) solutions, which supports a geographically dispersed workforce with video and voice conferencing and chat functions. Leveraging our own OfficeSuite® UCaaS solution, we launched internal goals in 2017 and have reduced corporate business travel spend by 81.5% through 2020.  Although by this year's reduction we exceeded our 2025 target, a large portion of the reduction came from travel restrictions from the pandemic.   We are ambitious to reduce or adjust this metric any further in the following 5 years and anticipate targeting efforts to increase closer to 2019 levels which was just shy of our target. We expect the percent of reduction to increase over the years as it gets harder to decrease it below a certain level."
"We set an absolute target of reducing our Scope 1 GHG emissions 25% by the year 2025.  We use 2015 as the baseline year and the total Scope 1 emissions in 2020 are 62,956 metric tons CO2.  There have been ongoing efforts to reduce our GHG emissions with a 4.3% increase in Scope 1 GHG emissions from 2019 to 2020.  As we continue to be a growth-company we recognize our total mileage and gallon consumption will also grow.  We are taking actions to improve MPG and decrease our emissions with improve energy efficiency initiatives.  We are replacing this absolute target with an intensity target to better outline improvements to mobile combustion within Scope 1.  We are taking actions to decrease our emissions addressing direct emissions from onsite combustion."
"The target to reduce scope 1 and scope 2 by 48% by 2030 is SBTI approved. We have undertaken a re-calibration of our greenhouse gas emission targets in FY 2017-18 to account for two organizational accounting changes – the first due to divestment of our overseas customer data center business to Ensono and the second based on requirements of GHG protocol standard of accounting all leased/rented office spaces emissions under Scope 3. Considering 2017 as the base year, we have set medium term targets till 2022  and 2030 (detailed in response) and longer term targets till 2040 and 2050.The targets are for our India office operations - which comprise around 77.6% of global scope 1 and 2 emissions footprint in the base year.

We started calculating our CO2eq emissions in 2019 and calculated our emissions from 2017 onwards. In 2019 we also determined our target for 2020 but due to Corona we had a much larger reduction than expected (less travelling with company vehicles). We are planning to set a target for 2030 in line with the Paris Agreement. This target is specific for one of our sites in the Netherlands (Zeewolde site)

"A 45% reduction in carbon emissions was achieved by the end of 2018 from a 30% target. As you can see we have made great progress with driving our carbon reduction plan. In 2018 a new Science Based Target has been set by The Carbon Trust, which is in line with climate science but not endorsed by the SBTI.  We are currently putting a proposal together to expand the boundary of our target to include scope 3.   The new Science Based target was communicated alongside our Half Year results in September 2019.   Each business unit has their own pathway and target to feed into one absolute target. Carbon Trust commented specifically on the complexity of setting this target and ensuring we had correctly factored in the growth of our Wholesale/ Logistics arms, we followed a sector decarbonisation approach for the methodology of this target at a below 2 degree pathway.   This target sits alongside our Net zero target  in our own operations by 2040."
The second milestone of the Science Based Methodology applied and communicated through our Annual and Corporate Responsibility reports.
"(1) Due to COVID-19, total business travel by airplane and flight use decreased in 2020 by almost 90%. (2) Due to COVID-19, the total number of liters of fuel consumed by car travel decreased more than 50%, and consequently car use (liters/FTE) also decreased. Several of our businesses are implementing policies to decrease fuel usage and transition to more efficient cars, electric cars, or petrol/gasoline instead of diesel.(3) In total, there was a decrease of 72% in CO2 emissions from business travel.

"As part of Wood's strategy to align the organisations carbon reporting scope and boundaries, as part of the acquisition of Amec Foster Wheeler Ltd by John Wood Group plc in 2017, we reported our first holistic footprint for our business in 2019 covering all emissions under an operational control boundary. With a baseline dataset now being available, scope 1 and 2 emissions targets were modelled in line with the SBTi methodology. Based on our 2019 baseline, in 2020 Wood announced a science-based carbon reduction target aligned to a well below 2-degree scenario model:    •Wood will seek to reduce our global scope 1 & 2 emissions by 40% by 2030 on our journey towards ‘net-zero'Modelled initially on a 15-year timeline, Wood has set a target rounded to 40% over a 10-year timeline that brings us closer to the 1.5-degree scenario, which we hope to evolve towards over the short term on our journey to ‘net-zero'. As a first step in reducing our carbon emissions, we believe we have a defined roadmap to achieving our 2030 target and will seek to stretch beyond, as our target timeline progresses towards a future net zero ambition.We are currently seeking SBTi approval of our carbon reduction target and will seek to set a scope 3 target in 2021 in addition to our focus on scope 1&2 emissions. In 2020, we began discussions with our ELT/Board on setting scope 3 targets that place a focus on our supply chain emissions. A key deliverable within this will be a focus on business travel and engagement on climate issues with suppliers that align to Wood's sustainability ambitions and decarbonisation efforts.For the first time, our 2021 submission to CDP includes a full scope of our material scope 3 emissions for 2020."
"This target has been verified by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). We received SBTi approval outside of the CDP reporting period (in September 2020).  Using the Sectoral Decarbonisation Method, we investigated the 2°C and 1.5°C warming trajectories and modelled what it would take to achieve these. With a sector trajectory established from the SBT, we traced back to 2030 to what our emissions target would need to be. The analysis found that Woolworths' direct emissions need to be 63% less than 2015 Scope 1 and 2 emissions levels by 2030, which becomes our new target."
"This target is for a reduction in emission for our refrigeration leakage. In FY20, we exceeded our goal. Upgrading to more energy-efficient refrigerators combined with the above strategies, have reduced our carbon emissions and also our refrigeration leakage to 26% below 2015 levels.We have been rolling out leak detection systems; and a monitoring system which samples air through an infrared sensor from multiple zones around the store, and notifies our technicians if the refrigerant level exceeds a set threshold. We have now installed these systems in 255 stores. This eliminated high ozone-depleting potential refrigerants in these stores and has significantly reduced the global warming potential of the alternative refrigerants used. We have now rolled out a transcritical CO2  (natural) system to 28 stores across Australia and New Zealand and a waterloop system to 6 stores in Australia.In addition, three stores have a combined natural refrigeration and HVAC system, into an integrated transcritical CO2 platform. This combined system eliminates nearly all synthetic refrigerants from the store."
"This target covers our company-wide scope 1 emissions which include natural gas, fugitive emissions, transport and heat  and was approved by the science-based target initiative. We are currently on track to achieving this target."
This target aims to  'Continue to source 100% renewable electricity' and covers our company-wide scope 2 emissions which include market-based electricity.  This was approved by the Science-based target initiative.
"In 2020 Worley released its' Climate Change Position Statement, where we have publicly acknowledged the findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and have committed to reducing our Scope 1 and 2 emissions to net zero by 2030. We committed to establish our roadmap to net zero Scope 1 and 2 emissions and creating the shift required to embed emissions reduction thinking in the culture right across every level of our organization. This year, we have:•   Created our Scope 1 and 2 Net Zero Road Map. This shows how we will decarbonise our energy usage at a corporate level using energy efficiency, renewable energy, electrification, fuel switching, and finally, offsets. •   Completed a comprehensive stakeholder engagement program, where we interviewed all our business leaders with the aim of creating a framework for achieving net zero that will work for all parts of our business. We are currently creating this framework and plan to roll it out early FY2022.•   Appointed an energy manager and are implementing a new energy management system. This will allow for more robust data collection, and visibility of data for everyone in the business to design their location-specific net zero plans. •  Made some significant progress towards our target, including reduction of overall energy use, improvement of office energy efficiency, implementing renewable energy contracts, and switching to lower-carbon fuels in our vehicles. We intend to submit this target to be validated by the Science-based Targets Initiative.Note: Last year, we reported our FY2020 emissions baseline as 136,026tCO2e. After data gathering and validation, some calculation errors were found in our Scope 1 emissions. Our updated FY2020 baseline is 114,240tCO2e."
"In our updated Climate Change Position Statement in 2020, we committed to addressing our Scope 3 emissions and making a plan to reduce these. In April 2021, Worley signed on to the Business Ambition for 1.5C, a global movement of leading companies aligning their business with the most ambitious aim of the Paris Agreement. This means we commit to net zero Scope 3 emissions by no later than 2050, alongside science-based targets across all relevant scopes and in line with the criteria and recommendations of the Science Based Targets Initiative. Over the next 2 years, we will fully develop our Scope 3 target and get it validated and published by the Science-Based Targets initiative.  Our reported Scope 3 emissions constitute 100% of our known Scope 3 emissions sources and is not our baseline for all Scope 3 emissions. We have however, identified our material Scope 3 emissions through an internal study and have developed a plan to work through all of the remaining Scope 3 categories of the GHG by 2023, in line with SBTi.So far, we have only quantified our material emissions from Scope 3 category 1 (Purchased Goods and Services) and category 6 (Business Travel).  In the next few years, we will quantify all Scope 3 emissions relevant to Worley. This means that our Scope 3 emissions will increase over the coming years as we report more categories of Scope 3."
"Alongside our target of net zero Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 2030, we have set an interim target of 50% reduction of Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 2025. This is to ensure we take aggressive action on emissions reduction early in the decade.Due to our reduction in energy and emissions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, this year we reduced our emissions more than expected, and have almost achieved this target."
"WPP's scope 1 and 2 (market-based)  certified science-based carbon reduction target covers all material emissions, including those from our building and company cars. Organisational scope boundaries are defined by operational control, and all relevant entities are included.  The target was set in 2020 and reviewed by the Science-Based Targets Initiative in 2021. During 2020, at the peak of the Covid pandemic, 95% of WPP's employees were working from home. This means that our 2020 reduction was greater than in a normal operating year."
"WPP's scope 3 certified science-based carbon reduction target covers all scope 3 categories except emissions from sold products. Indirect emissions from use of sold products is optional to include in the SBT target boundary. WPP has attempted to estimate emissions from this source but has excluded the emissions from the target boundary until data quality can be improved. Organisational scope boundaries are defined by operational control, and all relevant entities are included.  The target was set in 2020 and reviewed by the Science-Based Targets Initiative in 2021."
Scope 1 emissions are currently based on total gas consumption and white vehicle fleet only. W have committed to a science-based target which will be in place within two years
Scope 2 covers purchased electricity only. We have committed to implementing a net-zero strategy and will be developing an SBT within 2 years
This scope 3 target covers grey fleet and business travel only.
"WSP plans to achieve a 25% reduction target by 2030 through the efficient use of office space, leasing energy-efficient real estate and implementing additional energy conservation measures, reducing business travel and shifting to low-carbon modes of travel, increasing the fuel efficiency of our vehicle fleet, and purchasing renewable energy."
"This 5% reduction in absolute, market-based GHG emissions across our global operations is an interim target from 2018 to 2021 to set WSP up for success in meeting our 2030 absolute target."

"Besides the regular equipment replacement, we will reduce carbon emissions by using energy -saving lamps, renewable energy, transforming production equipment, reducing office areas."
"Since the company is in an adjustment period, it can only achieve 60% of the target."
"Wyndham's Scope 1 and 2 emissions target is aligned with the 2-degree Celsius level of ambition, based on targeted absolute reductions of 2.5% annually set forth by the Science-Based Target initiative (SBTi). The scope of our 2025 emissions reduction target includes all owned, leased and managed properties. During 2020, the travel-related implications of COVID-19, including decreased occupancy at our owned and managed hotels, had a tremendous effect on our business and significantly impacted our environmental and economic performance. This resulted in nearly a 30% decrease in Scope 1 and 2 emissions."
"Xanterra continues to make efforts and strides at reducing emissions. A large number of construction projects have been undertaken and completed in recent years, including increasing renewable energy production on site.  In addition, numerous projects have removed older antiquated facilities and equipment with more energy efficient options."
"Replaced with NZ1In addition to our energy and GHG emissions reduction target we set an aspirational goal to source 100% of our total energy consumption, from renewable sources by 2050, therefore this is equivalent to a long-term target to reduce total GHG emissions from energy consumed by 100%. Total energy encompasses electricity and stationary and mobile fuel combustion by our fleet and facilitiesPlease note that in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, to make data and performance trends between years comparable the base year and base year emissions for this target were restated in 2018 as a result of the separation of the business.We reported progress against this same target in 2018, 2019 and 2020. This target has now been replaced with NZ1"
"In 2017 following the separation of the business into two independent, publicly-traded companies (on December 31, 2016) we set a new science based target which is both more ambitious and reflective of the current organization. In 2019 we achieved our corporate-wide science-based target of 25% reduction by 2025 from a 2016 baseline.We reported progress against this same target in 2018, 2019 and 2020. This target has now been replaced with Abs4."
"Having achieved the GHG target that we set in 2017 (Abs 3) five years early, in 2019 we set a new science-based target which is both more ambitious and reflective of the current organization. Our newly established target uses the same base year (2016) as we had previously used but increases the target to a 60% reduction of scope 1 and scope 2 market-based emissions by 2030 from a 2016 baseline. The methodology used to set our science-based target was the Absolute Emissions Contraction approach, a scientifically-informed method for companies to set GHG reduction targets necessary to  limit global temperatures to a 1.5°C rise above preindustrial levels based on the SR15 special report issued by the IPCC in 2018. The IPCC SR15 estimates an overall carbon budget of 420 GtCO2 for a 66% probability to limit warming to 1.5°C, and carbon budget of 580 GtCO2 for a 50% probability of limiting warming to the same temperature. We recently resubmitted our commitment to the Science Based Target initiative (SBTi) for the following reasons:•Xerox was listed under the ''Software and services” sector for our original commitment. Under our current structure, we should be listed under the ''Technology Hardware and Equipment” sector.•Xerox has separated from Conduent (previously known as Xerox Services).•The original commitment we submitted for year 2025 has already been achieved. We have a new, more aggressive commitment for 2030.SBTi has accepted our new commitment and has validated it."
"In addition to setting new science-based targets for scope 1 and scope 2 emissions, we set an additional emissions reduction target for its scope 3 emissions. Using the Absolute Emissions Contraction approach specified in the SBTi criteria, our goal is to reduce our scope 3 emissions by 35% by 2030 from a 2016 baseline in line with keeping global temperature well-below 2°C as defined by the SBTi GHG reduction scenarios.From Xerox's preliminary scope 3 screening, this target includes emissions from both upstream, operations, and downstream emission sources. Our target includes emissions from purchased goods and services (C1), Capital goods (C2), Fuel and Energy Related Activities (C3), upstream transportation and distribution (C4), waste generated in operations (C5), Business Travel (C6), employee commuting (C7), use of sold products (C11), and End of life treatment of sold products (C12) per the GHG Protocol corporate value chain emissions categories. Combined, these categories constitute Xerox's scope 3 emissions."

"Yap? Kredi aimed to reduce the sum of Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions of the Head Office buildings (Plaza D Block and Banking Base) and three service buildings (Dar?ca Archive Building, Bayramo?lu Training Facilities, Yeniköy Grove) by 15% in 2025 compared to 2015. In this target, total emissions were reduced by 59.49% in 2020, compared to the base year. In 2020, Yap? Kredi updated its 10-year target as stated above within the scope of its low carbon transition plan.  This update was performed due to three reasons. The first reason is that the target has been revised in line with the commitment to reach the goal of 1.5 degrees Celsius with science based targets. Yap? Kredi is the first company in Turkey, committed to Business Ambition for 1.5. The second reason is that the previous target only covers the Head Office buildings and three service buildings. The scope of the new target has been expanded to include all locations which are branches, ATMs located in branches and ATMs within the region of branches, and subsidiaries in addition to headquarters buildings and service buildings. The last reason is that the base year for Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions of all locations verified in accordance with the ISO 14064 standard has been changed from 2015 to 2019. Yap? Kredi aims to reduce its Scope 1 and Scope 2 absolute carbon emissions by 76% until 2030, compared to 2019. In the reporting year, a 17% reduction rate is achieved in total of Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions with implementing LED lighting systems, and offsetting  its Scope 2 emissions of 6,991.5 tCO2e with I-REC in 2020.  In order to achieve this target Yap? Kredi will be gradually transitioning to energy efficient lighting systems in all locations. It is planned to perform a transition on the heating systems of the branches which are currently using air conditioners for their heating purposes.

Total operational emissions include all  scope 1 and scope 2 sources, and the following scope 3 sources: business travel, employee commuting, waste, printed paper, fuel and energy related activities, and energy at strategic data centers. The target is considered ""underway"" as the majority of emissions reductions achieved are due to the COVID-19 global pandemic. We are committed to achieving lasting emissions reductions in line with our 2025 target."
"Zurich Abs 2 target sets the goal to achieve a 70% reduction in total absolute emissions by 2029, against a 2019 base year.  The target was approved internally in December 2020, and announced externally in Q1 2021.

"Zurich Abs 3 target sets the goal to achieve a 100% reduction in absolute grid electricity emissions, based on a 2019 baseline. In 2019, Zurich announced its commitment to purchase 100 percent renewable power at all offices by the end of 2022 and have formally joined the RE100 leadership initiative. Eliminating emissions from our grid electricity is a critical step in achieving our overarching science-based targets to reduce scope 1 + 2 by 55% by 2025, and by 80% by 2029 (against a 2019 base year) and our total aggregate targets to reduce absolute emissions by 50% by 2025, and 70% by 2029"
