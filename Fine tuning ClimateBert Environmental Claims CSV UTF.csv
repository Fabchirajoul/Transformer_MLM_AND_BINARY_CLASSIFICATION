Positive
"As a science-based company, 3M uses the World Resources Institute (WRI)/World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard to set GHG emission reduction targets. For this reason, we acted on the findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C to set our goals and actions.  We've remained committed to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) since 2005. Even though we have seen global emissions decrease temporarily as a result of the unprecedented global COVID-19 pandemic, climate change remains an existential threat. Its impacts are widespread, and its risks are not limited by continent, industry, or even species. Our Strategic Sustainability Framework directs our efforts to areas where we can make the biggest impact. Within the Science for Climate pillar of this framework, we will continue to focus on innovating to decarbonize industry, accelerating global climate solutions, and improving our environmental footprint. We'll continue to drive climate solutions in our operations, in our products, and in communities around the world. We will use the IPCC AR6 Climate Change 2021: The Physical Science Basis Report to inform our climate strategy. In 2015, 3M set a goal to ensure GHG emissions are at least 50% below our 2002 baseline by 2025. 3M's new commitment (announced in 2021) is to reduce Scope 1 and 2 market-based GHG emissions from our 2019 baseline by at least 50% by 2030, 80% by 2040, and be 100% carbon neutral in our operations by 2050. This is a stepped goal. The table above indicates the target for the first step."	Positive
"Progress against target has been achieved through a combination of internal initiatives and through the improved CO2 conversion factors as the network becomes more efficient. The reduction does not take into account the move to 100% electricity from renewable sources which was enacted in May 2020. We are in the process of developing science-based targets for our scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions that we aim to submit to the SBTi for approval in the automn of 2021."	Positive
"The target covers our whole operated container vessel fleet of about 700 ships. To date we have made significant improvements of 41.8% on relative emissions against our 2008 baseline, however as our fleet has grown since 2008, our absolute emissions have also grown. Therefore we witness, that growth while coupled with our efficiency savings cannot deliver on reducing absolute emissions.  To decarbonise the maritime sector, massive innovation needs to occur over the next 5-10 years.  It is because of this that we have announced our zero net carbon emissions target by 2050, so as to initiate decarbonisation evolution with the maritime sector."	Positive
"In 2015, we set ourselves the target of saving 100 percent of the CO2 emissions resulting from the consumption of conventional electricity by 2020. For this reason, in addition to our main locations in Wiesbaden and Mainz, we source environmentally friendly green electricity from hydropower at almost all german locations. The reference amount of 3,249 t CO2e is based on the scope of the Group-wide environmental indicators used in 2013 and includes all electricity consumptions in Germany. In order to ensure comparability of the values, the emission values last calculated for 2019 according to the identical location structure for 2015 were calculated. The survey therefore doesn't cover any international locations. These will be considered in a target which is currently under development.Due to active M&A  and increasing number of new small offices (and existing contracts with energy providers), we have decided to extend 2020 target to 2022. By the end of the reporting year, more than 98% green electricity had already been purchased at german sites, which is very close to the target of 100%. We envisage to extend green electricity purchasing to our international sites."	Positive
"In 2020, ABB divested its Power Grids business (PG) to Hitachi. In order to measure our progress properly, we have re-baselined our 2020 target by removing the contribution from our divested Power Grids business to the 2013 baseline (the baseline was reduced from 1,551 kilotons to 1,167 kilotons). We have also excluded the emissions of the 39 newly acquired sites (GEIS) added in 2019, for which no 2013 baseline data exists. This shows we have achieved a 58 percent reduction of our Scope 1+2 emissions from 2013.In 2018 we acquired the business ""GEIS"" and integrated these sites into our sustainability reporting in 2019. Since we don't have any 2013 baseline data for these 39 sites, we do not count it towards our progress towards our 2020 targets. ABB's total scope 1+2 emissions in 2020 amounted to 561 kilotons, without GEIS they were 487 kiloton.If we would have swallowed this acquisition and included the GEIS emissions while not being able to adjust the 2013 baseline upwards, we would still have over-achieved our 2020 target and reached 129% of the target. This scope 1 and 2 target was ambitious enough to be a science-based target, but we did not send it to the SBT Initiative for approval. Instead, this year we submitted ambitious targets for 2030 that were approved by the SBTi in May 2021."	Positive
"ABB launched this climate change target as part of its Sustainability Strategy 2030 in November 2020. The target has since been submitted and approved as a Science Based Target to the 1.5 degree C trajectory. ABB also committed to be carbon neutral in Scope 1+2 by 2020. After reducing as much as we can of our Scope 1+2 emissions through energy efficiency measures and other efforts in own operations (>80 percent), we will compensate for the remaining emissions through credible offsets when we approach 2030. This year, we have joined the Business Ambition for 1.5°C initiative and thus committed to achieve net-zero emissions across our value chain no later than 2050."	Positive
"ABB's science-based targets have been deemed to be in conformance with the SBTi Criteria and Recommendations (version 4.1).

"TARGET: Reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 CO2e emissions by 30% on an absolute basis compared with our 2018 baseline, which aligns with the objectives of the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) of well below the two-degree Celsius warming scenario.Our Sustainability Plan establishes new 2030 goals for protecting a healthy environment, which will further build on our progress in these priority areas.  Abbott has set absolute-reduction targets, that are science-aligned, for its 2030 goal. Procuring more renewable energy, emission credits and low-emission energy through US and European Virtual Power Purchase Agreements (VPPA) is a key strategy in reducing our CO2 emissions helping us meet our 2030 target.  To support our efforts to continually reduce CO2 emissions, beginning in 2016 we significantly expanded our use of renewable energy in our electricity contracts. To account for the lower emissions resulting from these contracts, we use the GHGP Scope 2 market-based methodology to report our progress on our 2030 carbon goal."	Positive
"In 2016 AbbVie decided to take a leadership approach to climate change by setting new aggressive targets to reduce emissions.  Our GHG reduction target is to reduce emissions 25% absolute, by 2025 with a 2015 baseline.  All GHG targets are combined scope 1 and 2 market based.  All quantities reported in this section are in Metric Tons of CO2e.  It should be noted that the CO2e emissions associated with the acquisition of Stemcentrx and Pharmacyclics as well as a new R&D center in Cambridge, MA are not included in the target calculation because they were not included in the 2015 baseline.  The CO2 emissions from these three businesses account for less than 1% of the total AbbVie CO2e emissions. In early 2020 AbbVie initiated the process of setting a science-based carbon target.  We submitted a letter of commitment to SBTi in June of 2021, and we anticipate setting a science-based target in 2022."	Positive

"This is a global target which is included in the Corporate Social Sustainability Strategic Plan 2019-2023. It is focused on the reduction of the absolute emissions from scope 1 and 2 of Abengoa's GHG Inventory in a 5% using the base of 2017. With this target, Abengoa expects to reduce an accumulated amount of 103532 tCO2eq by the year 2023. The target has been achieved, due to the fact that Abengoa has reduced around 286700 tCO2 in the first two years, more than 100% of the whole target. Two consideratios: 1) A3T plant emissions are excluded from the analysis, since it is out of the perimeter since Dec 2020 ans 2) emissions from bioethanol process (biomass emissions), are incorporated in Abengoa's scope 1 figure. The target Abs1 is going to be reconfigured prior the end of 2021, in order to be more ambitious in terms of emission reductions. It has not been carried out yet because the organization is under a heavy restructuring process and the perimeter can change significantly. This absolute target is directly connected to the intensity target ‘Int1'."	Positive
"This target has been created in 2020, since Abengoa's Abs2 reported in CDP last year was not enough ambitious. This is a target focused on supplies emissions, which is the company's most significant emission source in scope 3. It consists of the reduction of the emissions from this source in 35% in absolute terms. With this target, Abengoa intends to emit at the end of 2025 81146 tCO2 less than in 2019. In order to achieve it, the next actions are being carried out by: 1) Encouragement of the use of local suppliers: in order to reduce the emissions from the supplies transportation (e.g. Abengoa O&M subsidiaries, Abengoa Energy and Abengoa Water). 2) Give support for the carbon footprint reduction of the significant suppliers: through training actions and supporting meetings (e.g. Abengoa corporate). - Efficient use of resources: by awareness activities for the subsidiaries staff (Abengoa's corporate sites in Seville and Madrid). The target is progressing positively, since Abengoa has reduced around 64917 tCO2eq in the first year, the 80% of the whole target. Nevertheless, it is necessary to keep working hard on the target's achievement, as there may be business circumstances that make these emissions rise."	Positive

"Abt has set a goal to decarbonize by 2050, with an interim 25% reduction target by 2021 compared to our 2012 base year. The scope of this absolute emissions reduction target includes Scope 1, Scope 2 (location-based), and Scope 3 (upstream) from our U.S.-based operations. Abt Associates was able to achieve our interim absolute reduction target in 2017. Emissions from 2012-2018 have been externally verified to a reasonable level of assurance for Scope 1 and 2, and limited assurance for Scope 3 emissions. Emissions from 2019 and 2020 will be externally verified during the 2021 calendar year, as per our biennial verification cycle. To date, Abt has achieved a 71.7% emissions reduction. In 2020, we expanded our inventory to include emissions sources from telecommuting as this became material during COVID-19, accounting for 17% of our total 2020 emissions.Having met and exceeded the initial emission reduction target, in 2020 Abt developed our new target for 2025 (Abt's fiscal year 2026, Q3), aligned with our next five-year strategy. This updated target is aligned with the latest climate science to meet the goal of the Paris Agreement—to limit global warming well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and pursue efforts to limit warming to 1.5°C.

"As part of the stainless steel industry sector, Acerinox is aligned with the Paris Agreement to limit global warming by undertaking ambitious efforts to combat climate change and adapt to its effects.  The Paris Agreement works on a 5- year cycle of increasingly ambitious climate action carried out by countries.  Accordingly, we have ratified our commitment to achieving carbon neutrality as a long term goal (2050) with intermediate steps such as 20% CO2 reduction by 2030.  Digital transformation, electrification o boost transport and industrial processes in an effort to reduce emissions, adopt alternative energies and increase efficiency and hydrogen support are the main channels through which Acerinox will descarbonise its value chain.

Additionally, compressed air conservation is being applied via reduced pressure operation and leakage detection among other compressor efficiency measures, which reduced the compressors' energy consumption significantly. Finally, there is a plan to gradually replace hydraulic machinery with modern, energy efficient all-electric machinery when they reach the end of their service life. Hydraulic machinery is expected to be phased out completely by 2038.Because all of ACIP's offices are at the same location as the factory, the target coverage is considered company wide."	Positive

"Coverage Explanation:The sites included in this reporting year covered 97% of our employees (excluding retail employees). Sites are located all over the world and are chosen to be part of reporting based on a criteria of size (both in square meters and employees) and type (for example distribution centers). In 2020 our reporting boundary (Green Company Scope) doesn't include Own Retail for Scope 1 and 2.The base year covered 75% of the employees and increased every year. For example, in 2018 we covered 90%. In the baseline year, 15 of our key locations reported data into our data system. This scope has been expanded each year to include as well smaller locations. In 2020, 104 locations are in the reporting scope, so all offices, production sites and distribution centers that adidas operates are included the system. For reporting purposes, multiple buildings are combined into one site. Some adidas employees work in shared offices or in space provided by our suppliers. Adidas has no control over this data and these spaces are therefore not part of the data collection. I.e. sites smaller than 1000sqm and 50sqm do not have a relevant impact on the total consumption of adidas.Green Company Report:  https://www.adidas-group.com/media/filer_public/f8/10/f8105750-28cb-4a13-9e2c-7031785b2c92/adidas_gcr_2020_en.pdfScience Based Target Explanation:In 2015, adidas set an annual absolute net emission reduction target of 3 % for combined Scope 1 and 2, which aggregates to 15% until 2020. In 2020, adidas achieved a reduction of 55% in combined Scope 1 and 2 emissions. The big increase in savings was the implementation  of RECs in our key locations in North America and Europe."

"The company has assumed the goal of neutralizing its emissions by 2025 and making them positive by 2030. For the purposes of completing the CDP, and due to the format restrictions of question 4.1a, AES Brasil identified a reduction target of 100% in relation to the base year. However, it is worth clarifying that the target assumed by the company covers the neutralization of 100% of emissions by 2025, which may combine emission reduction strategies and compensation through the purchase of carbon credits.In 2020, the company has already neutralized its emissions for the period (845.97 tCO2e) through the purchase of carbon credits from a forest preservation project with the Friends of the Climate initiative. Therefore, for calculation purposes in this CDP questionnaire form, the value of 0 tCO2e in the year was inserted (achievement of 100% of the goal).All emissions figures presented here in the CDP consider the consolidated metric tons of CO2e of AES Brasil Energia S.A. and all subsidiaries.

"Aviation is responsible for an estimated 2% to 3% of man?made greenhouse gas emissions. Despite the Covid?19 public healthcrisis and if no action is taken, the forecasts for global air traffic growth in the coming years could, however, see this proportionincrease.The aviation industry is the first economic sector to have set ambitious long?term reduction targets and to have adopted a worldwide carbon offsetting system within the framework of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) to guarantee carbon?neutral growth for global air transportation as of 2020.In 2009, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) thus set ambitious worldwide targets for reducing the CO2 emissionsfrom air transportation:— 1.5% average annual fuel efficiency improvement until 2020;— carbon neutral growth from 2020 onwards;— a 50% reduction in net aviation CO2 emissions in 2050relative to the 2005 level.While international aviation is not included in the Paris Climate Agreement, the industry's efforts respond to the latter's targetof limiting the global temperature increase to below 2°C. In its Energy Technology Perspectives 2017, the International EnergyAgency considers that the airline industry's target for 2050 is more ambitious than what would be required for a 2°C scenario(2°C Scenario – 2DS) and close to a scenario of beyond 2°C (Beyond 2°C Scenario – B2DS) without taking into account theeffects of carbon offsetting.Air France – KLM endorses the IATA's targets and has set itself proprietary intermediate targets aimed at reducing its CO2 emissions by 2020, 2030 and 2050.See Universal registration Document p189 4.3.1 Carbon emissions Context and strategy (https://www.airfranceklm.com/en/finance/publications)"	Positive

It has not been certified by SBTi as the perimeter does not include sufficient scope 3 emissions yet.The 2020 status shows a significant decrease of environmental footprint compared to 2019 due to the unexpected and unprecedented COVID-19 crisis, materially affecting the Company's commercial aircraft operations. CO2 emissions have decreased by around 20% in 2020, in part due to the decrease of industrial activities mainly in the Company's commercial aircraft operations. Nevertheless, significant efforts have been made on all environmental aspects with regards to metering and digitising data acquisition and analysis in order to comply with long-term objectives."

"This target concerns the reduction of CO2 emissions from our fleet of specialised transport aircraft (Beluga) used for internal logistic transporting aircraft structures between production sites and assembly lines. The objective is to reduce Beluga emissions by 30% by 2030 (2019 baseline) through the gradual introduction of Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) in the fuel used by the aircraft fleet. This comes as a contribution to our global High5+ plan to reduce industrial emissions (scope 1, 2 and a subset of scope 3) by 40% by 2030 (2015 baseline), which was set up using science based target methodology and guidelines but has not been submitted for validation since industrial emissions do not cover the required two-third of value chain emissions."

"This year we announced our commitment to achieve carbon neutrality for our corporate operations by 2021, which includes our Scope 1 emissions and Scope 2 corporate emissions.  We will offset our Scope 1 emissions with carbon credits. Previously, we have set up a goal to purchase 1% renewable electricity in our Sydney West and Melbourne data centres, and 100% renewable electricity in our Sydney Head Office. This covers 100% of our corporate electricity consumption and related Scope 2 emissions. We have achieved our goal annually since 2018. The customer electricity consumption and related Scope 2 emissions are not covered by this target.  We aim for our carbon action to expand beyond our corporate emissions and are working to set Paris-aligned climate targets for our business. We are in the process of working with our customers and partners to achieve this."	Positive
"Scope 1 covers direct emissions from fuel consumotion of stationary plants (gas), from mobile source (vehicle fleet, petrol, diesel) and process emissions. Scope 2 covers indirect emissions from the purchase of electricity and district heating. The target for Scope 1 and 2 has already been achieved through a variety of energy efficiency measures (e.g. switching to LED) as well as through the procurement of electricity from renewable energy sources. We will set new CO2 reduction targets this year (both for Scope 1 + 2 and Scope 3, especially with regard to the Scope 3 category of purchased goods and services, which accounts for a high proportion of emissions)."

"The target is to reduce absolute GHG market-based emissions below 2015 levels by 2020. This work will be accomplished by procuring renewable energy and building colocation partnerships through the Renewable Energy Buyers Alliance (REBA) Future of Internet Power (FoIP). Akamai will cover 50% of our global network energy consumption of our paid leased facilities. We have achieved just over 100% of our goal renewable goal due to our colocation partnerships that supply 100% renewable energy and direct-vPPA renewable projects invested in to bring net-new renewables to market. We saw a 109,540 MT reduction in our CO2e footprint in 2020.When we look at our baseline targets from 2015 against per-gigabit capacity on the platform, Akamai was able to divert ~440% of its carbon emissions through the end of 2020. The data is based on platform efficiency, due to lower hardware power consumption while still having continued capacity growth within a similar data center power footprint close to baseline. Under this view, since 2015, we have mitigated over ~950,000 MT of potential carbon emissions when compared to today per gigabit of capacity served by our networkThe % of emissions in Scope is less than 100% because the target is focused on GHG emissions associated with Akamai's global network and office operations. It makes up ~92% of our total impact, which includes:1) Akamai operated and owned data centers and colocation facilities (including server hardware)2) Leased, colocation data centers (including server hardware)3) Leased office space (Includes lab space)This does not include items in Scope 3:1) Data Centers where Akamai has free space and power to support operations of network partnersABS1 was initially reported on the 2017 CDP report.Akamai is investing in virtual power purchase agreements (vPPAs) in target regions where we have significant network operations. We also incepted a program in conjunction with the REBA's FoIP to educate data center operators on procuring affordable renewable energy to power their facilities through a newly pioneered program Called LESSEN which will help with additional GHG reductions beyond 2020."

"Akastor's own emissions are limited to the office- and travel related emissions of its 15 employees. Compared to the climate-related issues in Akastor's investment activities, its own emissions are insignificant. Scope 3 emissions are expected to increase due to increased overseas activities, which will necessitate more travel. Scope 2 emissions, which are from Akastor's office activities, are expected to remain stable over the next five years. Akastor will reduce the net CO2 emissions from our own activities to zero by 2030."	Positive
"Akbank plans to beceome a carbon-netural bank by eliminating its gross CO2 emissions of its company-wide facilities (covering Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions) until 2025 by implementing SBTi with well-below 2°C aligned target ambition. In order to calculate yearly emission reduction plan, as Akbank, we conducted scenario analysis for the intervals of 2020-2025 in terms of the scenarios of keeping the global temperature way below 2 degrees Celsius (WB2C) When we chose 2020 as the base year, we have to decrease our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 12.5% since 2025. Akbank will become a carbon neutral bank by taking the following steps:•Decreasing the operational emissions through current and future energy efficiency projects•Switching to 100% Renewable Electricity By June 2021, we are planning to purchase  60% of electricity from REWe aim to reduce our energy consumption by 5% with the solar energy panels to be installed•Carbon offsetting While we implement the 2 steps above, we will be carbon neutral by offsetting the remaining carbon emissions in 2025."

"This target covers all of our scope 1 & 2 emissions. In 2020, our progress to decarbonise our own operations continued, however with the caveat of Covid-19. Our energy efficiency programs are at the heart of our success. Our electricity usage intensity per sq. ft decreased by 27% relative to 2016, and 38% relative to our historical baseline (2013).  Having more and more stores proactively choose renewable energy contracts with their energy providers is another measure that is having a strong impact in reducing our scope 2 emissions. All but one distribution center (DC) are no longer under operational control, as of 2019. This has resulted in a drop in electricity and natural gas consumption as well as fugitive emissions; the intensity figures of 27% and 38% are independent of DC energy usage being reallocated as a scope 3 category."

"We have an absolute target of 30% reduction in scope 3 emissions because we are members of the United Nations Fashion Industry Charter for Climate Action (UN FICCA).  This target covers all relevant scope 3 categories: purchased G&S, F&E activities, upstream transportation, waste, business travel, upstream leased assets (3PL DCs), downstream transportation, end-of-life treatment of sold products and franchises. Use of sold products is considered immaterial as our footwear, handbags and accessories are seldom cleaned during their use phase. The majority of our improvement has been due to more efficient product transportation, reduced business travel, improved packaging materials and lower emissions product materials.  Note that FY2020 product materials & manufacturing emissions has not yet been calculated therefore we are unable to fill out the appropriate field."	Positive
"Alfa Laval's carbon emissions target aimed at reducing carbon emissions by 15% between 2015 and 2020.The target reported in our Sustainability Report 2020 (see page 28 of Alfa Laval's Sustainability Report 2020) refers primarily to energy consumption within and outside the organization (Scope 1 and Scope 2 market-based emissions):emissions in 2015 = 76,777 tonnes CO2eemissions in 2020 = 35,465 tonnes CO2e-> 54% decreaseIn the answer to this particular question we further apply a broader approach to our carbon emissions and disclose emissions in Scope 1+Scope 2 (market-based)+Scope 3 (see page 47 of Alfa Laval's Sustainability Report 2020). Scope 1 includes energy consumption within the organization and company cars. Scope 2 includes direct emissions (market-based method) and Scope 3 includes goods transportation, business travel (air travel and rental cars). The base year and the year the target was set is 2015 and the strategy period was 2016–2020:emissions in 2015 (Scope 1+2 market-based + 3 downstream) = 155,093 tonnes CO2eemissions in 2019 (Scope 1+2 market-based + 3 downstream) = 83,399 tonnes CO2e-> 54% decrease since the base year.The base year emissions figure was revised due to organizational changes and a transition to a new reporting and data management system.To ensure Alfa Laval reached its carbon emission target, we continuously work to increase the proportion of renewable electricity used. In 2020, 78% of Alfa Laval's electricity was sourced from renewable sources, compared with 27% in 2015 (see page 46 of Sustainability report 2020). We further continue to increase the share of power purchase agreements in our global electricity supply. We focused on sites where electricity was generated from coal or other fossil fuels. Recently, six of our large operation sites in China and India began to source 100% of their electricity from renewable sources. However, our carbon emissions from goods transport remain high due to greater transport need and more air freight compared to sea freight. In 2020, emissions from goods transportation amounted to 42,864 tonnes of CO2e, a 15% decrease relatively to 2019 and a 7% drecrease compared to the baseline 2015 (see page 28 of Alfa Laval's Sustainability Report 2020). Goods transportation emissions per tonne kilometre were 93 gram/tonkm compared with 92 gram/tonkm, which was the baseline 2015."	Positive

During the base year of 2018 we produced 0.72 metric tons of CO2  from the use of Furnace Oil. During reporting year we did not use furnace oil as source of fuel for Boilers at all and  CO2 emissions are zero for the reporting year starting from 1 Jan 2020 to 31 December 2020.	Positive
"At the end of 2020, the CO2 emissions had fallen by 22% to (6,612 tonnes) compared to baseline (9,658 tonnes). The target covers all production sites, which account for apporx. 76% of our global workforce. In addition to these sites, ALK has smaller sales offices in several countries worldwide. These are usually small offices in rented buildings, and ALK has little opportunity to make significant changes at these locations, which is why they are determined to be out of scope for environmental target-setting and reporting. ALK does however conduct awareness-raising initiatives at these locations and to the extent possible seek to make changes that positively impact the environment. One example is our offices in the Netherlands that have switched to majority electric or hybrid cars, a solution that works at this particular location because of the short distances travelled by sales representatives."

"Alliant Energy strives to accelerate emissions reductions as part of its Clean Energy Vision.  In 2020, our fossil-fuel generation carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions decreased 42% from 2005 levels.  We also recently achieved one of our goals – to have 30% of our energy mix come from carbon-free renewable resources – 10 years ahead of schedule. In 2020, our Clean Energy Vision goals were updated given the significant progress achieved adding new company-owned wind generation (1,150 MW) and plans to implement solar generation (1,500 MW). The updated goals are:- Achieving a 50% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2030 (up from our prior goal of 40%)- Eliminating all coal from our generation fleet by 2040 (10 years faster than our previous target) - Adding an aspirational goal that achieves net-zero CO2 emissions from the electricity we generate by 2050- Adding a new goal that 100% of our active company-owned light-duty fleet vehicles will be electric by 2030Furthermore, Alliant Energy added another new goal in 2021, an initiative to donate and help plant more than one million trees – one tree for each of our customers – over the next decade.Alliant Energy's plans for a clean energy future are expected to be consistent with the carbon reductions and climate goals pledged originally by the U.S. under the voluntary United Nations Paris Accord.  Our company is participating in an Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) technical study assessing the relationship between company-specific carbon transition scenarios and scientific research on the projected emission reductions derived from global climate warming models.

"Every year, we have a goal of being carbon neutral. As of December 31, 2020, we reached carbon neutrality for 100% of our FY2020 operational emissions, which represent Scope 1 + Scope 2 (market-based) + Scope 3 (business travel, candidate travel, and employee commuting).Abs1 covers Scope 1 + Scope 2 (market-based) + Scope 3 (business travel, candidate travel, and employee commuting). We committed to being carbon neutral in 2007 and we have achieved this goal each year since then. We maintain our commitment to carbon neutrality of our operational footprint first through energy efficiency, second, by signing long-term contracts for renewable energy directly from our utility providers and from renewable energy facilities in the same grid regions as our data centers, and lastly, by investing in high-quality carbon offset projects. In 2020, we achieved 14 consecutive years of carbon neutrality. In 2020, we also neutralized our legacy carbon footprint since our founding, making Google the first major company to be carbon neutral for its entire operating history.We understand that CDP does not acknowledge carbon offsets as a way to reduce emissions, however, we do recognize offsets as a viable and important approach for mitigating our carbon emissions impact, as well as a critical component of our three-tiered carbon neutrality strategy.

"Abs2 includes Low1, as well as Scope 1 emissions. In 2012, we set a long-term goal to purchase enough renewable energy to match all the electricity we consume globally on an annual basis. For the past four years (2017-2020) we achieved it: Google's total purchase of energy from sources like wind and solar exceeded the amount of electricity used by our operations around the world, including offices, data centers, and networking infrastructure. While we're still drawing power from the grid, some of which is from fossil fuel resources, we're purchasing enough wind and solar energy to match every megawatt-hour (MWh) of electricity our data center and office operations consume annually. In 2020, our annual GHG reductions from our renewable energy projects were 4.9 million metric tons. This puts us 341% of the way towards this goal from an emissions reduction perspective. Google is the largest annual corporate purchaser of renewable energy in the world. From 2010 to 2020, we've signed more than 55 agreements totaling nearly 6 gigawatts of renewable energy. Reaching our 100% renewable purchasing goal means that Google buys on an annual basis the same amount of MWh of renewable energy—both the physical energy and its corresponding renewable energy certificates (RECs)—as the amount of MWh of electricity that we consume for our operations around the world. Where possible, we buy this energy directly from our utility providers and from renewable energy facilities in the same grid regions as our data centers.Since we're using Abs2 as our interim target for Abs3 and it would be difficult to predict our emissions in 2040, we used most of the same data here for Abs3 as we did for Abs2. We know we'll increase our annual GHG emissions reduction by at least 1.8 million tCO2e of emissions (our Abs2 target) sometime before 2040. The actual reduction in tCO2 will likely be greater as we believe our Scope 2 emissions will grow between our base year and 2040. Matching 100% renewable energy is just the beginning. We'll continue to buy renewable energy to match our growing electricity load. And in those regions where we can't yet buy renewables, we'll keep working on ways to help open the market. By 2030, we aim to operate on carbon-free energy 24/7. For more details about our 24/7 Carbon-free Energy goal, see https://sustainability.google/commitments/"	Positive

"This target covers all Amadeus' Scope 1 and 2 emissions worldwide. Amadeus has established objectives to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions and become a carbon-neutral growth company.  In 2016 we set a company-wide carbon-neutral growth policy, with 2015 as the baseline year. To make this target more ambitious, our baseline year emissions are net of carbon offsets. Our gross emissions in 2015 without discounting carbon offset were 34,171 tons of CO2  - of which 2,364 tons CO2e were offset, and as already mentioned these are excluded from the base year resulting in 31,807 for our target.We have adapted this objective to make it compatible with our ambition to reduce our emissions to zero by 2050, in line with the objectives of the Paris Agreement. Accordingly, the objective for 2020 is calculated based on the linear rate of emissions reductions needed from the baseline year to achieve full carbon neutrality by 2050.Since we set the target in 2016, we have implemented measures to reduce emissions. We worked with the UNFCCC (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change) to offset the emissions that we could not avoid, to reach our target. We invested in Clean Development Mechanism projects in India and offset more than 32,000 tons of CO2, with Certified Emissions Reductions from these projects.In 2019 we took a significant step forward by moving the Data Center to 100% renewable energy. This was achieved through the purchase of Guarantees of Origin of renewable energy. In 2020, with the use of Guarantees of Origin we have reduced our CO2 emissions company-wide (Scope 2) by 70.5% and delivered net emissions reductions of 32,775 tons of Scope 2 emissions compared to the reported in 2018.  With this more ambitious strategy, direct reductions were achieved and we did not need to use offsetting credits."	Positive
"In 2017 we signed the UN Climate Neutral Pledge. In line with the Paris Agreement on climate change, and by signing the pledge, we commit to become climate neutral by 2050. As 2050 is a very long-term goal, we intend to achieve our target to become carbon neutral by 2030. Based on our objective of zero emissions by 2050,  and taking a linear approach, we have calculated that this long-term target needs a yearly reduction of 2.86% since the baseline year. Accordingly, in 2020 the targeted reduction from baseline year would be 14%, a percentage that we have significantly exceeded as hereby reported (52.63% of target achieved). Calculation of the yearly reduction:-Years to achieve the zero emissions 2050 – 2015 = 35-Percentage of emissions to reduce each year: 100/35 = 2.86%-Objective for 2020: (2020-2015) x 2.86% = 14%This target covers all Amadeus' Scope 1 and 2 emissions worldwide. In 2020 we have achieved a reduction of 52.63% CO2e in our combined Scope 1 & 2 from our baseline year thanks to energy efficiency measures and the implementation of 100% renewable energy at the Data Center through Guarantees of Origin (GOs) of renewable energy. Although this reduction is consistent with the continuous decrease of CO2e that we have been reporting last years, we are aware that it has been particularly remarkable in 2020 due to the partial or total closing of our offices as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic.More detailed information on our performance regarding emissions can be found at:http://www.amadeus.com/documents/corporate/corporate_responsibility/amadeus-operations-environmental-performance.pdf"	Positive
"In 2018, Ambipar carried out a technical, environmental, and economic feasibility study for capturing and using biogas generated at the Aracruz CTR (the organization's main source of emissions) for energy production.Although the study demonstrated the ''unfeasibility of the project to use biogas” for energy production, the organization decided to implement capturing and flaring without energy production. Considering the production of 25m³ CH4/t of waste; that 85% of the  biogas issued will be recovered and flaring efficiency standards are around 90%, by 2030 we expect it will be possible to reduce burning by about 76.5% of the methane generated at the Aracruz CTR. This flaring percentage will be revised due to another feasibility study that will be prepared for this flaring process."	Positive

"AEO joined the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change's (UNFCCC) Fashion Industry Charter for Climate Action in 2019, adopting their overarching goal of achieving 30% reduction across all scopes by 2030."	Positive
"AEO joined RE100 in 2019, committing to achieving carbon neutrality across all of our owned and operated facilities (offices, stores, distribution centers) and employee business travel by 2030. This includes sourcing 100% renewable electricity."	Positive
"In mid-2017, in response to ongoing engagement on these issues with various stakeholders, AEP began to develop new intermediate and long-term carbon reduction goals. In 2020, we undertook a year-long Climate Impact Analysis effort to analyse the risks to our company from climate change, as well as potential business opportunities it might create. The report reflects our commitment to working toward 100% clean energy while also addressing the physical risks to infrastructure and people from a changing climate and the socio-economic effects that coal-fueled power plant closures have on the workforce as well as local and regional economies. We reviewed our carbon emission reduction goals as part of this process and have accelerated them to achieve an 80% reduction by 2030 and net-zero emissions by 2050 (from a 2000 baseline).We have long believed that our clean energy transformation strategy is aligned with the Paris Agreement. The climate scenario analysis we undertook demonstrates that our strategy is on course with achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement. And, it reminds us that the transition must build resilience into the system to handle extremes. It also shows us that there are still many uncertainties about technology, resources and the pace and cost of the transition. Our path forward will evolve, and, as it does, we will continue to engage our stakeholders."	Positive
"We are committed to achieve carbon neutrality for our operations Scope 1 and 2 (market-based) and  Scope 3 (business travel and employee business travel, including third-party air, rail and rental cars) by 2025. Operations include all our managed facilities, field sites and data centers. To help us achieve this GHG goal, we are implementing energy efficiency projects and procuring renewable energy at our facilities. We also have an operational goal to reduce energy use by 35% across our global managed portfolio from 2011 to 2025. For unavoidable emissions we invest in certified carbon offsets to achieve the carbon neutrality commitment."	Positive
"We are committing to maintaining carbon neutrality for our operations Scope 1 and 2 (market-based) and Scope 3 (business travel) (employee business travel, including third-party air, rail and rental cars) through at least 2035.

"In 2020, AmFam committed to achieving carbon neutrality by 2030 for our scope 1, scope 2 (market-based) and scope 3 upstream emissions. The upstream scope 3 emissions covered by this commitment include Purchased goods and services (from paper and cloud services only), Fuel and energy-related activities (not included in Scopes 1 or 2), Waste generated in operations, and Business Travel. To reach this goal, we are continuing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through implementing energy efficiency projects, increasing on-site renewable energy production and renewable energy purchases, transitioning to a high-efficiency vehicle fleet, and diverting waste from the landfill. As part of this carbon neutrality commitment, we plan to reduce our emissions 50% by 2025. For unavoidable emissions, we are committed to purchasing carbon offsets where we operate. We consider this target science-based because it aligns with an over 4.2% annual linear reduction rate over the target period, which is consistent with the 1.5°C aligned target ambition."	Positive

"AIG is a supporter of the UK Carbon Reduction Commitment (CRC) in the UK, and has committed to reducing the Carbon emissions associated with its UK business operations by 20% by the year 2020.  AIG's UK operations have exceeded the target commitment, reducing overall Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 69%, more than three times the target. The CRC expired in 2020, so there won't be future reporting."	Positive
"Nearly all of our carbon footprint is attributed to generating power as a service for tenants in markets with non-existent or unreliable electric grids. Though we cannot control the energy demand from tenant equipment, we are working to reduce the associated scope 1 emissions by investing in efficiency improvements and renewable energy. Since 2017, we have invested approximately $160 million toward these efforts. We targeted these markets because they account for 99% of the total diesel purchased by American Tower, and a representative portion of the Company's scope 1 footprint. In 2020, we achieved an additional 8% reduction from 2019, reaching 53% of the 10-year goal. We intend to build on this momentum and are in the process of developing implementation plans to achieve greater GHG emission reductions that are aligned with the Paris Agreement and the Science-Based Targets initiative.Note that the baseline emissions figure has been revised to account for acquisitions in accordance with The Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (Revised Edition)."	Positive
"American Water has committed to reducing our GHG emissions by 40% from our base year of 2007 by 2025. Our GHG emissions as of 2020 were 545,111 MT CO2e meaning we achieved approximately a 36% reduction from our base year, and are 90% of the way toward our goal."	Positive
"In 2018, we set a goal to have 2-3% of our US electricity from on-site renewable sources by FY20. Since 2018, we have completed two on-site solar arrays at our Phoenix and Sacramento locations. Due to unexpected delays as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we are reporting this target as revised. While both were completed in FY20, due to them coming online much later than planned, they generated approximately 1% of our U.S. electricity for the year. With both projects now online, we anticipate we will achieve this goal by the end of 2021 for on-site generation. Globally, more than 3% of our purchased electricity comes from renewable sources (on-site and purchases). Additionally, we saw a decrease in Scope 2 emissions overall as a result of efficiency projects implemented over the last several years, and as mentioned previously, a reduction due to the impact of COVID-19 on our operations."	Positive
"In the beginning of 2021, we announced the intent to acquire Alliance Healthcare, formerly a part of the Walgreens Boots Alliance family. The acquisition was finalized in June 2021.  With the announcement of a new acquisition that would significantly change our carbon footprint, we determined it would not make sense to submit a formal target to the Science Based Target initiative (SBTi) until the acquisition was finalized and we could include our Alliance Healthcare footprint in our target. We made the decision to set a short-term target for the AmerisourceBergen portfolio inclusive of Scope 1 and 2 emissions for the interim while we determine our new global footprint including Alliance Healthcare. This interim target, a 5% reduction by the end of FY2022, was developed in line with the SBTi's criteria and guidelines. We have formally committed to set a science-based target through SBTi and plan to submit within the next year. Note on Target Status: While we have achieved a significant reduction year on year beyond the goal target, this is in part due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in the temporary closure of many of our offices and facilities as well as a reduction in fuel use. While we have continued to advance our efficiency improvements at our distribution centers, we do anticipate our emissions to rise slightly as we ''return to normal” and our offices reopen."	Positive
"In 2020 we initiated our third multi-year environmental sustainability plan with the aspiration to achieve carbon neutrality by year end 2027.   Our carbon neutrality encompasses 100 percent of Amgen's Scope 1 and Scope 2 (market-based) emissions.  This includes emissions from our sales fleet; fugitive emissions from purchased and generated carbon dioxide and refrigerant losses; executive travel; and from energy usage in our operations.  For energy use in our operations, we track invoiced energy usage from 88 percent of our worldwide facility space, based on total square feet and calculate emissions from fuel and supplied electricity emission factors.  Energy and carbon data for the remaining 12 percent of facility space is estimated based on building energy intensity factors and country specific emission factors. This includes leased buildings where we have operational control over building infrastructure, including utilities."	Positive
"We track a variety of climate-related metrics across our operations and value chain. We believe our new goals demonstrate to our stakeholders that we are committed to reducing our environmental impact, while also reducing our exposure to a carbon price. Our commitment to carbon neutrality by 2030 involves a combination of approaches, including reducing our emissions, migrating energy procurement in favor of renewable and clean energy, and purchasing carbon offsets. By doing so, we are finding ways to reduce the potential effect of future carbon prices on our business. We will continue to measure and disclose our performance against our goals. There is also a plan to generate 100% renewable energy by 2030."	Positive
"AMP recognises that it has a corporate responsibility to seek to reduce its environmental footprint including greenhouse gas emissions. In 2013, AMP became carbon neutral for the first time. Since then, AMP has maintained its carbon neutral commitment in each subsequent year. Achieving greater performance in this area is the right thing to do as a responsible corporate citizen for our clients, people and community. AMP has targets to reduce scope 1 and 2 emissions by 42% by 2030 (compared to our 2019 base year). We have updated our base year to 2019 to account for the sale of AMP Life, which represents a structural change to our emissions inventory."	Positive
"This target is a combined  target for all 5 former ams sites in Austria, Singapore and Philippines, rolled up form the individual site targets. They represent about 25% of the scope 2 emissions o f ams-OSRAM overall. For ams manufacturing in Austria, Premstaetten, we are purchasing 100% from hydropower. and thus there can be no additional contribution. The target was missed by about 3.8% driven by increased output at two facilities in Singapore.Since ams took over OSRAM only in March 2021 there was no unified system for 2020 yet. We have set common goals for 2021 though."	Positive
"This target reflects the ambition of the former OSRAM business to be CO2 neutral in 2030, reflecting about 70% of all CO2 emissions of ams-OSRAM.The former OSRAM  Environmental System covered 99% of the impact as assessed and reported in our Sustainability Report. This comprises our relevant production sites with more than 1400 MWh energy consumption per year,  our company and US headquarters and larger R&D sites. Not in-scope are smaller sales offices and R&D sites. We believe to have reached the practical limits.The target was approved and announced in November 2019, i.e. after the reporting period was finished. https://www.osram-group.com/en/media/press-releases/pr-2019/25-11-2019 The baseline of 265,000 tons CO2 (absolute)  is derived from our FY2019 emissions (268,900 tons CO2) minus divested or closed sites which will no longer appear in our reporting going forward (i.e. FY20, next reporting period)."

"In FY20, we reduced GHG emissions by 14% (131,030 MT of CO2e) compared to last year surpassing our 2.6% target.  The target included Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. The significant reduction was due to decreased train service as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.  While operating levels impacted fuel and electricity consumption, our employees continued to focus on reduced idling and energy consumption wherever possible.The GHG reduction target is set and measured annually to align with a larger goal to achieve a 40% reduction compared to a 2010 baseline. The target includes sources in all categories of our Scope 1 and 2 emissions including all locomotive diesel fuel, traction power for Amtrak's electric trains, electricity, natural gas and steam used in Amtrak facilities, fuels for maintenance equipment, refrigerants, and highway fleet fuel."
