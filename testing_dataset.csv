We have committed  reduce scope 3 GHG emissions 48% per product sold from the use of sold products from our 2019 baseline.  Our 2019 baseline is 244 M mt CO2e.
"Our target is to reduce Scope 1, 2, and 3 GHG emissions by 30% by 2030. This is aligned to the UNFCCC and our commitments to The Fashion Pact. A VERY IMPORTANT EXPLANATION OF OUR PROGRESS ON ABSOLUTE EMISSIONS as it relates to 2018, 2019, and 2020:Our First Year to ever analyze our emissions was in 2018, and in 2019 we published our Group's first Sustainability Report using 2018 figures verified by an independent third-party (Deloitte) and published on our website.  Our 2018 emissions were limited to Scope 1 and 2 but EXCLUDED  our fully-owned China facility and the production facility where we outsource production in Mexico. This is important to note because about 50% of Group revenues are generated at this Mexico facility. In 2020 (reporting period for this questionnaire), we continued to dig into and analyze our global emissions. We continue only to measure Scope 1 and 2 and have been able to include emissions from China operations. HOWEVER, the Mexico facilities that generate about 50% of our revenues are still owned by a third party, which, as we understand and have been confirmed by the Consultants who advise us, should be treated as Scope 3 emissions and are thus NOT INCLUDED in 2020 emissions."
"In 2020, Celestica committed to a new company-wide target to reduce absolute Scope 3 GHG emissions from fuel and energy-related activities, purchased goods and services, and upstream and downstream transportation and distribution 10% by 2025 from a 2018 base year. This has been approved and is in line with the 1.5C Science-Based Target initiative (SBTi). Our goal is to reduce our total emissions from the Scope 3 categories mentioned above from 306,176 metric tonnes of CO2e to 275,558 metric tonnes of CO2e. In 2020, our total emissions from these categories were 586,978 metric tonnes of CO2e using a market-based approach. Our base year Scope 3 emissions were estimated based on the data we had at the time of setting the target. Since then, we have improved our data collection methods and now have more refined data, hence why our 2020 Scope 3 emissions are higher than our base year emissions. We will continue to obtain more refined data from our supply chain. This target covers 68.7% of our total Scope 3 emissions from the base year which includes the categories that we are most able to control and that make up a significant portion of our emissions inventory. The categories that are not covered by the target are capital goods, waste generated from operations, business travel, employee commuting, processing of sold products, and use of sold products."
"A meta estipulada de reduzir 5% as emissões de CO2 da Frota Scapini  em nível Nacional tendo como parâmetro a geração das emissões do ano de 2019 foi atingida, sendo que conseguimos contribuir com esta ação mais sustentável. O Projeto de Compensação de Créditos de Carbono estava previsto para iniciar no ano de 2020, porém foi iniciado em janeiro de 2021."
"Abs2 is aligned with Goal 13, Climate Action: UN Sustainable Development Goals. Abs2 is also aligned with science-based target setting, specifically using the sectoral decarbonization approach - we completed unofficial validation of this target with SBTi."
"We have set ourselves science-based target with year 2017 as base year. The targets were approved in 2019. Our main focus has been to reduce scope 1  emissions especially related to fuel usage for energy generation in  our operations. Over the years, we have been having back-up gensets in our network equipment. This is due to power instability in most areas of the country. However, to reduce fuel usage in stand-by generators we continue to invest in clean and renewable energy solutions as well as hybrid energy solutions where generators are not used to power the sites but rather to charge deep cycle batteries for use during power outages. Deep cycle batteries We have also worked connecting most of our sites to electricity from national grid (largely green from Hyro and geothermal). This has reduced the need to use gensets especially in remote sites."
"PLEASE NOTE, as explained in C0.1, on January 7, 2021, Devon and WPX Energy, Inc. (WPX) completed an all-stock merger of equals. Financial and operational performance data, such as production, revenue and emissions, provided in this document exclude amounts related to WPX's assets unless otherwise noted due to the Merger closing subsequent to December 31, 2020. However, certain prospective information included within this document is reflective of the post-merger company. The above target was established in 2021 following the merger with WPX. As such, the ""Covered emissions in base year"", ""Covered emissions in reporting year"", and ""% of target achieved"" are estimates for the post-merger, combined company and are subject to change. Pro-forma performance metrics, including the target baseline and historical performance, will be disclosed in Devon's 2021 Sustainability Report to be released later this year. As noted above, financial and operational performance throughout the rest of this report excludes amounts related to WPX's assets, unless otherwise noted. In June 2021, Devon established a target to achieve net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for Scopes 1 and 2 by 2050. Since our founding in 1971, Devon has been at the forefront of technological innovation in the oil and natural gas industry. The company's long history of using advanced technologies to improve efficiencies across the business will be key to delivering on our ambition to achieve net zero GHG emissions for Scopes 1 and 2 by 2050.In pursuit of continued transparency, Devon will refresh our Climate Change Assessment Report by year-end 2021, outlining our approach to proactively address climate-related risks and opportunities."
"Huhtamaki is aiming to reach carbon neutral production by 2030. We are taking a holistic approach: we avoid emissions, reduce emissions and replace energy sources by shifting to renewable energy."
"KEPCO greenhouse gas reduction target is the same as the one submitted in 2019, and various activities are being carried out with the goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 2020."
"A specific reduction of Scope 2 emissions by 20% was chosen as a marker for measuring relative progress toward our overall goal of 20% total emissions reduction.Viavi is under construction on a new Manufacturing site going live in 2022, in Chandler, AZ. To decrease the impact of C02 we are considering adding solar to the new site. Additionally, we have a commitment to take our Suzhou site 100% renewable in the next two years which will decrease our CO2 by over 2000 tons."
"To address Sidel Group's scope 1+2 emissions, one target has been set. The proposed target intends to reduce absolute emissions 30% by 2030 from a 2019 base year, and is modelled using the absolute Contraction approach. The chart compares the target against two long term Absolute Contraction temperature pathways. The ambition of the proposed scope 1 and 2 target exceeds the minimum ambition for the well-below 2°C pathway in the target year of 2030 and is therefore considered ambitious. Using the Absolute Contraction Approach, the targets covering scope 1+2 emissions are classified as well-below 2°C aligned."
"L'Oréal Chairman and CEO announced in 2015 that the Group would completely balance its CO2 emissions from production and finished goods transportation by 2020, to become a carbon-balanced company.The Group now pursues a twofold approach to reduce its carbon footprint:1. Reducing emissions linked to its industrial activities by 60% by 2020, from a 2005 baseline, through the increasing use of renewable energy and improvements in the energy efficiency of its industrial sites (see objective above Abs 3);2. Counterbalancing by 2020 the rest of its emissions by generating carbon gains through the sustainable sourcing of raw materials in partnership with its suppliers, supporting them in their low carbon transition process. With this new ambition, L'Oréal aims to balance its incompressible CO2 emissions (around 400,000 tonnes per year). This innovative approach is rolled-out through a range of projects with three focal points: improving energy efficiency, promoting low-carbon agriculture, developing sustainable forestry projects.To ensure its approach is effective, L'Oréal has put together an expert committee of independent carbon specialists. This target covers 100% of emissions in Scope 1, Scope 2, and downstream transportation of products in Scope 3. It covers medium timeframe so as to completely counterbalance its CO2 emissions from production by 2020, and continue until 2030 within the scope of our Science-Based Targets.In 2020, it was estimated that the nine energy and forestry projects in place generated carbon savings of 405,241 tonnes CO2 equivalent, thus achieving our 2020 target. Identification of CO2 hotspots in raw materials supply chains, scoping studies, training webinars and call for project proposals have been set up and shared with suppliers. Statutory Auditors verified all data related to the Carbon Balanced programme at the end of 2020.NB: The percentage of target achieved in 2020 is negative because we have exceeded the planned target by generating more carbon savings than the carbon emissions on the considered perimeter."
"As a state enterprise owned by Ministry of Finance (majority shareholder), PTT has developed GHG target (Scope 1+2 GHG Emission) in accordance with country's NAMAs (7%-20% GHG reduction against BAU in 2020) and NDC (20%-25% GHG reduction against BAU in 2030). Greenhouse gas emission target of the PTT Group in 2030 was revised from the previous 20% reduction target to 27% reduction target, compared to the business-as-usual scenario. (2030 PTT Business as usual emission is expected to be 62.3 MtCO2e, PTT has set GHG target to control GHG emission below 50 MtCO2e).In 2020, PTT emitted scope 1+2 GHG emission around 30.2 MtCO2e, which is lower 2019 PTT GHG BAU emission and target emission. For science-based target setting, one of PTT Flagship company, GC, has committed to set its target in accordance to   science-based target since 2016. GC established the long-term strategy on climate change using Science Based Target to mitigate GHG intensity target reduction of 52% by 2050 from the base year of 2012."
"The previous reduction target was achieved ahead of schedule and a new target was set at a 35% decrease, based on end-of-2013 values, by the end of 2025. This new target amounts to 5.25 tCO2e per full time employee (FTE). It is important to note that some targets and achievements are disclosed in the Nedbank TCFD report as normalized figures, but Nedbank uses absolute figures and targets. Furthermore, the bank's long-term goals are being aligned to the United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), which includes scenario analysis and potentially Science Based Targets, but this is still an on-going endeavour. One reasons for this is that the applicability of the Science Based Target Initiative (SBTI) model is still being investigated. Nedbank is also operationally carbon neutral. The internal actions and carbon neutrality is considered to be over and above what is necessary for a science based target. The coverage of the carbon footprint and carbon neutral endeavour is 100% of the operational carbon footprint."
"Through the implementation of the energy saving and emission reduction program in 2020, the company's actual emissions will be 5,531 tons of CO2-equivalent/year, compared to the total emissions of 9,325 tons of CO2-equivalent/year in 2010, a reduction of 3,794 tons of CO2-equivalent/year, a reduction ratio of 40.7%. In addition to the total amount, CCI also focuses on the relative indicator, which is calculated as the monthly average CO2 emissions per $10,000 of revenue, by converting the power consumption and transportation fuel in the plant into CO2-equivalent and then dividing it by the total revenue for the month. From January 2014 to the present, CO2 emissions per $10,000 of revenue have shown a year-on-year decreasing trend."
"The California cap-and-trade program ensures that GHG targets are met by setting an emissions limit – a declining cap – on 85% of emissions, primarily transportation, industry, and electricity generation emissions. Emitters must have sufficient allowances to meet their emissions limit, but how they do that is up to them. The system is not command and control, but rather allows for compliance flexibility and long-term business planning, while the price signals motivate long-term investment in cleaner fuel and energy efficiency. TC Energy incurs costs associated with the cap-and-trade program with respect to our electricity marketing activities.Adherence to this program inherently drives us to reduce emissions (through innovation, technology or other practices/procedures), or accept increased financial obligations.The ambitions of the California cap-and-trade program to pursue a science-based target are unknown."
In 2018 we established a new 2023 target to reduce absolute emissions by 10%.
"TARGET -  Our Business Travel will operate with net zero carbon emission from 2030.We have set this target to ensure that the operational impact from our business travel will reduce over the next 10 years to achieve net zero emissions from 2030, which is ahead of the current 2050 national/international targets and aligns with the principles of science based targets based on the SBTi guidance. As the financial sector guidance for SBTs was only released last year we have not yet had this target approved by the SBTi but we have formally and publicly signed up to the SBTi and are working through their target submission process.Please note our business travel significantly reduced from 7,223 in 2019 to 3,045 in 2020. This was directly impacted by the Covid 19 pandemic.The target covers 100% of our scope 3 Business Travel footprint."
"We developed market-based carbon targets that were approved by the Science-Based Targets Initiative in February 2019. Our previous science-based target for scope 1 and 2 was to ""reduce absolute scope 1 & 2 GHG emissions by 22% by 2025, from a 2016 baseline.""The target covered 97% of our scope 1 and 2 emissions (emissions from purchased and consumed electricity and heat; property gas and other fuels; and haulage from dedicated delivery fleets). We achieved a 27% reduction in 2020/21 from our 2016/17 baseline, meeting our original science-basedcarbon reduction target ahead of schedule. This is a large movement from the previous year (FY 19/20: 18%), driven in part by the temporary closure of stores due to Covid as well as strong underlying improvements.Note that this target has now been replaced with a 1.5 degree aligned target approved by SBTi. Our carbon reduction target is based on the market-based emissions. With the sales of our Castorama Russia business, we have removed emissions associated with that business from previous years, including our 2016/17 baseline. In 2018, we took the decision to no longer report our emissions from business travel by road;  these represent less than 5% of our total scope 1 and 2 emissions and therefore are below our materiality threshold."
"This target is based on Executive Order B-30-15 issued by Governor Brown which established a new statewide goal for California to reduce GHG emissions. These California emission reduction targets are in line with the scientifically established emission reductions needed in the United States to limit global warming below 2 degrees Celsius, to avoid potential major climate disruptions such as super droughts and rising sea levels."
"BEKB has committed to a voluntary energy efficiency and GHG reduction target of 12% (= 86 tons) within the time span 2012-2022 in an agreement with the Swiss Economic Energy Agency, a public-private partnership in Switzerland to implement CO2 legislation. The base year emissions figure for this target has been calculated according to the VfU Indicators version 2015.GHG data for Scope 1+2: GHG emissions base year 2012 = 720 tons. GHG emissions target 2022 = 634 tons. GHG emissions 2020 = 479 tons = >100% complete."
"This target (2013–2036) applies to Scope 1 and 2 emissions in Canada, which includes property-level electricity, natural gas, jet fuel, back-up diesel, and refrigerants consumption at its corporate head office. We are exploring the new Science Based Targets Initiative methodology for financial services companies, and its application to our business."
SBTi validated this target on 3/5/2019.  Schreiber commits to a 27% reduction in Scope 1 & Scope 2 emission of 27% by 2030 (2017 baseline).
Target is to reduce our base line emissions by 40% by 2035 as a part of the 2DC scenario.
"Our target for Scope 1 and 2 aligns with the SBTI absolute contraction method, with the prescribed 4.2% annual linear reduction rate over the target period.  This is in line with the 1.5 degree C long term temperature goal."
Citycon set a Science Based Target in May 2021. The base-year for the target is the same as the reported year although the target was set in 2021.
We aim to source all our energy usage from renewable energy
"We followed CDP recommendations to set two targets, one pre-2035 and one post-2035.  We also followed the CDP guidance for targets to align with the science-based target framework since our industry does not qualify for science-based target certification."
"Based on SBT, the amount of emission in all the businesses of our company including transportation of the lower stream where our company is able to have influence is reduced in the long term."
We aligned our targets with the Absolute Contraction Methode; with our target we exceed the minimum reduction required by this approach.
"For our first -ever emissions reduction targets, we challenged our product teams and production facilities to reduce CO2e from inputs (steel, aluminum, cardboard and shipping fuel) by 15% in a single year (by 2020), and 25% in 3 years (by 2022)."
"In late 2020 SMUD began planning an ambitious goal of delivering carbon neutral electricity in the next decade, creating our 2030 Clean Energy Vision (CEV). To meet our bold CEV goal, SMUD's 2030 Zero Carbon Plan was recently approved, bringing our one-SMUD approach to the forefront of our low-carbon transition commitments; the Plan involved months of Board-level meetings, committee discussions with industry experts, public comments to engage with our stakeholders, and collaborating with our regional partners on how to best achieve our zero-carbon goal."
"The Japan Petroleum Development Association (hereinafter the ''Association”), an industry organization to which JAPEX belongs, participates in the Commitment to a Low Carbon Society formulated by the Japan Business Federation (''Keidanren”)*. In line with the Commitment, we have set the GHG emission reduction targets for the Association as a whole. In fiscal 2020, we set a target of a 5% reduction in GHG emissions compared to fiscal 2005, and in fiscal 2030, a 28% reduction compared to fiscal 2013. To achieve the Association's 2020 target, GHG emissions targets are assigned to its member companies. As a member of the Association, we need to reduce emissions to the level of 137,000 tons or less, which is the target assigned to us. To this end, we have promoted emission reduction activities such as energy saving at production sites and reduction of the vent and flare emissions. As a result, our GHG emissions in fiscal 2020 were 127,176 tons**, which was lower than the target of 137,000 tons, thus achieving the target assigned to us for fiscal 2020. Status of achievement of the GHG emission target for the Association is being compiled.* Keidanren consists of more than 100 leading Japanese industrial associations. It is promoting GHG reduction by positioning global warming countermeasures as a key policy issue. The Association is one of the member organizations of Keidanren.** As the current GHG reduction target for the Association has several limiting conditions such that emissions are limited to those from the domestic E&P business and excludes concomitant CO2, the scope of the target does not coincide with the total amount of our Scope 1 & 2 emissions.***The GHG reduction  target in fiscal 2020 for the Association as  a whole is to reduce emissions by 5% from the fiscal 2005 level (222,674 tons-CO2e) to 211,540 tons CO2e or less.Our quota for fiscal 2020 is to limit our emissions to 137,000 tons CO2e or less, and we have achieved this target, but this means that we are allowed to increase our emissions by 27% from the 2005 level of 107,560 tons CO2e."
We re-set our SBT in 2018 to account for acquisitions as well as to align with a 1.5-degree scenario.
"Tele 2 submitted our targets to SBT in December 2020 and the targets were approved in 2021.  Therefore we consider this a SBT although it was not yet approved during the reporting year. By reducing our GHG emissions in scope 1&2 by 90% between 2019 and 2025 it qualifies as being 1.5 degree aligned. Abs 1 is a sub-target to the longer Abs 2 target. Both targets are included in the targets submitted to the SBTi.Included in the target are the markets in Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia and Sweden which are the continuing operations. The coverage of base-year emissions for Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia and Sweden is 100%. Note that the target does not include the markets in Croatia, Germany or Kazakhstan as Tele 2 no longer operates in those markets. The target coverage reported for the base year is 48% due to operations in Croatia, Germany and Kazakhstan at the time."
"Even though SBTi is not applied to setting the group's emission target, Hana Financial Group voluntarily established a carbon neutrality plan with an annual emission reduction target of 2.8 % until 2050 which is more stringent than the target of 2.5 % recommended by SBTi (based on the well-below 2°C alignment). The mid-term target in 2030 is closely linked with the long-term target in 2050."
Abs1????Abs2???????????
This target is based on waste generated at product use at our customer's operations. We have started a process of recovering spent liner (both PET and paper based) to guarantee proper recycling and avoid landifll as end of life scenario. We currently recycle about 1500t of liner with avoided emissions for 2t of CO2e per ton of spent liner.
"SPAR has committed to science-based targets for two sectors: buildings and transport, and has developed a number of scenarios for setting targets, i.e. at 1% growth versus 2.5% growth and at intervals from 2016 (base year) to 2025, 2035 and 2050 on both absolute and intensity emissions We have reported on our 1% growth, absolute emissions reduction by 2050 SBT's in this question for the BUILDINGS sector. The SPAR Group is reviewing Science Based Targets to align them with the revised 1.5°C instead of 2°C target, and these will be reported in the next year's disclosure.In 2016 (base year), Scope 2 emissions associated with electricity consumption were used to set the target for BUILDINGS SECTOR. The target is for SPAR to achieve 44 098 tCO2e reduction by 2050 against base year emissions. Progress on target is evaluated by considering FY2020 Scope 2 emissions against base year Scope 2 emissions."
"Kazan Soda aims to reduce total eCO2 emissions of sodium carbonate and sodium bicarbonate  production in Turkey  from 2018,base year, to  2030 by %25 by implementing new energy efficiency projects , using renewable energy sources  and increasing bicarbonate production capacity for increasing CO2 consumption because while production of bicarbonate, CO2 is used.By conducting these studies,new energy efficiency projects , renewable energy sources  and bicarbonate production, we have reduced our GHG  emissions by 6.62 % compared to the base year 2018.We are consider this target as Science Based Target,but it is not reporting to Science Based Target because as a Kazan Soda  we are joining toThe Climate Ambition Accelerator Program which is a six-month accelerator programme for companies participating in the United Nations Global Compact who are looking to make progress towards setting science-based emissions targets and create a clearpath to address their organization's transition to net-zero.After the program is completed , we will set our Science Based Targets.Carbon emissions of individual activities of Kazan Soda's employees the offset in 2020 via carbon offset projects. Verra, in its capacity as administrator of the Verra Registry, does hereby certify that on 05 Feb2021, 3,500 Verified Carbon Units (VCUs) were retired on behalf of 700 employees of KAZAN SODA ELEKTR?K ÜRET?M A.?.Name of the  carbon offset project is Kargilik 24 MW Hydropower Plant which is located in TurkeyIn 2019, approximately 30,040 trees were planted around the factory, including Cypress, Juniper, Acacia, Rose, Cedar, Larch and Fruit Trees to reduce carbon emissions.Within the scope of sustainability studies, natural life mammals and aquatic creatures, birds, ecosystem plants, endemic and indicator species were determined and recorded by field observations and camera traps by expert academicians. Bird, reptile, amphibian, fish and mammal species that are present within the licence area are monitored seasonally .Lynx,Red FoxiWolf and Anatolian Ground Squirrels are some mammal species identifed in the licence area.It is tried to raise awareness for sustainability by giving  trainings about sustainability to the employee."
"In 2020, Neste committed to reducing and compensating emissions from its employee business flights through the use of the company's own sustainable aviation fuel (Neste MY Sustainable Aviation Fuel). Neste MY Sustainable Aviation Fuel reduces emissions by up to 80 % compared to fossil jet fuel over the lifecycle. The commitment will be implemented through aviation partnerships. Neste has already joined KLM's corporate biofuel program in 2019. In addition, we announced our partnership with Finnair in March 2020. To fulfill this commitment for 2020, Neste has put in place arrangements to supply approximately 500 metric tons of SAF in Europe and North America to the airlines most frequently used by Neste (including Finnair), leading to an estimated GHG emission reduction of 1,500 tons of CO2 equivalent globally compared to using fossil jet fuel over the life cycle. No regulatory incentives have been claimed for the supplied SAF, and thus the achieved emission reduction is incremental to that achieved by any governmental policies.Neste does not report Scope 3 Category 6 emissions separately in the Annual Report, but they have been estimated based on travel management data for 2020. Neste MY Sustainable Aviation Fuel reduces emissions by up to 80 % compared to fossil jet fuel over the lifecycle, so the absolute reduction target for Neste's estimated business travel emissions is 80 % of the baseline."
"Actualmente estamos trabajando en implemtar maquinas que sean amigables con el medio ambiente, aumentando la capacidad instalada, nuevo diseños en el empaque para reducir los residuos,para mejorar las condiciones de temperatura de los productos y  las condiciones de calidad del producto."
"Following the adoption of several measures including 100% use of electricity derived from renewable sources across its French sites, the Group has set itself a new greenhouse gas reduction target, encompassing energy, transportation and procurement, by 2020. Scope 3 corresponds to business travel (air, train). This requires each Group entity to implement action plans to reduce energy consumption in their buildings and data centers, as well as the carbon footprint of employee travel.The action plans taken at the various entities have been successful as the greenhouse gas emissions of scope 1 and scope 2 have decreased by 3% and 8% between 2016 and 2019.In 2020, operating emissions fell drastically due to the health crisis, by 12% (scope 1) and 4% (scope 2) respectively compared to 2019, or by 12% (scope 1) and 15% (scope 2) compared to 2016. Also compared to 2016, emissions on the energy and transport items having decreased by 16% and 87% respectively, we recorded a drop of 37% in our total direct emissions.As our five years targets (2016-2020) have been achieved, we have set new targets aligned with our NZBA commitment. These new targets will be submitted for approval to the SBTi.  Three milestones will therefore be set up : for 2025, 2030 and 2050."
"Klépierre's third new ambition, certified SBTi is to reduce GHG emissions for its tenanted space by at least 3% per square meter per year over the 2017-2030 target period. This corresponds to a 46% change in absolute emissions for the scope 3 tenanted space category.Calculation details:- Scope 3 emissions from downstream leased assets: 2017: 311,850 tCO2e 2020: 108,309 tCO2e- tCO2e reduced so far: 311,850 - 108,309= 202,541tCO2e- tCO2e that have to be reduced by 2030: 311,850 - 311,850x(1-0,46) = 143,451tCO2e- % achieved: 202,541 / 143,451= 142%"
The target covers all scope 1 & 2 global operational emissions
"We recognise the risks from climate change and the importance of reducing our carbon footprint and in 2020 have published our 2030 carbon reduction targets, approved by the Science Based Targets initiative. During 2020, due mainly to the impacts of Covid-19 on our industry, our absolute Scope 1, 2 and 3 (FERA) GHG emissions from our owned, leased and managed hotels fell by 23%, from a 2018 base year (against a 2030 reduction target of 15%), and our Scope 3 GHG emissions from our franchised hotels fell by 18% per square metre, from a 2018 base year (against a 2030 reduction target of 46% per square meter). Covid-19 has significantly impacted occupancy levels across our estate and required intermittent hotel closures in many locations, which in turn has significantly lowered our carbon footprint  for the year. As the industry recovers, we will continue to focus on achieving our carbon reduction goals by driving energy efficiency in our hotels and increasingly looking at renewable energy solutions.We report Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 emissions as defined by the GHG protocol: • Scope 1 emissions are direct emissions from the burning of fuels or from refrigerant losses by the emitter.• Scope 2 emissions are indirect emissions generated by the energy purchased or acquired by the emitter.• Scope 3 emissions are indirect emissions that occur in a company's value chain."
"In 2020, Domtar's pulp and paper mills reduced total direct (Scope 1) and indirect (Scope 2) greenhouse gas emissions from purchased energy 27% from 2010 levels, achieving our goal of a 15% reduction from 2010 levels by the end of 2020 for a fifth consecutive year."
"Covered emissions in 2019 base year were rebaselined and updated to 12,117,585. Crown has committed to reduce absolute Scope 3 GHG emissions from Purchased Goods and Services by 16% by 2030 from a 2019 baseline."
"In the beginning of 2021, we announced the intent to acquire Alliance Healthcare, formerly a part of the Walgreens Boots Alliance family. The acquisition was finalized in June 2021.  With the announcement of a new acquisition that would significantly change our carbon footprint, we determined it would not make sense to submit a formal target to the Science Based Target initiative (SBTi) until the acquisition was finalized and we could include our Alliance Healthcare footprint in our target. We made the decision to set a short-term target for the AmerisourceBergen portfolio inclusive of Scope 1 and 2 emissions for the interim while we determine our new global footprint including Alliance Healthcare. This interim target, a 5% reduction by the end of FY2022, was developed in line with the SBTi's criteria and guidelines. We have formally committed to set a science-based target through SBTi and plan to submit within the next year. Note on Target Status: While we have achieved a significant reduction year on year beyond the goal target, this is in part due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in the temporary closure of many of our offices and facilities as well as a reduction in fuel use. While we have continued to advance our efficiency improvements at our distribution centers, we do anticipate our emissions to rise slightly as we ''return to normal” and our offices reopen."
"This target replaces target Abs 2.  The ‘Covered emissions in the ‘reporting year' field of this target include total emissions for L3Harris, which includes the combined data for L3 Technologies and Harris Corporation.  This target was developed using the tool created by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) and meets the science-based level of ambition criteria required to limit the global temperature increase to 2.0°C, using the absolute contraction approach. The target has not yet been verified by the SBTi."
"The target includes emission categories describe the source of emissions and who has primary, secondary or tertiary command over these sources: Scope 1: GHG emissions from sources that are owned or controlled by company and  Scope 2: GHG emissions resulting from the generation of electricity, heat or steam purchased by the company. We have considered 3 perspectives in order to set aspirational but also achievable emission targets: (1) Policy perspective: This is related to aspirations set by and between governments (e.g., Paris agreement, U Green Deal, Greek National Energy Plan).  EU and Greek policy makers target an emission reduction of ~50% by 2030 and carbon neutrality (-100% of emission) by 2050 (compared to 2019 levels). .  (2) Industry leaders perspective: This is related to what leading companies in sustainability are doing and aspiring. Best in class competitors typically target >50% decarbonization by 2030, and full decarbonization by 2050. (3) Mytilineos perspective: This is related to Mytilineos own unique starting position, performance, strategy and business plans. Given the different nature of our activities, we have taken into account the specificities of each business unit. For each of the BUs, we consider their current and expected baseline, characteristics of their business and  changes in the system they operate in.The target is considered science based because it complies with the requirements of Well-below 2°C aligned scenario as described in Science-Based Targets Initiative Tool and in 2021, MYTILINEOS plans to submit a Letter of Commitment to the ''Science Based Targets Initiative” for submitting the above-mentioned target regarding the reduction of its carbon dioxide emissions to external independent verification, to assure they have been calculated on a scientific basis."
"This is the medium-term, Scope 3 Business Travel component of our legacy science based target. This carbon target was to reduce our carbon footprint by 80% by 2050, though we have set two shorter term targets: 40% by 2020 and 60% by 2030. The scope covers all our reported scope 1 and 2 emissions as well as the majority of elements from our scope 3 fuel and energy and business travel. Expressed as an approximate year on year equivalent, these are 4.54% by 2020, 4.27% by 2030 and 3.85% by 2050. Please note, in 2019 we expanded the scope of our reporting to include additional elements which would fall within category 6, not previously accounted for. This includes colleague use of hotels, taxis and upstream emissions associated with sourcing fuels used in colleague business travel. These new elements are not in scope of our present target, thus our target coverage is 76.34%. 141.58% reduction versus 2009 baseline = 141.58% of 60% reduction target. We acknowledge that the very early completion of this target is largely due to business travel reductions as a result of the Covid 19 pandemic. We have subsequently increased our ambitions to reduce our operational climate impact and as part of revised climate pledges, Lloyds Banking Group aim to maintain a 50% reduction in all travel (business and colleague commuting) compared to 2018/19, essentially maintaining the level of reduced travel seen throughout 2020."
"ClAir-ISThe Clean Air Industrial Site (CLAIR-IS) program operates at MTU's headquarters in Munich. The target was, to reduce the CO2 emissions at the company's largest plant by 25% by 2020 (baseline year: 1990).In total, within the 30 years we have saved some 545,000 metric tons of CO2. That corresponds to 29%.This is how CLAIR-IS measures are calculated: 1. For the base year, we set the emissions as 100%.2. We undertake actions to save emissions such as     a) take into operation a bio fuel driven cogeneration plant     b) connect new cooling load to our well water cooling system (instead of using electric compressor cooling)     c) refurbish buildings, add new insulation     d) Reduce compressed air leaks     e) Exhibit machines completely3. We calculate the CO2-reduction effect (wherever possible: we measure)."
This target is set to address the emissions of our trucking of goods. We are looking at how we can require the use of fuel-efficient vehicles and aerodynamic designs to decrease fuel usage.
This targets supports our progress towards Net Zero GHG emissions (NZ1 & NZ2) Reduction of 90% compared to base year by 2040 is in line with science.
The absolute target includes scope 3 emissons from the natural gas that we supplied and is a financial year target. The absolute target is additional to our earlier SBTi-approved relative targets. Since 2017 we report our progress on this absolute target in our Annual Report and One Planet Plan.
"Yap? Kredi aimed to reduce the sum of Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions of the Head Office buildings (Plaza Building D and Banking Base) and three service buildings (Dar?ca Archive Building, Bayramo?lu Training Facilities, Yeniköy Grove) by 15% in 2025 compared to 2015. In this target, total emissions were reduced by 59.49% in 2020, compared to the base year. In 2020, Yap? Kredi updated its 15-year target as stated above within the scope of its low carbon transition plan.  This update was performed due to three reasons. The first reason is that the target has been revised in line with the commitment to reach the goal of 1.5 degrees Celsius with science based targets. Yap? Kredi is the first company in Turkey, committed to Business Ambition for 1.5. The second reason is that the previous target only covers the Head Office buildings and three service buildings. The scope of the new target has been expanded to include all locations which are branches, ATMs located in branches and ATMs within the region of branches, and subsidiaries in addition to headquarters buildings and service buildings. The last reason is that the base year for Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions of all locations verified in accordance with the ISO 14064 standard has been changed from 2015 to 2019. Yap? Kredi aims to reduce its Scope 1 and Scope 2 absolute carbon emissions by 100% by 2035, compared to 2019. In the reporting year, a 17% reduction rate is achieved in total of Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions with implementing LED lighting systems, and offsetting its Scope 2 emissions of 6,991.5 tCO2e with I-REC in 2020.  In order to achieve the zero emission target, it is planned to perform a transition on the heating systems of the branches which are currently using air conditioners for heating purposes. Projects are being developed to enable renewable energy generation at the Banking Base and some branches through installing solar energy panels on the roofs of these buildings. Additionally, the following actions are planned to be taken in the upcoming years in order to meet the designated target:•Gradually switching to hybrid vehicles in company car fleet •Purchasing carbon certificates to offset for unavoidable Scope 1 emissionsScope 3 emissions are not covered by the designated target yet, but Yap? Kredi has initiated a study for calculation of its Scope 3 emissions related to its portfolio."

"Our Science Based Target is to reduce carbon emissions associated with Scope 1 and 2 emissions is to be zero by 2030. Our 2017 baseline carbon footprint was 6,298 tonnes, our reported carbon footprint this year is 3,397 tonnes which represents a 46% reduction vs the baseline. However, our operations have been effected by COVID so we are not able to account for this reduction purely through our reduction initiatives."
"We are proud to have reached our original target of 35% in 2020 by reducing our Scope 1 & 2 GHG emissions by 37%.Our next level commitment for 2030 has been established, whereby we will achieve a reduction of 60% and operational carbon neutrality by 2050."
"REN has a target associated with the reduction of SF6 leakages in its high voltage equipment to 0.15% in 2012. Leakage rate is defined as the ratio between the SF6 mass effectively leaked into the atmosphere and the total quantity installed in REN's substations. Taking into account the importance of this GHG, in 2013, REN has redefined this target in order to achieve a reduction to a leakage rate of 0,02% in 2020. In 2020 the leakage rate was 0,044%.In 2019 REN committed to set science-based emissions reduction targets across all relevant scopes, in line with 1.5°C emissions scenarios under the United Nations Global Compact ''Business Ambition for 1,5ºC” initiative and in 2020 has been working in the sbti target defintion."
"LGU+ aims to reduce annual emissions by 2.1% to 606,035 tCO2e by 2040, 41.2% smaller than the base year."
"NORDEN's target of a 100% reduction in CO2 emissions  in 2050 is in alignment  with the Danish government's climate partnership with the Danish maritime sector defining a climate ambition of 2050 carbon neutrality. NORDEN applauds this ambition, and under our Sustainability Strategy, we will also work towards this goal by engaging in various partnerships.  The increase in CO2 emissions is mainly due to an increased activity level  with a larger operated fleet. NORDEN has for several years worked to optimise the energy efficiency of its fleet, however,  the Danish shipping sector's ambition of carbon neutrality in 2050 calls for an industry-wide collaborative approach as well as alternative solutions such as low-carbon fuel and wind sail technology.  NORDEN is already engaged in several partnerships with the purpose of accelerating the journey towards offering low-carbon transportation to our customers and has i.a. completed three successful test voyages on biofuel and is aiming  to be one of the first companies to offer this fuel type."
"This combined scope 1 and scope 2 absolute emissions reduction target is a science-based target, which was set in 2017 and approved by the Science Based Targets Initiative. It replaced the following 2020 targets, which were on track to be significantly exceeded:  Scope 1: Reduce direct fuel consumption by 26% by 2020 against a 2010 baseline through fuel efficient choice and driving behaviour.Achieved: absolute emissions in 2016 were 8,535.36 tCO2e compared to 2010 baseline, 23,480tCO2.This represented a 63% reduction achieved compared to 26% target.Scope 1: Reduce bulk fuel purchase and use by 26% by 2020 against a 2010 baseline, through ecosite establishment, equipment selection and behaviour.Achieved: absolute emissions of 8,665.40 tCO2e in 2016 compared with 10,581tCO2e in 2010, our baseline year.This represented a 18% reduction achieved compared to 26% targetScope 2: Reduce direct electricity consumption by 26% by 2020 against a 2010 baseline, through installation of energy efficient devices and behavioural change.Achieved: absolute emissions of 6,934.73 tCO2e in 2016 compared with 25288 tCO2e in 2010, our baseline year.This represented a 27% reduction achieved compared to 26% target."
CIE procurement policy established to look for electrical energy coming from renewable sources.
"Our target cover 100% of our headquarter functions, all our 4 production sites, 3 research, development and administrative sites in USA and one administrative site in Poland. Our sales affiliates are not covered by the target. Our sales affiliates constitute app. 5% of our total GHG emissions.As this target ended in 2020, we have developed a new Science based target during 2020. The new Science Based Target have been approved by Science Based Targets initiative and was announced in February 2021."
"The target covers comapny-wide emissions in all operations. In 2020 Veidekke committed to verify its company-wide scope 1, 2 and 3 targets through the Science Based Target initiative (SBTi) before the end of November 2022."
"We have committed through the Fashion Industry Charter for Climate Action to achieve 30% aggregate GHG emission reductions in Scope 1, 2, and 3 of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Standard by 2030, against a baseline of 2017.  We do not update our calculation of every Scope 3 category each year. In 2017, Scope 3 accounted for 97% of our total GHG, primarily driven by Category 1 purchased goods and services. In 2020, we updated Category 1.  Note that some other categories of Scope 3 were heavily impacted by COVID closures and restrictions, e.g. employee commuting and business travel, and would be even lower than is shown here."
Our target is to become carbon neutral across our operations for Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 2030 or sooner.
"A new target covering Westpac New Zealand Limited (WNZL) Scope 1, Scope 2 and mandatory Scope 3 sources was set in 2019 as part of the carbonzero certification process. The target was set following the Toit? carbonzero program rules."
"We have a target to reduce total energy consumption by 20% by 2025 from a 2019 base year, with an interim target of reducing energy by 10% by 2022. Our carbon reduction targets are to reduce scope 1 emissions by 3% by 2021 from a 2019 base year, and scope 2 emissions by 7% by 2021 from a 2019 base year. We also have a target to source all (100%) electricity from renewable sources by 2025. Target coverage includes all scope 1 and 2 emissions with no exclusions. We have made our scope 1 and 2 and business travel carbon neutral since 2012 and are committed to continue this."
"Our ambition is to reduce carbon emissions from our internal operations by 30% by 2023 and more than 50% by the end of 2030 compared to 2019 and achieve net positive carbon contribution in 2030 (through offsetting). We consider this target 1,5C aligned through comparing with trajectories from IPCC SR 1.5, UNEP Emissions Gap Report, Business Playbook for 1,5 degrees and SBTi criteria for SMEs. Covered emissions are the full carbon footprint for internal operations as reported annually from 2019 and which includes carbon emissions from our operations in Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden, Poland, Estonia and Luxembourg because this is where we have our main operations and where we have operational control. This covers 99% of our employees. Data for fuel and energy consumption includes headquarters, head offices and data centres. Also included is car use, business travel, postal services, paper and water consumption. Branch offices energy use is not included because we have some challenges in retrieving correct data for those. Our ambition is to include them as soon as we have reliable data. Already in 2019 we reduced our total carbon footprint, despite an increase in scope to also include postal services, paper and water. Following this reduction, our total emissions of 15,898 tonnes CO2e in 2020 marked a 62% reduction from 2019 even though waste was added to the scope in 2020. The reduction in carbon emissions was mainly due to Nordea's travel policy in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The reduction will continue going forward, even though we expect business travel activities to increase somewhat in 2021 from the significantly low levels in 2020."
"Compared to FY18 the overall scope 1 emissions from inside facility manufacturing operations is 4.42% less in FY20.  We have achieved 91% of the target of 5% scope 1 emission reduction  from base year FY18. Since we included Hyderabad and vizag site emissions for this reporting year, the additional emissions had impacted the overall reduction compared to target year 2018, where these 2 sites were not in reporting scope. We had achieved the target of 5% scope 1 emission if we take same baseline 2018 reporting scope."
"Exelon established this third generation GHG goal in 2017 to reduce its emissions from internal operations (100% of emissions controllable by our employees and processes) 15% from a 2015 baseline by 2022 (2.2% reduction per year).   At the time, a 2.2% year over year reduction was recommended by the EPA to be in line with the Paris Accord. Our goal was intended to be achieved be despite new equipment coming online due to business growth expected in 2018.  The actual public facing goal is on Market-based accounting, allowing for use of clean energy purchases to be part of performance, but per CDP requirements, the goal is being reported here based on absolute location-based accounting.  Emissions sources covered by this goal includes all building and support equipment electricity uses, emergency and auxiliary stationary combustion sources, fleet vehicles, natural gas distribution systems, SF6 electrical insulated equipment, and refrigerant sources.  Our controllable emissions were 10.5% of our technical Scope 1 & 2 inventory. However, emissions not included under this goal are those we own but do not have direct control over and which are measured and managed under different GHG emissions programs and considered to be customer-driven.  These emission sources include our Scope 1 emissions from electric generation since the level of operation for these units is determined by grid demand for electricity and resulting plant dispatch as determined by the grid balancing authority (outside of our full operational control since we have a commitment to the grid to be available as needed to meet demand); and Scope 2 emissions associated with transmission and distribution line losses which are primarily driven by the grid emissions rate and the volume of electricity required to be delivered to utility customers (similarly outside of our day-to-day operational control since all of the electricity we deliver is purchased per public utility commission requirements). It should be noted, that for these other sources, Exelon does maintain performance management indicators such as lbs/MWh generated and % loss of MWh delivered are used to ensure a continued focus on GHG emission reduction efforts being implemented.  Looking across these three performance programs ensures ongoing management of emissions across 100% of our corporate-wide GHG inventory."
"In order to align with the latest Net Zero foundations paper published by the SBTi, Telefónica Group increased the ambition of its Scope 3 target by:a) including all Scope 3 emissions into the target; and b) increasing its ambition to ensure the targeted reduction aligned with the 1.5C pathway. To achieve this target, Telefônica Brasil is firmly committed to an open, collaborative relationship with its suppliers. Our commitment to them is based on establishing relations that enable us to jointly have a positive impact on our surroundings, through close collaboration and the sharing of good practices. Since 2019, we have developed a supplier engagement programme with key suppliers, extended in 2020 and scaled in 2021 to cover a greater portion of our supplier base. We gathered information from our suppliers to understand the maturity level of their climate strategies and help them set more ambitious emission reduction targets, to inspire them to take action and offered them a best practices forum to foster innovation and exchange of practices."

"This target covers properties over which Growthpoint has operational control, based on the CY17 portfolio.  The target excludes properties that were divested or acquired during the performance period (CY17 - CY21) to ensure like-for-like comparison."
"We have set targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 10 percent by 2025 and 30 percent by 2030, based on a 2018 baseline (2017 for Paragominas, Alunorte and Albras due to the production embargo at Alunorte and curtailment at Albras and Paragominas). The baseline emissions equal 13.3 million tonnes CO2e and includes direct emissions and indirect emissions from electricity generation (scope 1 and scope 2 emissions). The EU has defined aluminium as a critical raw material for the green transition in Europe. See more in Hydro's Annual Report 2020, page 13 and 89."
"NEPI Rockcastle aims to contribute  to a more sustainable environment,  by reducing the carbon (CO2) footprint of its buildings during both construction and operation.  In 2020, the Group decreased its CO2 footprint by 20% compared to 2019, however, a part of this may be attributed to the reduced operations of the shopping centers. In the scale of global emissions by economic sector, the Group's activity is generating direct emissions mainly through energy consumption (electricity and gas) for heating and cooling, waste disposal and indirect emissions from the transportation used by its visitors. NEPI Rockcastle discharges mainly gas emissions generated by the HVAC equipment in its properties. Such emissions are kept under control and verified according to the law, while no incompliance with maximum legal emissions has been reported. The Group performs regular maintenance and technical verifications of its equipment, and it is committed to investing in new technologies that minimize negative impact on the environment. The Group's sustainability strategy sets ambitious targets for the next decade of activity, the main and most important being to achieve net zero carbon emissions until 2030, materially adjusting the previous target of carbon footprint reduction by 20%. The decision comes in the vanguard of the European Union's plan to make Europe the first climate-neutral continent by 2050. The Group made a long-term  commitment to become carbon neutral by 2030, with the following measures to be implemented: Implement carbon footprint calculation methodology in line with ISO 14064 principles, replace old equipment with new more energy efficient equipment, continue to implement and upgrade LED lighting and sensors solutions, invest in green energy sources such as solar panels, photovoltaic parks and electrical cars charging facilities, use alternative low carbon emission materials and last but not least, deploy a carbon offsetting strategy and implement innovative technical solutions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions."
"We achieved our 2020 target reduction 1 year early. Our target aimed to decrease emissions by 75% (47.23 mt CO2e) by 2020 of our base year emissions (62.97 mt CO2e).  In 2019, our scope 2 market-based emissions totalled 13.42  mt CO2e, a reduction of 78.7%.  The % reduction was calculated via the following formulas: (13.42-62.97)/62.97 = 78.7%.  Therefore, our % achieved toward our goal was calculated as follows: 78.7%/75% =104.9%.  Since we achieved this early, in 2020 we purchased RECs for 100% of our market-based electricity use (Scope 2) emissions."
"In May 2018, we have set a GHG emissions reduction target for fiscal year 2020 that is over the 2°C target covered under the Paris Agreement taking a long-range perspective.We are aiming to20% reduction of GHG emissions by FY2020 compared to FY2013."
"The target was set in Q4 2020. The target covers the asset classes listed equity and corporate bonds of our insurance investment portfolio. The target has been developed in line with the Target-Setting Protocol of the UN-convened Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance which is rooted in climate science, following no / low overshoot pathways of the IPCC Special Report on 1.5°C. We expect the Protocol as well as our targets to become accepted / verified by SBTi during 2021, early 2022.On covered emissions we entered 100% as the targets cover all our emissions under the asset classes we are we currently able to measure GHG emissions. For asset classes like sovereign bonds or private listings methodologies are not yet agreed upon in the sector but Allianz is working to solve this as part of the ASCOR project of Ceres, IIGCC, PRI, AOA, TPI and others."
The climate target and the emission figures cover all emissions from operations of all subsidiaries that have a production facility on site.  Smaller representations or sales offices were not evaluated material due to very low emission figures. The target covers at least 95 % of the worldwide Scope 1/2 emissions from KRONES Group's operations.
"In our updated Climate Change Position Statement in 2020, we committed to addressing our Scope 3 emissions and making a plan to reduce these. In April 2021, Worley signed on to the Business Ambition for 1.5C, a global movement of leading companies aligning their business with the most ambitious aim of the Paris Agreement. This means we commit to net zero Scope 3 emissions by no later than 2050, alongside science-based targets across all relevant scopes and in line with the criteria and recommendations of the Science Based Targets Initiative. Over the next 2 years, we will fully develop our Scope 3 target and get it validated and published by the Science-Based Targets initiative.  Our reported Scope 3 emissions constitute 100% of our known Scope 3 emissions sources and is not our baseline for all Scope 3 emissions. We have however, identified our material Scope 3 emissions through an internal study and have developed a plan to work through all of the remaining Scope 3 categories of the GHG by 2023, in line with SBTi.So far, we have only quantified our material emissions from Scope 3 category 1 (Purchased Goods and Services) and category 6 (Business Travel).  In the next few years, we will quantify all Scope 3 emissions relevant to Worley. This means that our Scope 3 emissions will increase over the coming years as we report more categories of Scope 3."
"Every year, we have a goal of being carbon neutral. As of December 31, 2020, we reached carbon neutrality for 100% of our FY2020 operational emissions, which represent Scope 1 + Scope 2 (market-based) + Scope 3 (business travel, candidate travel, and employee commuting).Abs1 covers Scope 1 + Scope 2 (market-based) + Scope 3 (business travel, candidate travel, and employee commuting). We committed to being carbon neutral in 2007 and we have achieved this goal each year since then. We maintain our commitment to carbon neutrality of our operational footprint first through energy efficiency, second, by signing long-term contracts for renewable energy directly from our utility providers and from renewable energy facilities in the same grid regions as our data centers, and lastly, by investing in high-quality carbon offset projects. In 2020, we achieved 14 consecutive years of carbon neutrality. In 2020, we also neutralized our legacy carbon footprint since our founding, making Google the first major company to be carbon neutral for its entire operating history.We understand that CDP does not acknowledge carbon offsets as a way to reduce emissions, however, we do recognize offsets as a viable and important approach for mitigating our carbon emissions impact, as well as a critical component of our three-tiered carbon neutrality strategy. In June 2021, Google announced that we had joined the Exponential Roadmap Initiative and the Race to Zero. In joining the Race to Zero and the Exponential Roadmap Initiative, Google commits to halving emissions before 2030 towards net zero throughout the value chain. For more details, see https://exponentialroadmap.org/partners."
"In alignment with our sustainability principle to protect our planet, we strive to reduce emissions along our whole value chain. As a leading logistics and transportation company, we have a unique opportunity and ability to continually reduce the environmental impacts of our operations and those of the tens of thousands of customers we serve. Whether we are deploying AFVs, optimizing distribution networks, or operating energy-efficient warehouses and service shops, Ryder helps customer reduce emissions and drive long-term value for their businesses. After meeting our 2020 goal early to reduce Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions 20% over a 2009 baseline, we recently implemented new targets to drive our strategy over the next three years while we finalize our longer term targets. To develop our new emissions targets, we closely tracked and evaluated materials factors that influence our emissions across the value chain. We identified priorities that present the greatest opportunity to reduce emissions and close existing data gaps while evaluating the resources available (and needed) to achieve our goals. Our new goals, which have been reviewed by the Board of Directors, aim to complete the following:-Reduce Scope 1 emissions (company-operated fleet) 10% by 2024, over 2018 baseline;-Reduce Scope 2 emissions (company-operated facilities) 30% by 2024, over 2018 baseline; and,-Reduce Scope 3 emissions (downstream leased equipment) 15% by 2024, over 2018 baseline.The scope 1 target includes Ryder's DTS fleet operations and currently excludes the following fleet activities: UK fleet (2020: 10,256 MTCO2e) and company owned service trucks (319 MTCO2e). Both emissions are included in the emissions reporting."
"This absolute emissions reduction target ""Abs 3"" forms part of our first Net Zero milestone (""NZ1""), and is to achieve Net Zero emissions across our third-party distribution partner site operations by 2025, which we believe can be achieved through a very high % of absolute reduction. We are achieving Net Zero via a 3-stage approach of 'Reduce', 'Convert' & 'Offset' with the latter being avoided where possible and only used where Reduce & Convert aren't possible. Emissions from our third-party distribution partner sites have been calculated to account for 3% of our total Scope 3 (Category 4: Upstream Transportation and Distribution) emissions.We're working to identify what proportion of the emissions in scope we'll need to meaningfully offset, however given the below 3 points we are aiming for an absolute reduction to approx. 200 tonnes CO2e remaining , equivalent to a >90% reduction: 1) By working with our third-party partners to already convert 67.5% of their electricity to renewable we have reduced related carbon emissions by 562 tonnes CO2e, with a further 641 tonnes remaining from sites using non renewable electricity which can be removed.2) The remaining emissions are from use of other fuels (gas, diesel etc) which we hope to be able to also convert to renewable in markets that allow this.3) There will likely be some emissions from refrigerant gases used in site HVAC units. We will explore with our partners the potential to replace these with 'zero carbon' refrigerant alternatives where they exist. Where this is not possible there will be no option other than offsetting these remaining emissions. We have identified this as a bespoke milestone target due to the high levels of influence we have over the operations of these third party sites to reduce their carbon emissions.In order to ensure we have an accurate account of these indirect (Scope 3) emissions we will be undertaking a full Scope 3 assessment and calculation within the next year.From our understanding of climate science we believe that our 'Net Zero' targets align with the science for a 1.5°C trajectory. We intend to formalise this target by calculating & setting a Science Based Target in the next 1-2 years, helping improve our understanding of the decarbonisation pathway and pace required."
"In July 2018, Omron announced in its Science-Based Targets Initiative that it would set a goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions based on scientific evidence. Promote energy-saving measures and proactively introduce renewable energy to achieve the targets.Target value:(1) Zero greenhouse gases in Scope 1 and Scope 2 by 2050.(2)32% reduction by 2030 (compared to 2016)(3)4% reduction by 2020 as the backcast target from that vision.The 2030 and 2050 targets are considering changing from a 2°C scenario to a 1.5°C scenario in line with the standards of the SBT Initiative."
"We have calculated and tracked our scope 1&2 emissions since 2016.   We have committed through the Fashion Industry Charter for Climate Action to achieve a 30 per cent aggregate GHG emission reductions in scope 1, 2 and 3 of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Standard by 2030, against a baseline of no earlier than 2015.  We have additionally committed to Business Ambition for 1.5C through the Science Based Targets Initiative and Race to Zero, committing to set both science-based emissions reduction targets across all scopes and a long-term science-based target to reach net-zero value chain GHG emissions by no later than 2050.  These commitments will be in line with 1.5C emissions scenarios and the criteria and recommendations of the Science Based Targets Initiative."
"Equinix partnered with an external consultant in 2020 to develop our science-based target (SBT) to reduce Scope 3 Fuel and energy-related activities by 50% by 2030 over a 2019 baseline. This 12-year, medium-term target applies to Equinix's global operations. The target setting method applied was Absolute Contraction Approach with a 1.5-degree scenario. As the target was set in late 2020, it is considered as a new target and the percent of target achieved is therefore still negative (-2%). The target has been recently approved by the SBTi at the time of writing this CDP."
"In FY19, Vicinity committed to a Net Zero Carbon Target target by 2030 for our 100% owned assets. The Net Zero target covers the scope 1 and scope 2 carbon emissions from the common mall area of Vicinity's wholly owned centres - that is, the direct emissions within our operational control at these assets.Progress on the target is reported on an Australian Financial Year basis (1 July- 30 June). In the Baseline Year FY16, the scope of the target covered 28% of all scope 1 and scope 2 emission of Vicinity's managed portfolio. In Reporting Year FY20, the scope of target covered 30% of all scope 1 and Scope 2 of Vicinity's managed portfolio. The increase in coverage is the result of divestment of assets since the baseline year/The baseline year for the target is FY16, and is reviewed annually and adjusted based on acquisitions and divestments, in accordance with the guidance within the GHG Protocol. The covered emissions reported above are for FY20 (July 2019 - June 2020).Our Net Zero carbon target will be achieved through energy efficiency programs, and our onsite solar program. Our Net Zero carbon target has short, medium- and long-term targets to monitor how we are progressing against our Net Zero carbon commitment.This target represents our long-term Net Zero target as aligned to Vicinity's business time horizons.  Vicinity has already achieved 31 per cent of the energy reduction requirements for our long term Net Zero carbon target."

"Eramet has developed a Science-Based Target that has been approved by SBT and that is compliant with the WB2C scenario (reduction of absolute CO2e emissions Scope 1+2 by 40% from a 2019 base year to a 2035 target year).The main emissions reduction levers are:-the development of CCS in partnership with other players: this is the action with the greatest impact in terms of CO2 savings, but the cost of these solutions is an obstacle. Therefore, the ambition is to develop a pilot and identify the least capital-intensive technologies;-using bio-reducers in ore reduction: the issue of this action is the ability to access sustainably managed bio- reducers compatible with the constraints of our processes ;-replacing heavy fuel oil by gas for the production of electricity-the establishment of renewable electricity purchases and production coupled with the electrification of mines: at the same time as developing technical solutions, the successful implementation of this lever is based on a radical change of culture which requires long-term support;-developing the pre reduction of hydrogen ore alongside bio-reducers.Moreover, three decarbonation scenarios have been built:- absolute potential => all levers have been put at their maximum level of activation without considering any other constraints- technical potential => all levers have been put at their maximum level of activation while taking into account what is technically feasible- actionable potential => all levers have been put at their maximum level of activation while taking into account both technical and economic constraints. this is this later scenario that has been used to build the decarbonation roadmapThis robust roadmap to reduce the carbon footprint of Eramet's activities includes the percentage of activation of the different emissions reduction levers, a timeline (2025, 2030, 2035) and the impact and activation of the levers are at the granularity of the site to be easily actionable and precise.The efforts to reduce the carbon footprint of Eramet will not be the same for each business unit: Eramet will mainly focus on the processes that emit the bulk of Eramet emissions (manganese alloy and nickel alloy).This roadmap has been included in a specific chapter of the annual strategy plan of Eramet.. The SBT roadmap is therefore at the core of Eramet's strategy."
"GGC has set annual target in 2020 at 85,488 by using 2019 as the base year. The target and GHG emission scope 1 + 2 reporting covered mainly GGC own operation which is facility based including ME1, ME2 operational plant, warehouses and the headquarter."
"Litens had set a target to reduce absolute emissions from its Canadian manufacturing operations by 6% by 2020, considering 2014 as the baseline emissions.  Litens has already achieved that target and has established a new target for our global manufacturing operations."
We re-set our SBT in 2018 to account for acquisitions as well as to align with a 1.5-degree scenario.
"In order to align with the latest Net Zero foundations paper published by the SBTi, Telefónica increased the ambition of its Scope 3 target by a) including all Scope 3 emissions into the target; and b) increasing its ambition to ensure the targeted reduction aligned with the 1.5C pathway.To achieve this target, Telefónica is firmly committed to an open, collaborative relationship with its suppliers. Our commitment to them is based on establishing relations that enable us to jointly have a positive impact on our surroundings, through close collaboration and the sharing of good practices, fostered thanks to different initiatives with our suppliers, as the participation in ECOVADIS or JAC (Joint Audit Cooperation). In this sense, we work on the management of emissions in the supply chain, both globally and at a local level. In 2020, we created a new sector-based working group as part of the Joint Audit Cooperation (JAC) initiative, in order, as a telecommunications sector, to drive climate action in our supply chain. We assessed the climate-related maturity of the strategic suppliers of the 17 companies who are part of the conglomerate and began working along several different lines in order to increase their level of ambition, as well as providing training in collaboration with CDP and GSMA for the major Chinese companies.Globally, in 2020 we continued our supplier engagement programme about climate change with our key suppliers. we gathered information from our suppliers to understand the maturity level of their climate strategies and help them set more ambitious emission reduction targets, to inspire them to take action and offered them a best practices forum to foster innovation and exchange of practices. The suppliers included in this programme represent 66% of the emissions from our supply chain and 37% of our total Scope 3 emissions. In order to optimise the supplier assessment process, in 2020 we joined the CDP Supply Chain programme. Another significant action in 2020 related to our commitment to working with the supply chain was to join the ""1.5 ºC Supply Chain Leaders"" initiative, which advocates reducing the emissions of the small and medium enterprises that are part of our value chain. This programme enables us to reinforce our role in the value chain and accelerate the decarbonisation of the global economy."
"Anglo American Platinum aligns with the Anglo American 2020 energy and carbon targets, and sustainability strategy 2030 climate-change stretch goals. Our 2020 target of 10% absolute reduction in emissions was not fully met despite a reduction in emissions. This target is set at a company wide level.We are on track to achieve our 2030 targets. Continued work on operational productivity and energy efficiency sustained our steady decline in levels of GHG emissions generated and energy consumption."
"In 2021, we'll set our target year to achieve net zero carbon in accordance with SBTi.  We'll use 2019 as our baseline year and commit to a much more aggressive schedule than the 2050 timeline set by the Paris Agreement. In 2020,  we conducted greenhouse gas (GHG) inventory validation work, including the in-depth Scope 3 baseline assessment, which will inform our future net zero efforts across our value chain. We also began structuring our cross-functional efforts internally to ensure our business is aligned for the long-term success of our net zero efforts."
"We are defining our KPIs and targets internally. We have set the goal to reduce the emissions of all of our ISO 50001 sites by 2% yearly (2017 being the baseline). Until now, we have complied with our targets. ISO 50001 sites are: Veghel (The Netherlands); Birmingham (UK); London (UK) , Siegen (Germany) and Monchengladbach (Germany)."

"In 2016, Bloomberg committed to RE100 to source 100% of Bloomberg's electricity (Scope 2 market-based calculation) from renewable sources by 2025. Achieving this target will result in a 100% reduction in Scope 2 emissions (market-based) vs. 2010 Scope 2 market-based baseline.  At end 2020, Bloomberg had sourced 49.8% of its electricity from renewable sources and had achieved a 47.2% reduction in Scope 2 market-based emissions vs. 2010 baseline emissions."
The target covers 100% GHG emission from fuel consumption in scope 1 and electricity and district heating consumption in scope 2 including as well GHG emission related to use of hybrid cars and hybrid plug-in electric cars. Note: base year emission was adjusted from 7 613 tCO2e in 2015 to 7007.3 tCO2e.
"In 2014, Korean government established a roadmap to achieve the national GHG reduction and by 2015, the government implemented the emission trading system, and submitted Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDC); 37% reduction from expected emissions in 2015 and in 2030. NHIS also targets to reduce GHG emission by 37% from expected emissions in 2015 and in 2030, which is the same as the Korean government target."
Since June 2020 we are part of the RE100 initiative to show our commitment  to reduce CO2 emissions from our own operations. This target is equal to our committed target in RE100. In November 2020 our environmental targets (climate targets) have been assessed and approved (1.5°C) by the Science Based Targets initiative.
"This Absolute Target measures emissions from TCAP - NMSC (Gaia).We assume that this target contains 95% of the emissions of scope 1 and 2, since there are some diffuse emissions that we can not account for.Toyota Caetano Portugal (TCAP) decided to set the base year at 2016, considering that until this year, the business was not in its normal conditions. It was from 2016 that both the production of the LC70 as well as Toyota and Lexus sales reached a level of stability. In addition, it was the year in which TCAP began to have external validation of the data introduced in the CDP, giving more confidence to the information reported.This year we achieved a reduction in global emissions, perhaps due, in large part, to the COVID-19 pandemic, which caused a reduction in TCAP's activity."
"This new target intends to renovate the ambition of ASTM to define a decarbonization strategy in line with the requirements of the Science-Based Target initiative. The target covers 100% of Group-wide Scope 1+2 emissions for the base year 2020. Through a quantitative tool implemented with the support of an expert, ASTM defined a target in line with the SBTi Well Below 2° Scenario. In absolute terms the target is to reduce Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 25% by 2030 from the base year (2020). This target trajectory is also consistent with the intermediate reduction milestone for 2025 (-13% absolute Scope 1+2 emissions) defined by ASTM as one of its strategic ESG goals. In particular, ASTM signed a long-term ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) Loan Contract (due date 2026) of € 100 million with Mediobanca linked to the achievement of environmental KPIs such as CO2 emissions into the atmosphere (Scope 1+2) and the use of electricity from renewable sources. ASTM is committed to submit for approval this science-based target to SBTi in the next two years."
"This new target has been set in order to include the new plants that have been built between 2016 and 2018, covering in this way the 100% of Brembo's manufacturing plants.The amount reported in ""Covered emissions in base year"" has been updated by re-calculating it with more updated emission factors.This target was replaced by Abs 6."
"This target covers corporate financing for sectors excluding electricity generation, steel, cement, aluminum, paper and pulp. We have intensity target for electricity generation, steel, cement, aluminum, paper and pulp sectors. The science-based  target was submitted to SBTi on 2 July 2021. As of July 27, we have passed initial screening."
"In 2020 Leonardo set a new longer-termed target with a higher level of ambition. Leonardo's ambition is to reduce the Group's Scope 1 and Scope 2 (market-based) emissions by 40% in absolute terms. In 2020 Leonardo decided to replace the target Abs 1 with Abs 2, to have an emission reduction Scope 1 + Scope 2 of -40% by 2030. This change allows Leonardo to be in line with the criteria of Science-Based Targets initiative, covering a 10-year timeframe and an ambitious reduction towards decarbonisation.The increase of CO2 emissions in 2020 compared to 2019 is mainly due to greater use of gaseous substances (SF6) with high GWP during the manufacturing phase in the helicopters sector, that cannot be replaced so far due to technological constraints. However, Leonardo is carrying out study and plant modifications to implement a solution that will allow a significant reduction of CO2e emissions (estimated in about 165,000 met. ton.CO2e/year) and is implementing efficiency initiatives to support its decarbonisation strategy in line with the 40% reduction target."
"TotalEnergies shares the ambition to get to Net Zero emissions by 2050, together with society with an objective of net zero across TotalEnergies' worldwide operations by 2050 or sooner for scope 1 and 2 (Net Emissions). The calculation of net emissions takes into account natural carbon sinks like forest, regenerative agriculture and wetlands."
We aim to decrease emissions from our value chain (scope 3) by 40% per unit sold. Both targets use 2018 as a baseline and have been approved by the Science Based Targets initiative.
"We have made the commitment to be carbon neutral by 2035 for Scope 1 and 2 emissions across our entire global operations. To meet our goals, we are focused on: 1) Sourcing renewable and clean energy - We will shift to more zero carbon, renewable electricity by partnering with local utilities and investing in new renewable energy through power purchase agreements and securing renewable energy credits. 2) Improving our energy efficiency - Across our buildings, network, vehicle fleets, production studios, and theme parks, we will continue to develop and implement projects to improve energy efficiency. Combined with purchasing carbon offsets to address emissions that have not yet been mitigated, these efforts will help us further reduce our carbon footprint. 3) Measuring and reporting on our Scope 1 and 2 emissions annually - To provide transparency and help drive improvement, we have reported data for 2019 and 2020 using the GHG Protocol in alignment with the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) framework. We have partnered with a leading consulting firm to guide us through this and help develop our reporting and estimation approach to make sure we get it right. We realize this public commitment is the first step and we will continue to share our approach and progress as we work towards our goals."
"Scope 1 and Scope 2 (market-based) targets were tested by SBTi and found compatible with the Paris Agreement. We are awaiting release of the SBTi guidance for financial services including Scope 3 emissions, before obtaining formal verification from SBTi. Suncorp's emissions reduction and net zero targets are company-wide. Due to the vastly different nature and emissions profiles of corporate and industrial arms of Suncorp's business, two targets were developed and are tracked separately – one target for core business (corporate services/operations which includes day-to-day business and administrative functions, comprising more than 99% of Suncorp revenue), and one for industrial activities (automotive repair and automotive parts recycling operations via Suncorp Insurance Ventures). This enables clarity of boundaries, action and comparability with like financial services organisations. At the time of target setting, the Suncorp Insurance Ventures business was being considered for sale, further necessitating separate targets to be developed. Suncorp Insurance Ventures was subsequently sold to a third party in October 2019. Targets and emissions have been included in this year's CDP as audited emissions from Suncorp Insurance Ventures are captured by the timeframe of this year's CDP submission.Abs 1 is Suncorp's absolute target for 2030 for corporate operations. Abs 2 is Suncorp's absolute target for 2030 for Suncorp Insurance Ventures' industrial activities. Abs 3 is Suncorp's net zero target for 2050 for Suncorp's corporate operations. Abs 4 is Suncorp's net zero target for 2050 for Suncorp Insurance Ventures' industrial activities. Due to divestment of Suncorp Insurance Ventures in October 2019, Suncorp will no longer track Abs 2 and Abs 4.Note: Suncorp started measuring Scope 2 market-based emissions in FY2021 and will start reporting market-based emissions in the next CDP questionnaire."
"This is part of our validated SBT target to reduce absolute Scope 1, 2 & 3 emissions by 50.4% by 2030 from a 2019 baseline.  This target covers energy consumed in downstream leased assets across our offices where we sub-let space. Note - the impact of COVID-19 has seen a significant reduction in emissions across our full value chain. As offices begin to reopen and operations get back to 'normal' we are likely to see an increase in some emissions when compared to the previous 12 months.  Consequently, the target status is marked as 'Underway' even where we have achieved the targeted reduction of 50.4%."
"This data includes fuel usage by our Reinstatement contractors, fuel for LNG tanker deliveries and use of helicopters to undertake surveys of the network.The scope of this target is currently limited by OFGEMs definition of 'contractor' to include mains replacement and reinstatement works and helicopter surveys. This also includes LNG tanker transport. No other types of contractor vehicle are included in here though we are currently undertaking a Scope 3 analysis with The Carbon Trust to find out where the gaps are and what other information we should be gathering.  We expect to set a Scope 3 Science based target in the next couple of years.

"As part of the overhaul of our data collection system and taking into account our new subsidiary (MEDIA 6 IMG), we followed the methodologies described in the GHG PROTOCOL (https://ghgprotocol.org/sites/default/files/standards/ghg-protocol-revised.pdf), concerning ""Base year emissions recalculation for an acquisition"" and ""Recalculations for changes in calculation methodology or improvements in data accuracy"", to recalculate the base year (base year 2017), which results in an increase in scopes 1, 2 & 3 by 20%. For the year 2019-2020 the waste emits 251 TCO2e and the objective is to reduce the weight of this transmitter station by 4%, approximately 10 TCO2e for the year 2020-2021 and to reduce to 50 TCO2e by 2030. for this it is a question of taking again 80% of the plastic falls in the processes of injection of MEDIA6 Production PLV. Improving the optimization of metal plate cut-outs at Media6 Production Metal to achieve a ratio of 70% and a reduction in the supply of packaging items by reusing cardboard scrap ."
"This is our Scope 3 from Upstream transportation and distribution from our operation Bancolombia Group. The achievement of the target is due to the pandemic, we expect a normalization in 2021, for this reason the achievement of the target is considered in underway"
"The signing of the Fashion Pact in August 2019 further enhanced the commitment taken on by the Group to reduce its environmental impact in terms of climate change. The reduction and offsetting of CO2 emissions is thus one of the priorities established by the Group in its Sustainability Plan. The Group has implemented a Science-Based Targets (SBTs) in line with limiting global warming to 1.5°C. This target is covering scope 1, scope 2 market-based emissions. The Salvatore Ferragamo Group commits to reduce scope 1, scope 2 market-based by 42% by 2029 from a 2019 base-year."
"The targets ABS1 et ABS2 have been replaced by ABS3, ABS4 and ABS5.As mentioned in the section 2.2a and 2.3a, DIAM is facing emerging regulation potentially taking the form of a carbon tax. As mentioned in the section 2.2a and 2.3a, DIAM is also facing a market risk taking the form of a switch towards low carbon products and maybe a decrease of POS purchases. To answer these risks and to create opportunities for the group, DIAM chose to engage in Science Based Targets in order to reduce its carbon emissions in line with science.DIAM has submitted its new targets to SBTi at the end of 2020, after CDP 2020 reporting.This target (ABS4) has been approved by SBTi in Jan 2021.It covers 100% of scope 3 Purchased goods and services, which represented 32% of emissions in the base year (2019).To help the achievement of the 46% reduction target on the Purchased Goods and Services (Scope 3), DIAM has set internal targets including for instance to achieve at least 80% of recycled plastic usage in products by 2030 (target described in more detail in section 4.2a)."
"Compared to 2015, Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions will be reduced by 37.5% in 2030."
"In 2018, we set a science-based target (which was approved by the Science-Based Targets Initiative in 2019) to reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 50% by 2030 from a 2017 base year. Our base year data includes emissions from UBM Plc which was acquired by Informa in June 2018. UBM Plc previously had a separate science-based target which we included in our 2019 submission to CDP and which was superseded by this one.Our target along with our scope 3 target (see below) is consistent with reductions required to keep global warming to well below 2C. This year, we updated our target reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 55% by 2030 from a 2017 base year. The updated target is consistent with reductions required to keep global warming to below 1.5C.Our scope 1&2 target has been achieved ahead of schedule thanks to significant reductions in our office estate, investments in energy efficiency, self generation and the purchase of energy attribute certificates for 97% of our offices in 2020. This resulted in a significant reduction of our market-based emissions."
"This year we have had our targets approved by the SBTi.  This target demonstrates that we are committed to reducing the whole company's Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 50% by the year 2030. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic forcing our offices to close and sites to be consolidated, this has significantly reduced  our current scope 1 and 2 footprint and given us a good platform to achieve this target. To help guard against emissions returning to a pre-pandemic level, we have worked with colleagues across the globe to identify carbon reduction, energy efficiency and renewable energy opportunities. To date, over 40 projects have been identified. Throughout FY22 we will continue to work towards implementing these projects to drive progress towards our 2030 commitment."
This target is for our UK business. They have a goal to become carbon neutral by 2025
"It was targeted at the energy usage of Vietnam, China, and Korea warriors (electricity, steam, LNG, diesel, bunker oil, LPG, anthracite, gasoline)."
"This is a company-wide target, relating to all locations and activities and commit us to reduce scope 1 & 2 (market-based) emissions by 25% from a 2018 base year. The targets covering GHG emissions from company operations (scopes 1 & 2) are consistent with reductions required to keep warming to 1.5 Degrees Celsius.  This commits us to a linear reduction in emissions over the period 2018-2030"
"The estimated emissions just for the Cocoa Plant + Chocolate Factory were approx.6,707.2ton CO2-e, which represent more than 98% of the total emissions of thecompany. If the output of the cocoa plant and chocolate factory was around 29,210.7ton (including cocoa liquor, cocoa butter, cocoa cake and compound chocolate ), theKPI CO2-e for the cocoa plant is approx. 0.23 ton of CO2-e /MT output"
"The absolute reduction target in the medium term is primarily an energy efficiency target which has been translated into tons of CO2. In fiscal year 2013 we launched our Group wide Sustainability Strategy, which aims to reduce CO2 emissions by 100,000 t CO2 by 2022/2023 (updated in 2018 in line with the Vision 2025). The program is being implemented through concrete projects at individual sites."
"We care the environment and put effort to reduce our environmental footprint. Inline with our vision; we aim to reduce our GHG emissions by our efforts driven on energy and emission efficiency, emission reduction activities and raising the awareness by training, communication activities. By doing so, we aim to reduce our Scope 1 emissions by 4%.  Our Scope 1 emissions arises from combustion of fossil fuels for heating, generators, company cars and leakages from refrigerants and fire extinguishers. As a result, we overachieved our target by more than 4 times.The mainreason is our emission and energy reduction projects and measures, and also pandemic."
"Development of the Peshkabir field in the Tawke license in the Kurdistan region of Iraq commenced in 2017. As is typical in the region gas was planned to be flared. However, the oil produced at Peshkabir had higher than expected associated gas content. Consequently, the Tawke license became by far the largest contributor to DNO's GHG emissions, (598,222 tonnes CO2e in 2019). For this reason, in 2019 a target was set for the emissions at Tawke license to be reduced by at least two-third (66.67%) within five years (by 2024). The target was set for this facility (the Tawke license) as it is the largest source of DNO's scope emissions (598,222/632,512=95%).The reduction of emissions was to be achieved through a two-phase gas injection project (instead of flaring). The first phase of the project (commissioned in mid 2020) involved capturing and processing associated gas produced at the Peshkabir field and pipelining it to the nearby Tawke field (within the same license). At the Tawke filed, the transported gas is injected underground for reservoir pressure management. The cost of this project was USD 110 million. By end of 2020, DNO captured, pipelined and reinjected a total of 2.4 billion cubic feet (bcf) of Peshkabir field associated gas - which otherwise would have been flared - into the Tawke field for pressure maintenance (in addition to another 0.3 bcf reinjected at the Peshkabir field itself). Phase 2 of the project will capture and reinject into the Tawke field any associated gas produced at the Tawke filed. This project is in the final stages of review before contract award and it is expected to finish in 2022-2023 at cost of USD 30 million. This project will materially reduce flaring of associated gas at the Tawke field and help with reservoir pressure maintenance and oil recovery.Once Phase 1&2 are commissioned, flaring emissions in the Tawke license will drop significantly. Although uncertain (depending on reservoir performance), we forecast in 2024, on an average, 21 MMscf (million standard cubic feet) per day of otherwise flared associated gas will be injected. This compares to 22.1 MMscf per day of associated gas flaring in 2019.Although uncertain, we forecast total GHG emissions of Tawke license (containing both Tawke and Peshkabir field) on a Scope 1 basis to be around 211,000 tCO2e in 2024  compared to 598,222 tCO2e (reduction of 65%)."

"Doosan Heavy Industries & Construction has achieved its carbon emission targets, but continuous reductions are under way."
"As per stage one of the three-stage process, outlined in the Company's Climate strategy, the planned and ongoing projects to modernise production facilities of our enterprises, the Company plans to reduce its own CO2-equivalent emissions by 6% and its indirect non-energy related GHG emissions by 25% by 2025, compared with total emissions in 2019. In 15 years' time, emissions are to be reduced by 77%. A key aspect in achieving this target is the introduction of green hydrogen technologies in the metallisation process. A major contribution will be made by switching from blast-furnace production to metallisation and electric arc furnace production, as well as by using renewable and low-carbon energy.The Company's Climate strategy, GHG emissions and its targets were verified by the British Standards Institute (‘BSI')"
"We have a year over year target to reduce emissions by 1%.  We went from a scope 1 &2 emissions in 2019 of 31,141 to 31,652 in 2020.  A slight overall increase in emissions.  Similar to past years, we have continued to acquire companies that we did not previously have in the prior reporting year.  Even when we normalize, practices for reducing carbon footprint have not yet been adopted by all of these locations.  As we on board new companies, it does take some time for them to adopt our policies and begin working towards our sustainability goals.   Our challenge continues to be  the ongoing addition of companies and real estate to the portfolio as we implement strategies to reduce scope 1 and 2 emissions."
"The Bank's target is on Scope 1 and 2 Global emissions. The base year reflects the Bank's 2016 fiscal year end (November 1, 2015 - October 31, 2016).  In fiscal 2019, the Bank surpassed its initial target of 10% decrease in Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 2021. In 2019, the Bank set a new target of reducing its global absolute Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 25% by 2025."
"Our organizational boundary had been changing last year due to the new production base expand in Taiwan, Tainan city. Therefore,  Wiwynn Corporation resets the base year as 2020  according to ISO 14064:2018 part 1, clause 6.4.2 Review of base-year GHG inventory. We also estimate the electricity consumption and green power usage base on the global operation capacity by 2030. In other words, our organization boundaries would constantly extend and changed in the next five years. And we consider stabilizing the emissions of the target (Abs1) at our base year level to collect the benchmark data year by year for participating in SBTi."
"This target is a continuation of Abs 2, with a long-term timeframe to maintain operational emissions at zero beyond 2030. This means any changes in operations following 2030 will need to be aligned with zero operational emissions."
"This short-term target was created in 2021 and was developed in line with the SBTi's 1.5DS methodology. It has been internally approved by our board. This target will be submitted to the SBTi for approval in the near future and we expect it to be approved. The majority of HomeServe's scope 1 & 2 footprint arises from vehicle fuel (~ 82%), with the remaining contributors being natural gas (~ 8%) and electricity (~10%). Our target is modelled on an absolute contraction approach consistent with the SBTi methodology."
The target is focused on the purchase of renewable energy in all our operations in order to achieve zero emissions in scope 2 in the following years.
"Bus Átha Cliath Gross Emissions reduction target (Scope 1 & 2)-As a public sector, state sponsored body, CIÉ's operating companies have climate targets stemming from Ireland's national emissions targets, which are subject to EU regulation as a member state. Previously Ireland's public sector 2020 targets (as a result of the EU Effort Sharing Decision) included:  A 20% reduction of non-ETS sector emissions on 2005 levels.Bus Átha Cliath have achieved a reduction of 42.4% in total Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions since a base year of 2008. These reductions have been achieved through:- The delivery of a fleet replacement programme, in partnership with the NTA, leading to over 50% of the fleet being upgraded to meet the Euro VI engine emission standard; the highest standard possible in terms of emissions. Euro VI technologies reduce the level of harmful exhaust emissions using diesel particulate filters (DPF) and exhaust gas recirculation (EGR).- The selective catalyst reduction (SCR) system Ad-Blue has also been added to further reduce emissions.- Effective route optimisation has been implemented for operational efficiency.- Implementation of eco-driving training, which has yielded a 13% reduction in fuel use since 2008, equating to 4.2 million litres of diesel.- The introduction of a fuel management system to capture buses using excessive fuel.- The introduction of plug in hybrids due to total 74 in number by 2020/2021. These are expected to reduce bus related greenhouse gas emissions by up to 30%."
"The target covers all GHG emissions of all assets and operations under scope 1 and 2 such as refrigerants, stationary combustion, mobile combustion, electricity and district heating."
We are revising the absolute 1 target to make it more ambitious. The absolute contraction methodology has been used for scopes 1 and 2. The minimum required for the 1.5° scenario is -42% over 10 years. We decided to go further than the 1.5° scenario because switching to 100% renewable energy allows us to reduce emissions by 90%. We are waiting for the SBTi formal approval before replacing the absolute 1 by the absolute 2.
Establish evidence-based targets for suppliers or subcontractors that account for 30% of Scope 3's Cat1 (purchases from our suppliers and outsourcing of production).
"This target applies to production facilities and warehouses which covered 98.6% of Thule Group total Scope 1 and 2 emissions in the base year (2014).  In 2020, greenhouse gas emissions from our facilities decreased by 76%  compared with our 2014 base year (base year emissions exclude site divested in 2018). We have achieved our greenhouse gas emission target for 2020. Our target can be summarized as : Direct and indirect emissions of greenhouse gases are to decline 65% in relative produced quantities at our production facilities by the end of 2020, compared to the base year of 2014.We are driving emissions reductions within our own production facilities mainly by increasing the production efficiency (investing in new efficient technology and automated technology), using/completing final transitions to LED lights which are motion or light-sensing, using/planning future solar panel installations, finalizing transition to electric forklift trucks, and increasing the use of renewable energy and certified renewable electricity.In the autumn of 2020, the Board and management of Thule Group decided to commit to the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) – a global standard for climate targets stemming from the goal of the Paris Agreement to prevent the earth's average temperature rising by more than 1.5° C. Thule Group's new 2030 science-based targets cover scope 1, 2, and 3 greenhouse emissions. Read more about our new targets here: https://www.thulegroup.com/en/long-term-targets Read more details about our new targets in our 2020 Annual Report: https://www.thulegroup.com/sites/default/files/pr/20210331-02e61dc1-8530-4c24-9e87-978ab6a4d989-1.pdf"
"This goal is an absolute goal, ie the emissions from all the company's trips will be zero by 2023."
"Britvic's financial year runs from October to September - all targets and data refer to these periods, i.e. 2020 refers to October 2019 - September 2020In 2019  we were proud to commit to setting a science-based emissions reduction target to ensure that our carbon strategy reflected  the ambition and urgency required to keep global temperature rise to within 1.5°C. We have targeted an overall absolute reduction of 36% vs 2017 by 2025.  This involves us reducing our scope 1 & 2 emissions by 50% and our scope 3 emissions by 35%. We also pledged to become net zero carbon by 2050.To set this target, we completed a full value chain analysis including engaging with over 300 suppliers to understand their current carbon impact and programmes in place to reduce it. This baseline data set has enabled us to identify hotspot areas and develop projects that will have the biggest impact on reducing our indirect emissions footprint. Going forward, this information will aid us to better measure and understand the climate change risk in our key supply chains, as we step towards incorporating the recommendations of the Taskforce on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures. The target coverage includes all scope 1 & 2 emissions and over 90% of over scope 3 emissions. The  second year of scope 3 emissions inventory analysis is currently being carried out with completion expected by middle of  2021 . The scope 3 emissions reported in FY20  is 730,108 tonnes of CO2e and reflects a combination of 2017 baseline  carbon data and the latest data for categories that we were able to update since setting our SBTs  in 2019."
"We have more target and objectives for the Hamilton Plants. this section covers emissions only, we have targets set for the following1. Hazardous Waste Generation  reduce 30%2. VOC Reduction by    25%3. Recycled Cardboard   100%4. Recycled Metals    100%5. Fuel Blend Hazardous Waste   (100%)6. Land Field Use    30% 7. CO2 Reduction  20% GLOBE"
"Absolute Carbon emissions, (market-based), have been reduced by 50.1%, since the base year of 2007, versus a 50% target to be achieved by 2020. This equates to delivery of 100.2% of the target in 100% of the lapsed time. Our 2030 commitments and targets to accelerate to a low carbon world; i.e. become Net Zero carbon in our direct operations (scope 1 & 2) and reduce our value chain (scope 3) emissions by 50% summarizes our emissions reduction targets & goals for the next decade."
"Our SBT has been validated by the SBTi. The SBT is included in our Environment Plan 2030. The time frame is aligned with Science Based Targets criteria. Although our SBT was validated in 2019, we set the target as the group in 2018."
"We have a commitment to remain carbon neutral (i.e. net zero carbon emissions) from 2015 onward. This carbon neutrality commitment includes all global facilities within our operational control (i.e. offices, data centers) and business travel emissions within our supply chain. To achieve this commitment, we follow our Carbon Reduction Framework, which includes ambitious targets to implement energy efficiency and procure renewable energy at our facilities. The energy efficiency (10% absolute energy reduction from 2013 to 2020) and renewable energy (100% renewable electricity by 2020) targets are further detailed in C4.2 of this CDP response. Recognizing that these activities alone will not achieve net zero carbon emissions, we invest in certified carbon offsets to achieve the carbon neutrality commitment. It is instructive to note that the 2019 base year emissions provided for Abs1 are the gross market-based emissions (before offsets) within the defined target boundary and consequently the certified offsets purchased are equivalent to these gross emissions. To maximize our transparency to CDP stakeholders, we have reported Abs1 with the understanding that CDP guidance requests that carbon offsets are not reported in C4.1. We have taken this approach as we believe it is an important component of disclosing our progress. Furthermore, we are confident that our reporting of Abs2, Abs3, and energy and renewable energy targets in C4.2 provides CDP with targets that satisfy the reporting guidance as they do not include carbon offsets.We have achieved our carbon neutrality commitment in 2019 through a combination of energy efficient operations and the purchase of renewable electricity and the purchase of carbon offsets."
"This is our Scope 3 target from purchased goods and services from our operation Bancolombia Group. The achievement of the target is due to the pandemic, we expect a normalization in 2021, for this reason the achievement of the target is considered in underway"
Reduce company owned and leased car emission 30% by F2025 (baseline F2019).
"(1). The coverage of this target is 100% within Acer's operation boundary.(2). The gross emissions of the base year 2009 was 32,144 ton CO2e and 12,199 ton CO2e of the reporting year 2020.(3). The target is 80% reduction in 2020 to meet 6,428 ton CO2e emissions.(4). % of target achieved = (32144 - 12199)*100%/(32144-6428) = 77.6%(5) % of time = (2020 - 2009)/(2050 - 2009) = 26.8%"
"The Home Depot has reduced our absolute Scope 1 + Scope 2 (location-based) emissions by 41%, exceeding our goal of a 20% reduction from 2010 to 2020. The main driver behind the progress on this target is our goal to reduce U.S. store purchased electricity 20% by 2020, which we have surpassed, achieving a 44%  reduction in U.S. store purchased electricity from a 2010 baseline."
"Based on Japan's greenhouse gas reduction target under the Paris Agreement (46% reduction from FY 2013 levels by 2030), our company has set a CO2 emissions target for FY 2030 for all sites in Japan of 50,000 tons (50% reduction from FY 2013 levels). This is a target for an annual reduction rate of 4.2% from FY 2020 to FY 2030."
"In order to reduce our emissions from Essentra's operations, in August 2020 sustainability targets were set that were approved by the BSC. This was communicated widely both internally and externally. It demonstrates the commitment to our sustainability strategy, especially linked to the Energy & Climate Change pillar and highlights the medium to long-term commitment towards a low-carbon business model.  This target is focused on all global operations including manufacturing. warehouses and offices across Essentra up to what constitutes 99% of Essentra's electricity consumption within operational control. Target: Commitment to reduce Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions and become carbon neutral by 2040 compared to the 2019 figures (both absolute and normalised with £ million revenue). For future reporting, we will report the progress against this goal that has been set in the annual reporting of accounts. Strategy: This target will be achieved through a programme of renewable energy projects (largely solar PV), energy efficiency improvements and emission reductions across the entire portfolio. Site level actions will include the introduction of efficient LED lighting, site insulation, clean energy pilots and energy audits to identify further opportunities. Additionally, there will be a focus on procurement of renewable energy across the portfolio. We have the ambition to run carbon neutral operations by 2040, if not before."
"In early 2021, Aegon UK publicly committed to achieving net zero carbon emissions in their default solutions by 2050 with the aim of exploring the feasibility of reducing them by half by 2030. As a workplace pension provider, Aegon UK is seeking to take a more active position in addressing climate change while supporting the UK Government's own 2050 net zero ambition."
The NISSIN FOODS Group has set a goal of reducing greenhouse gas (SCOPE1 + 2) from business activities by 30% by 2030 compared to 2018 in its EARTH FOOD CHALLENGE 2030 and Mid- to Long-term Growth Strategy. The Scope 1+2 reduction targets stated here have been certified by the Science Based Targets (SBT) initiative as science-based targets aligned with the Paris Agreement that seek to limit the average rise in global temperatures to well-below 2°C above pre-industrial levels. The range of scope includes domestic and overseas Group companies at the baseline year. Domestic and overseas Group companies added to the group from the baseline year onward are excluded but will be included when reviewing 2024 SBT targets.
"The reduction in energy consumption, at year 2024, will be reached thanks to several targets to be met: within water sector, environment sector, and electricity distribution sector. All sectors in fact have specific targets. In particular. Areti,(the Company that distributes electricity): as previous years, various interventions have been carried out in 2020 and are expected before year 2024: i) reduction of physical losses in the distribution network due to change in HV (from 60 kV to 150 kV), MV (from 8.4 kV to 20 kV), LV (from 231 V to 400 V); ii) new transformer installation - MV/LV transformers with very low losses; variation in the MV network configuration.  In various Group other also efficiency measures will be carried out.  Moreover, the reduction of Scope 2 emissions include installation of LED lighting systems of the Rome public lighting grid. Moreover, the Water company Acea Ato 2's Energy Efficiency Plan has a target of 12 GWh to 2024 considering water pumping system and other measures within the Integrated Water System. This target will be achieved through several activities of water leakage research and pressure management. Also Acea Ato 5 and AdF have planned efficiency measures. During 2020 some of these activities have been already completed.Moreover, Acea will try to formalize a Group SBT by engaging the companies for which this is feasible. Alternatively, it will in any case formalize a Group Target."
"We continue to advance in our strategy to reach an economy that is climate-neutral, efficient in the use of resources and competitive. In August 2020, the SBTi approved our science-based decarbonisation targets. Inditex commits to reducing absolute Scope 3 GHG emissions (in the Purchased Goods and Services category) by 20% by 2030 from a 2018 base year. This target exceeds the minimum ambition defined by the absolute contraction approach and is therefore also considered ambitious by the SBTi.With a view to greater transparency, the Purchased goods and services category (according to the GHG Protocol) is subdivided into the following categories: raw materials extraction, raw material processing, material production, wet processes and finished product assembly."
"In 2020, after achieving our net zero carbon target five year ahead of schedule, we committed to the Science-based Targets Initiative and set a target using the streamlined small and medium size enterprise (SME) approach. We selected the more ambitious of two target options -- consistent with reductions required to keep warming to 1.5°C --  and committed to reduce absolute, location-based scope 1 and scope 2 GHG emissions (so excluding RECs and offsets) 50% by 2030 from a 2018 base year, and to measure and reduce our scope 3 emissions. This targets covers 100% of Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions from our in-service office and studio portfolio, and we are committing to measuring and reducing our scope 3 emissions with a particular focus on embodied carbon in our developments and major repositioning projects.Note: In accordance with SBTi and GHG protocol guidance, we re-calculated our 2018 baseline to account for material changes to our portfolio (and resulting emissions), including acquisitions, dispositions, and completed developments that became in-service after the 2018 baseline year. While our absolute GHG emissions dropped significantly in the reporting year -- showing that we are 43% of the way towards achieving our target -- we attribute much of that to reduced physical occupancy in our buildings due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and we anticipate they will increase as tenants reintegrate into the office. Our long-term plan to achieve this target relies on a strategy of gradually reducing our location-based Scope 1 & 2 emissions through continued energy efficiency efforts/project implementation, on-site renewables, and direct procurement of clean power from our local utilities."
"Cellnex Telecom submitted an SBT target on May 2021, which was officially approved by the SBT initiative in June 2021.  This target is company-wide, in line with the 1.5C pathway and aims to reduce absolute Scope 1 & 2 & from fuel and energy related activities GHG emissions by 70% by 2030 from the base year 2020. This target covers 100% of our scope 1 and 2 emissions as well as 100% of category 3.3 emissions. Overall, it covers 70.31% of our total 2020 GHG emissions, and 25.75% of the total scope 3 emissions. In order to fit the reporting of this SBT target to the structure of this reporting table in C4.1a (column ''Scope(s) (or Scope 3 category)”) we have separated our SBT target in 2 targets (Abs 1 and Abs 2), corresponding to the target for scope 1+2 (Abs 1) and for category 3.3 (Abs2).In addition, we wanted to mention that we have carried out a scope 3 screening and we have seen that our scope 3 emissions represent less than 40% of our total carbon footprint, which means that we are not required to include our scope 3 in the SBT target. However, we still have decided voluntarily to include it. Specifically, we have included category 3.3 in this first SBT target submitted corresponding to our Abs1 target, but we have also included category 3.1 and 3.2 in our supplier SBT target that we have also submitted (see target Abs3 for more details).In order to achieve targets Abs1 and Abs2, our Department of Global Energy has launched the Energy Transition Plan based on the following four energy management mechanisms that include some specific actions to develop between 2021 and 2025:i) Principles of Energy 4.0 as intelligent measurement or digitization of processes and procedures related to energy.ii) Purchase of renewable energy (considering the different mechanisms available: energy purchase contracts (PPA), guarantees of origin, etc.).iii) Energy efficiency (offer the same service, but with a reduction in energy consumption).iv) Self-generation of renewable energy, especially by photovoltaic production in the same location to reduce the consumption of electricity from the grid.With all these measures, it is expected to reduce not only the GHG emissions associated with scope 2 (purchase of electricity), but also the reduction of fuels in stationary sources, refrigerant gas leaks and WTT and T&D emissions related to energy."
"This is the mid-term SBT for Scope 3, ending in 2030. The annual reduction is -5,6% from the base year 2018, with a total reduction from 2018-2030 of -50 %. Although the target has been achieved in the reporting year, the scope 3 emissions have been affected by the covid-19 pandemic (e.g., less business travel) and we expect these emissions to increase somewhat in 2021 and 2022. This is why the target status is still defined as underway. The four absolute targets set  (Abs 1,2,3,4) can be considered as a science based target since it meets the inclusion and ambition criterias from CDP as well as the 1,5 degree target criterias set by Science Based Target Initiative (SBTi).  The target is an absolute target, where 100 % of the emissions on scope 1 and 2 are covered, as well as relevant categories in Scope 3 (but Investments are excluded as there is no methodology on targetsetting for Investments yet)."
"i) In 2020 100%   electricity from 100% renewable Energy hab been bought.   ii) For 2021   we bought CO2 certificates to  cover 100%  of scope 1, 2 and 3.   Further improvements have been made by reducing Overall Energy consumption; more Projects are planned for 2021.   For example, we want to save energy by replacing existing lighting with highly efficient LED technology. Improvements to our extraction systems are also intended to reduce electricity consumption in the long term. We are also reducing our compressed air consumption on machines through continuous improvement. For example, in addition to implementing technical measures, the measuring point structure has been significantly intensified so that compressed air consumption can be better tracked and weak points can be identified and remedied more quickly. Our vehicle fleet was largely replaced by hybrid vehicles. The creation of a corresponding charging infrastructure will significantly reduce the use of fossil fuels."
"ABB launched this climate change target as part of its Sustainability Strategy 2030 in November 2020. The target has since been submitted and approved as a Science Based Target to the 1.5 degree C trajectory. ABB also committed to be carbon neutral in Scope 1+2 by 2020. After reducing as much as we can of our Scope 1+2 emissions through energy efficiency measures and other efforts in own operations (>80 percent), we will compensate for the remaining emissions through credible offsets when we approach 2030. This year, we have joined the Business Ambition for 1.5°C initiative and thus committed to achieve net-zero emissions across our value chain no later than 2050."
Our target is to reduce Scope 2 by using electricity from renewable sources and thereby reducing the emission factor
"In 2020, the Group began work on the development of science-based objectives for the emissions generated by its activities worldwide (Scope 1 and 2) and for the emissions of the broader value chain (Scope 3). Prysmian Group started to implement an ambitious climate strategy adopting science-based targets, in line with the requirements of the Paris Agreement, and endorsing the Business Ambition (1.5°C) with the ''net zero” target expected to be achieved between 2035 and 2040 with regard to the emissions generated by its operations (Scope 1 and 2) aligned to a 1.5° scenario and by 2050 for emissions generated by the value chain (Scope 3) aligned to a 2-Degree scenario. The defined reduction targets are now being submitted to the SBT initiative, so they are not approved yet.Covered emissions in reporting year have been assumed equal to the base year value, since the calculation model is now being consolidated and 2020 values are not available yet. However, due to pandemic emergency, it is expected that 2020 values are lower than 2019."

Our financial year is January to December 2020
"In 2017 we signed the UN Climate Neutral Pledge. In line with the Paris Agreement on climate change, and by signing the pledge, we commit to become climate neutral by 2050. As 2050 is a very long-term goal, we intend to achieve our target to become carbon neutral by 2030. Based on our objective of zero emissions by 2050,  and taking a linear approach, we have calculated that this long-term target needs a yearly reduction of 2.86% since the baseline year. Accordingly, in 2020 the targeted reduction from baseline year would be 14%, a percentage that we have significantly exceeded as hereby reported (52.63% of target achieved). Calculation of the yearly reduction:-Years to achieve the zero emissions 2050 – 2015 = 35-Percentage of emissions to reduce each year: 100/35 = 2.86%-Objective for 2020: (2020-2015) x 2.86% = 14%This target covers all Amadeus' Scope 1 and 2 emissions worldwide. In 2020 we have achieved a reduction of 52.63% CO2e in our combined Scope 1 & 2 from our baseline year thanks to energy efficiency measures and the implementation of 100% renewable energy at the Data Center through Guarantees of Origin (GOs) of renewable energy. Although this reduction is consistent with the continuous decrease of CO2e that we have been reporting last years, we are aware that it has been particularly remarkable in 2020 due to the partial or total closing of our offices as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic.More detailed information on our performance regarding emissions can be found at:http://www.amadeus.com/documents/corporate/corporate_responsibility/amadeus-operations-environmental-performance.pdf"
"The target covers the emissions of our non core operations (Mobility and Offices); this is scope 1 + scope 2 (grid losses excluded). Compared to last years, there is an overall decrease in the several categories (buildings and vehicles) related emissions. Although, it is important to take these data very carefully given the specific situation in reporting year 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the generalization of teleworking and subsequent decrease in the administrative buildings consumption and use of the vehicles to commute to the offices."
"Our Abs3 target is at least a 90% reduction in GHG emissions from our electric generation portfolio by 2030 (from 2005 levels).  In combination with our other absolute targets, 96% of our Scope 1 base year emissions are covered by our emission reduction targets."
"Novasez set an absolute GHG emission target for Scope 1+2 to maintain the global average temperature rise to 2??, much lower than the pre-industrial level, and limit the increase to 1.5??. A 10-year plan has been launched with a target of reducing emissions by 20% in 2020 (total target of 248,732 tCO2e). To achieve the final goal of 248,732 tCO2e, a total of 62,183 tCO2e must be reduced."
"We have updated our target to ensure they are aligned with the latest climate science and in line with the UK's commitment under the UN Paris Agreement, thereby contributing to the global effort to prevent the worst consequences of climate change. This target, although not approved by the Science Based Targets Initiative, is aligned with the reductions required to maintain global temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Please note that the % of target achieved appears minimal due to a restatement of the 2018 emissions which is not reflected in the 2018 baseline used for this target. The 2020 emissions total is therefore the most accurate figure and it will be used to set an official science-based target later this year which will also include Scope 3 emissions."
Our  emissions have increased compare to last year due to  various projects implemented  and also strengthening of inventory of emissions across sites and addition of new sites
"The target refers to all Scope 1 and 2 emissions deriving from Iren Group's activities. The reduction of 34% at 2035 will be possible through: zeroing scope 2 emissions purchasing energy 100% certified green and realizing of PV plants on plants and offices for self-consumption; zeroing emissions from the vehicle fleet using only ecovehicles; introducing new technologies to capture CO2; gradually introducing blending of hydrogen and other green gasses, replacing a part of natural gas in cogeneration, thermal and thermoelectric plants."
"The Bank's target was to reduce by 2% the overall electricity consumption in 2020, compared to 2019. For scope 2 market-based, which represents 79.5% from Scope 2 emissions in 2020, the reduction of 2% on electricity consumption would represent 0.699% overall decrease on the relative emissions (2019 = 24,766.56 tCO2e and 2020 expected = 24,593.51 tCO2e). The electricity consumption reduction from the private electricity supplier (market-based) was actually 5.11% (instead of 2%) and the relevant emissions target was achieved and trespassed, having a 551.7% reduction (23,811.88 tCO2e)."
"To maintain the momentum achieved by our expired goal, Humana set a new emissions reduction target in 2018.  By the end of 2022, Humana will achieve a 2.1% YOY decrease (cumulative 10.5%) in greenhouse gas emissions from 2017 baseline emissions across our portfolio of owned and leased properties under direct Humana control.  This goal utilizes the suggested annual reduction based on CDP's science-based target methodology.While we exceeded the 2.1 percent YOY reduction in both 2018, 2019, and 2020 we plan to keep this target in place through 2022 to improve on this progress."
"(1)In 2015, Quanta completed greenhouse gas emissioncertification, thus 2015 is designated as our base year. However, the ISO 14064-1:2018 revision was implemented in 2020, hence the GHG audit base year was changed to 2020.(2)Quanta established a company-wide inventory list of greenhouse gas emissions in accordance with the requirements of ISO 14064-1:2018 and the greenhouse gas level disclosure protocol. Each year, the Company will conduct the greenhouse gas emission inventory check and acquire the verification certification. In response to government policies, new energy conservation measures and goals are stipulated each year. A comprehensive greenhouse gas emission statistics calculation system is also being gradually established. The inspection covers the qualitative and quantitative check of category 1 (direct greenhouse gas emissions), category 2 (indirect greenhouse gas emissions). The calculated emissions do not include tradeoffs and transactions.GHG audit was not carried out at the Thailand plant, hence it was not included in the GHG emissions data."
"We care the environment and put effort to reduce our environmental footprint. Inline with our vision; we aim to reduce our GHG emissions by our efforts driven on energy and emission efficiency, emission reduction activities and raising the awareness by training, communication activities. Thanks to above mentioned activities, we aim to reduce our Scope 1+2 emissions by 4%.  Our Scope 1 emissions arises from combustion of fossil fuels for heating, generators, company cars and leakages from refrigerants and fire extinguishers. Band our Scope 2 emissions arises from the electricity energy purchased from the grid. As a result, we overachieved our target by more than 4 times.The mainreason is our emission and energy reduction projects and measures, and also pandemic."
"We started to carry out the target of emissions  reduction based on 2013. Our target of emissions reduction by 2020 is 11.3% We based on every year, year-on-year rolling target was used. Our production in 2019 is decreased by 12.3% from previous year.

"As part of the stainless steel industry sector, Acerinox is aligned with the Paris Agreement to limit global warming by undertaking ambitious efforts to combat climate change and adapt to its effects.  The Paris Agreement works on a 5- year cycle of increasingly ambitious climate action carried out by countries.  Accordingly, we have ratified our commitment to achieving carbon neutrality as a long term goal (2050) with intermediate steps such as 20% CO2 reduction by 2030.  Digital transformation, electrification o boost transport and industrial processes in an effort to reduce emissions, adopt alternative energies and increase efficiency and hydrogen support are the main channels through which Acerinox will descarbonise its value chain. Collaboration with the various social players will be key to overcoming possible difficulties in achieving this aim, such as the cost of CO2 and the new market's restrictions that Acerinox will widthstand, the price of renewable electrictricity and hydrogen's feasiblity. In 2020,  Acerinox  Europe signed 1,031,012 MWh of guaranteed origin of power installations from renweable sources for 10 years.  These emissions reported include VDM scope 1+2 (136,640 tCO2e) from March 2020, date of acquisition, until the end of the reporting year. It must be highlighted that VDM's emissions represent a 5% of the total covered emissions in the reporting year . Nevertheless, due to its recent integrarion verification was not carried out , but it is planned to be part of the scope verification for 2021"
"The Chugai Group has set Mid-term environmental goals, set final years, and contributed to the realization of a sustainable global environment for the three important issues of climate change countermeasures, the use of renewable and recycled resources, and biodiversity conservation.  In addition, we have set long-term targets for GHG reduction with 2050 as the final year. The goal of climate change countermeasures is to reduce GHG emissions in Scope 1 + 2 by 60-75% by 2030 compared to 2019."
"We plan to increase our energy efficiency up to 10% by the end of 2035 compared to the base year 2020. Building up on the 2025 target to increase reliance on renewable energy by 33%, increasing the energy efficiency is planned to reduce ACIP's overall Scope 1&2 emissions by 40% by 2038 compared to the base year 2020.To achieve the energy efficiency target, we are gradually replacing our existent lighting systems by modern energy saving LED lights. Additionally, compressed air conservation is being applied via reduced pressure operation and leakage detection among other compressor efficiency measures, which reduced the compressors' energy consumption significantly. Finally, there is a plan to gradually replace hydraulic machinery with modern, energy efficient all-electric machinery when they reach the end of their service life. Hydraulic machinery is expected to be phased out completely by 2038.Because all of ACIP's offices are at the same location as the factory, the target coverage is considered company wide."

"Target coverage: 100% of the Group Bouygues' Scope 1&2 emissionsThis objective is calculated for the CDP's questionnaire and not communicated publicaly. Indeed, The Bouygues Group operates in different business  segments and the Group's carbon strategy is broken down by business  unit. The disclosed objectives is a summary of the reduction target on Scopes 1&2 of each of the buisiness segments presented below:- Bouygues Construction 2030 : -40% Scopes 1&2- Bouygues Immobilier 2030 : -32% Scopes 1&2- Colas 2030 : -30% Scopes 1&2- Bouygues Telecom 2030: -50% Scopes 1&2- TF1 2030 : -30% Scopes 1&2Each business has established its climate roadmap using two scenarios, the focal points of which have varied from one business to another depending on their activities.These scenarios are based on the work of the IEA (International Energy Agency) and were carried out with the Carbone 4 firm.- Two types of 1.5 ° C scenarios leading to a low-carbon society have been developed:o The first so-called ""Pro-techno"" scenario estimates that the socio-environmental transition is based mainly on technological innovation which makes it possible to maintain GDP growth while significantly reducing environmental impacts (decoupling).o The second scenario called ''Sobriety” considers that the socio-environmental transition is based on resilience and societal changes by adopting new objectives of prosperity and social growth.- The scenario analysis exercise then consisted in projecting the current activities of each Business Line in these low-carbon transformation scenarios and identifying how the transformation of the ''business playground” induced by the scenario positively affected or negatively the activities of the Trade.- The risks and opportunities were thus identified, making it possible to understand the resilience of the current strategy of each Business Line in contrasting contexts of low-carbon transformation of the economy.Reduction projections were made based on climate scenarios and trajectories to set the level of ambition of the efforts to be made by the businesses. In that respect, the scenarios were chosen based on factor 4 considering a medium-term time horizon at 2030 and a long-term time horizon at 2050 as it is in line with the climate commitments of the public and private sector, namely that it is set on a path to limit global warming to 2/1,5°C."
"We established this long-term reduction goal(2.1% reduction annually), taking into account our company's average growth of 2.5% per year.But the domestic market changes so fast and there were so many elements that we didn't notice.

"Equitrans began developing this emission reduction target in 2020 and it is reflected in the Company's initial Climate Policy, which was approved by the Board of Directors in December 2020. Our aspiration to reduce our Scope 1 and 2 methane emissions 50% by 2030 was not publicly announced until the January 2021 publication of our Climate Policy. As such, while we were engaged in targeted actions to reduce emissions prior to 2021, the specific actions taken to make progress towards the stated emission reduction goals began in 2021. In 2020, Equitrans created a multi-disciplinary methane reduction committee to evaluate opportunities to reduce methane emissions, calculate the costs to enact these opportunities, and develop a plan to implement the projects to meet the 2030 methane reduction goal. This methane reduction plan, which will be completed in 2021, will outline the steps needed to meet the 2030 goal."

"Target coverage: Activity in Portugal. CGD has been developing several measures to improve its environmental performance and, consequently, reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The objective of reducing greenhouse gas emissions was defined taking into account the analysis of one of the main international trends in this area, the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). As such, a simulation was carried out based on the SBTi methodology of sectorial decarbonization ''Service Buildings”, as one of the most suitable methodologies available given the nature of the activities developed.According to the tool's simulation, CGD SA would have to reduce 38% of total GHG emissions (scopes 1 and 2) by 2021, compared to 2015. CGD aspires to be a leader in terms of climate action in the financial system by defining, for this purpose, a more ambitious reduction objective than the one presented by the aforementioned tool, in order to boost the development of projects aimed at reducing GHG emissions. In this way, a level of five percentage points higher than the value simulated by the SBTi tool was assumed, corresponding to a reduction target of 43% of the total GHG emissions of CGD S.A. (Scope 1 and 2) by 2021, compared to 2015.CGD assumed also the Business Ambition for 1.5ºC commitment, having publicly committed to aligning its business plans to promote the decarbonisation of the economy with the ambition to limit warming to 1.5ºC. CGD is currently measuring scope 3 issues related to the investment portfolio. In the second stage of this project, CGD will:1) define a plan for continuous improvement of the carbon footprint will be established, which will include procedures for collecting information on specific data on assets funded by CGD,2) broadening the scope of the calculation of emissions to other products/sectors;3) setting of Scope 1, 2 and 3 carbon footprint reduction targets, taking into consideration the guidelines from Science-Based Targets for the financial sector."

"This is the short-term, Scope 3 Business Travel component of our legacy science based target. This carbon target was to reduce our carbon footprint by 80% by 2050, though we have set two shorter term targets: 40% by 2020 and 60% by 2030. The scope covers all our reported scope 1 and 2 emissions as well as the majority of elements from our scope 3 fuel and energy and business travel. Expressed as an approximate year on year equivalent, these are 4.54% by 2020, 4.27% by 2030 and 3.85% by 2050. Please note, in 2019 we expanded the scope of our reporting to include additional elements which would fall within category 6, not previously accounted for. This includes colleague use of hotels, taxis and upstream emissions associated with sourcing fuels used in colleague business travel. These new elements are not in scope of our present target, thus our target coverage is 76.34%. 212.37% reduction versus 2009 baseline = 212.37% of 40% reduction target. We acknowledge that the very early completion of this target is largely due to business travel reductions as a result of the Covid 19 pandemic. We have subsequently increased our ambitions to reduce our operational climate impact and as part of revised climate pledges, Lloyds Banking Group aim to maintain a 50% reduction in all travel (business and colleague commuting) compared to 2018/19, essentially maintaining the level of reduced travel seen throughout 2020."

"This target is a combined  target for all 5 former ams sites in Austria, Singapore and Philippines, rolled up form the individual site targets. They represent about 25% of the scope 2 emissions o f ams-OSRAM overall. For ams manufacturing in Austria, Premstaetten, we are purchasing 100% from hydropower. and thus there can be no additional contribution. The target was missed by about 3.8% driven by increased output at two facilities in Singapore.Since ams took over OSRAM only in March 2021 there was no unified system for 2020 yet. We have set common goals for 2021 though."
"In the year 2019/2020, TK Elevator (TKE) set its new target leading to an absolute reduction of combined Scope 1 and 2 emissions. In the long term, TK Elevator aims to reduce direct emissions (Scope 1) and indirect emissions from energy purchases (Scope 2) by 50 % by 2040, based on its emissions in the year 2018/2019. This target has not yet been approved as science-based by the Science-Based Targets initiative but we plan to initiate this process in the near future.  This target covers all Scope 1 and 2 emissions of TKE, which are mainly related to its fleet of vehicles, its factories and its branches and other facilities. In the year 2019/2020, TKE's Scope 1 and 2 emissions related to the fleet represented over 60% of total Scope 1 and 2 emissions, the factories were about 31% and the braches and other facilities were close to 10% of TKE's total Scope 1 and 2 emissions.In our factories, branches and other facilities, the reduction in emissions will be achieved based on energy efficiency measures and increased use of renewable energies. In the fleet, reductions in emissions will concentrate heavily on initiatives for vehicle optimization and route efficiency planning. TK Elevator also plans to expand the use of hybrid and electric vehicles in our vehicle fleet.With its long-term target, TKE aims to reduce its absolute Scope 1 and 2 emissions in line in line with its commitment to achieve net zero global emissions by 2050 at the latest. TK Elevator is clearly committed to lead the way to a low carbon future, recognizes the importance of keeping global warming to 1.5°C and support of the 'Business Ambition for 1.5°C initiative."
"This is the long-term target for 100% of Scope 1+2, ending in 2050. The annual reduction is -3,2% from the base year 2019, with a total reduction from 2019-2050 of 100%. The two absolute targets set (Abs 1 and 2) can be considered as a science based target since it meets the inclusion and ambition criteria from CDP as well as the 1,5 degree target criteria set by the Science Based Target Initiative (SBTi). The target is an absolute target, where 100% of the emissions in scope 1 and 2 are covered. The target is calculated using the market-based scope 2 emission approach.Scatec purchased International Renewable Energy Certificates (I-REC's) for 100% of our electricity consumption in Egypt in 2020. The certificate from EcoHZ verifies that 100% of our consumption in Egypt originated from 100% renewable energy from wind power the reporting year. Additional information:Coverage for this target includes all Scatec's operational solar plants, in the following countries: Egypt, Malaysia, Brazil, South Africa, Honduras, Ukraine, Jordan, Mozambique, Czech Republic and Rwanda. Scope 1 includes fuel for operations and maintenance (O&M) vehicles on solar plant sites and, where applicable, for our country offices. In addition, scope 1 includes generators on solar plant sites. Scope 2 includes purchased electricity for O&M buildings on solar plant sites and corporate office buildings in the various countries listed."
"Alliant Energy strives to accelerate emissions reductions as part of its Clean Energy Vision.  In 2020, our fossil-fuel generation carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions decreased 42% from 2005 levels.  We also recently achieved one of our goals – to have 30% of our energy mix come from carbon-free renewable resources – 10 years ahead of schedule. In 2020, our Clean Energy Vision goals were updated given the significant progress achieved adding new company-owned wind generation (1,150 MW) and plans to implement solar generation (1,500 MW). The updated goals are:- Achieving a 50% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2030 (up from our prior goal of 40%)- Eliminating all coal from our generation fleet by 2040 (10 years faster than our previous target) - Adding an aspirational goal that achieves net-zero CO2 emissions from the electricity we generate by 2050- Adding a new goal that 100% of our active company-owned light-duty fleet vehicles will be electric by 2030Furthermore, Alliant Energy added another new goal in 2021, an initiative to donate and help plant more than one million trees – one tree for each of our customers – over the next decade.Alliant Energy's plans for a clean energy future are expected to be consistent with the carbon reductions and climate goals pledged originally by the U.S. under the voluntary United Nations Paris Accord.  Our company is participating in an Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) technical study assessing the relationship between company-specific carbon transition scenarios and scientific research on the projected emission reductions derived from global climate warming models. Key insights from the published study found that there is significant uncertainty between modeled predictions for achieving a global temperature goal and an individual company's emission pathway. EPRI's updated evaluation ""Review of 1.5°C and Other Newer Global Emissions Scenarios"" provides additional insights when considering how to attain a net-zero goal. This includes finding that significant additional electrification and continued fossil energy use could be consistent with limiting warming to 2°C and even 1.5? by 2050. Alliant Energy believes that our aspirational net-zero CO2 goal is within the range of plausible scenarios shown in EPRI's technical study to limit global warming.

"The target is a part of ''Daiwa Securities Group Carbon Neutrality Declaration” and it covers Scope3 including our investment and loan portfolios, business travel, commuting, and leased cars. In the future, other categories may be covered. This target will be complemented by emissions management methods for lending and investment portfolios. We will set intermediate targets for Scope 3 to align with the Paris Agreement goals by utilizing SBT in FY2023."
"In 2021, we set a new target to reduce operational greenhouse gas emissions by 30% by 2030 versus a 2019 baseline using science-based approaches (Absolute Contraction), building on BMO's Carbon Neutral operations (since 2010) and matching 100% of global electricity use with renewable energy purchases (since 2020).  Although ""% of target achieved"" is over 100, we have marked target status as ""underway"" because we have not yet reached target year end of 2030.Note that due to COVID, many of our buildings were not occupied and hence emissions in the reporting year were lower than they would have been during ""normal"" operations."

"Regarding GHG and energy accounting methodology, as SCG is a conglomerated company producing various kinds of products, which would have effected on the real performance of GHG emission intensity and energy consumption intensity if all product group were calculated as one product. To report better clarity of climate-related operational performance. SCG have improved the presentation of GHG and Energy performance data from SCG business activities for a greater clarity since 2016. The BAU (Business As Usual)  of each product group is calculated by intensity of base year 2007 multiplied by actual production of the reporting year. The summation of BAU of each product group is total BAU of reporting year. The reduction of GHG and energy performance was compared with BAU in level of product group, BUs level, and Enterprise level. The 28% GHG reduction in 2030 compare to BAU 2007 is covered scope 1 and 2. SCG set this target in 2018, based on Paris Agreement, Thailand NDC and Well-below 2C compared to BAU. SCG has used BAU during in growing operations expansion since 2007."

"To decrease GHG emissions from virgin polyester (PET), AME/BSI division will increase the total volume of recycled PET fiber in their Ladies-Sleepwear collection to 40% by 2022. We estimate this will save 392.13 MT of CO2 emission equivalents."
"In 2019, Enagás approved an ambitious Decarbonisation Strategy, setting the following absolute targets (s1+s2) compared to 2018, which Enagás will achieve through the specific measures outlined in its Energy Efficiency and Emissions Reduction Plan.• Short-term: cutting s1+s2 emissions by an average of 5% for 2019-2021. (Referred as ''Abs1”).• Medium-term: reduce by 15% and 41% our s1+s2 emissions in 2025 and 2030, respectively.  (Referred as ''Abs2” and ''Abs 3”).• Long-term: reduce by 65% our s1+s2 emissions in 2040 (Referred as ''Abs4”) and become carbon neutral the same year by offsetting remaining GHG emissions.Targets ''Abs3” and ''Abs4” were revised in 2020 to raise the level of ambition of the ones included in our 2020 CDP response - reference ""Abs3"" and ''Abs4”.In 2020, Enagás also set new annual emission reduction targets (short term):- Reduce 10.7% s1 emissions in 2020 vs 2019 (referred as ''Abs 5”).- Reduce 10.7% s2 emissions in 2020 vs 2019 (referred as ''Abs 6”).Targets have been established taking into consideration international initiatives such as We Mean Business, SBTi, Global Methane Alliance, Methane Guiding Principles and OGMP.''Abs 1” is a target included in the Long-term Incentive Plan, linked to the variable remuneration of all employees. Its achievement will be monitored until 2021. In 2020 Enagás reduced its s1+s2 emissions by 32% compared to 2019 (-31% vs 2018), a percentage significantly higher than the decrease in demand for natural gas, which fell by almost 10%. This reduction was made possible by the implementation of energy efficiency and emissions reduction measures. However, the achievement of target ""Abs 1"" will depend on GHG emissions generated in 2021.It is important to notice that ""% of target achieved"" is an auto-calculated field in the ORS system, however given that target relates to an average emission reduction over a 3 year period, assessment should be conducted at target year (2021). Nevertheless, the 2 year average emission reduction (2019-2020) trend shows real progress toward the target, an average emission reduction of 15% have been achieved for 2019-2020 compared to 2018.Coverage:The target covers 100% of base year (2018) and reporting year (2020) s1+s2 emissions, including 100% of operations in which Enagás has management control at the time target establishment. This is, assets in Spain."
"Our baseline value for 2017 was revised according to the GHG Protocol while setting the target. The target was reached already in 2020 mainly due to closures of the fossil power plants Moorburg in Germany and Hemweg 08 in Netherlands  As the target was already reached in the last reporting year, we are currently evaluating a new more ambitious target."
"This is an intermediate targets set up for 2023 on the emission associated with  gas sold for EDF group. It has been set considering a linear emission reduction between 2019 (SBTI reference year) and 2030 SBTI emission target.Partially because of the COVID-19, EDF group is in advance in 2020 to achieve its 2023 intermediate emission reduction targets."
"Abs2 results from two public targets associated with our commitment to achieve carbon neutrality for global operations by 2022. These public targets are (1) our commitment to source 100 percent of global electricity needs from renewable electricity by 2022 (See ""Renewable Energy Consumption"" in C4.2) and (2) our aim to achieve 20 percent reduction in energy usage by 2022 from a 2012 baseline, on an absolute basis (See ""Energy Usage"" in C4.2). Translated into carbon terms, these commitments cover 100 percent of our Scope 1 + 2 (market-based) emissions, and they will result in an absolute reduction of more than 90% from our base year 2012 emissions. We consider this a science-based target because it exceeds the 2.1% year-on-year emissions reductions required by CDP as well as the high-end projection of 72% absolute emissions reduction by 2050 from 2010 levels required to stay under 2 degrees Celsius outlined in IPCC Fifth Assessment Report RCP2.6."

"We are continuously improving our transition to a low-carbon economy, migrating from an energy intensity-based target calculation methodology to one that is carbon-based. We have tracked our South African Scope 1 and 2 emissions since 2010, as a member of CDP.  We also report some Scope 3 emissions for our South African operations  (which constitute the large majority of these emissions), together with water usage and waste in our direct operations in South Africa. We have piloted a method that caters for developing countries known as the equity method using local consultants. As a financial services provider our upstream scope 3 financing activities have data collection challenges and prevent the development of an SBTi approved target."

"SAS target is to reduce absolute CO2 emissions by 25% in 2030 compared with base year 2005. SAS has also set an official goal of 18-20%  usage of Sustainable Aviation Fuel, which support the decrease of emissions. The target year was accelerated during the reporting year. From 2030 to 2025.The result in the reporting year is heavily influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic."
"In order to satisfy the requirements of international initiatives related to the carbon neutrality target and to actively reduce greenhouse gas emissions, Hanwha Solutions has established a long-term absolute reduction target by 2050 based on the absolute amount for Scope 1 and 2. A 100% reduction target compared to 2017, the base year, was established. We have selected all sites as the target scope, and are striving to achieve our targets through activities such as minimizing greenhouse gas emissions from new businesses, using eco-friendly energy, capturing/using CO2, and reducing energy consumption."
"Carlsberg commits to achieving zero GHG emissions from its breweries by 2030, from a 2015 base year, which is equivalent to reducing total scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions 92%. This is supported by an interim 2022 target to reduce the GHG emissions from breweries by 50%, which is equivalent to reducing total scope 1 and 2 emissions by 46%.Target coverage: The target covers 92% of the total Scope 1 + 2 emissions, which is equivalent to the emissions associated with the operations of all sites (breweries and other beverage sites). The 8% not included in this target are the downstream (out-bound) logistics operated by Carlsberg.Our target is running over 15 years and if our progress is linear, we should reduce by 6.66% per year. The 33.5% we achieved by 2020, compared to 2015 baseline, is in line with our expectations and plan. Since 2015  we have reduced our absolute emission by 33.5%"

"Nexans worked in 2020 to set a Science-Based Target. The process is ongoing to launch the letter helped by consulting company. A working group composed of different CSR and R and D functions collaborates with an external expert group. In 2020, Nexans committed to contribute to Carbon Neutrality, Nexans could achieve a reduction aligned with the 1,5°C trajectory on its commitment perimeter according to the contraction method (method recommended by SBT and appropriate for Nexans falling under the category ""other sectors""). The current reduction path is therefore compatible with 1,5 degrees. In 2020, we established new targets, based on 2019 emissions (2019 base-year). These new targets have a Company-wide coverage. They cover: Scope 1+2 (location-based) +3 (upstream & downstream): Upstream Transport, Downstream transport, Business Travel, Employee Commuting, Waste. For a specific focus on scope 1 and 2, the emissions emitted in 2019 for this perimeter of engagement was 344,381 (= 130,017 + 214,364) tons CO2e. We target to reduce 2019 absolute emissions by 4,2% per year up to 2030 on this specific perimeter of engagement, meaning during eleven years, which is to say 46,2% in total from 2019 base-year to 2030 target-year. This is why the emissions for target year 2030 would be 185,277 (=344,381*(1- 46,2%). For the reporting year 2020, we emitted 232,391 (= 94,802 + 137,589) tons CO2e. Meaning 70,38% (=344,381-232,391)/(344,381-185,277) of target achieved so far. See associated figures into URD 2020, page 180. The 46.2% reduction target also applies to certain scope 3 items, elating to business travel, employee commuting, waste produced, as well as upstream and downstream Transport."
"In 2020, Synaptics set a goal to reduce our absolute Scope 1 & 2 (market-based) GHG emissions by 15%, relative to our 2019 baseline year, by 2024."
"In 2019, BB set GHG emission reduction targets, using the methodology provided by the Science Based Target initiative (SBTi), without, however, subjecting them for validation by the initiative. The submission for validation by the SBTi is under study, given the need to expand the scope of reduction by the scope 3.The established target covers 100% of the emissions for scopes 1 and 2, with a 30% reduction in GHG emissions by the year 2030, based on 2018 emissions disclosed through the Public Emissions Registry website (https://www.registropublicodeemissoes.com.br/participantes/1134). The reduction targets are part of a carbon management program over Banco do Brasil's operations. In 2020, BB announced the implementation of seven solar power plants (two are already in operation) and committed to offset 100% of scope 2 emissions as of 2021, in addition to ensuring the acquisition of 90% of energy from renewable sources by 2024.It is also foreseen the continuity of water reduction and efficiency programs, energy and resources as paper."

With the exception of responsible sourcing and product safety, the joint company's impact on environmental matters is marginal, because its personnel amount to less than one percent of Tokmanni's total workforce, and its environmental impact is generated only by the office and staff travel. The size of Shanghai office in m2 is max. approx. 100m2 i.e., 0,02% of total m2 of Tokmanni in 2015. (522087m2 total size)-Greenhouse gases excluded from Scope 1 and 2: Regarding the properties (Scope 1) other emission components' (CH4, N2O) CO?-eq impact would be approximately 4,5% of total emissions – and these are excluded due to the small amount. Tokmanni only sells fresh groceries (and have refrigerators) in 14 out of 192 stores it has."
"In 2021, the Group formally set up a target focused on CO2 emissions reduction (Scope 1 + Scope 2 market based) at Group level, approved by the Board of Directors, aimed at achieving by 2025, - 15%, following that instructions:2021: -3%2022:  -6%2023:  -9%2024: -12%2025: -15%.The base year to calculate the target achievement is 2019, since 2020 cannot be considered a good reference year due to the pandemic and related consequences. So the ""% of target achieved"", automatically calculated by the CDP system, must be considered taking into account the operational difficulties (i.e. lockdown periods imposed by local governements worldwide over 2020) faced up the Group over the 2020. Note that the CO2 Emission reduction target does not take into account any effect of annual conversion factors not forecastable"
"Aker BP has committed to reduce CO2 emissions  according to the Paris agreement, and has set a target to reach close to zero emission by 2050 for all our operated assets"

"In early 2021, SNC-Lavalin released its targets and objectives set to reach Net Zero carbon emissions by 2030 (Please see our publicly available document at: https://www.snclavalin.com/~/media/Files/S/SNC-Lavalin/download-centre/en/policy/net-zero-carbon-routemap.pdf)As stated in this document, SNC-Lavalin will be driving down its scope 1 emissions via divestments from energy intensive locations and activities, rationalizing office spaces and taking advantage of new infrastructure and regulations. In many jurisdictions, the latter will effectively ban the sale of fossil-fuel powered combustion engine vehicles as well as encourage the decommissioning of boilers and natural gas heaters in buildings, two of SNC-Lavalin's important sources of emissions.It is forecasted that, by 2030, these initiatives combined will lead to the reduction of about 94% of our scope 1 emissions compared to our 2019 base year. These reductions will be equivalent to avoiding emitting more than 52,000 tons of CO2 per year compared to the status quo.SNC-Lavalin's scope 1 emissions include: gas or other fuels used to operate buildings and facilities; purchased fuels for vehicles and equipment and; to a lesser extent of fugitive emissions of refrigerants."
"Decrease in absolute GHG emissions in the Gazprom Group by 11% and from mainstream activities of PJSC Gazprom by 13.9% in 2020 compared to the previous year is in alignment with SBTi criteria under CDP scope according to 1.5?C scenario.All natural gas production, transmission, underground storage and processing subsidiaries of PJSC Gazprom are within the scope of this target, as well as the ""other"" segment, i.e. non-core activities of Gazprom."
"In the year 2019/2020, TK Elevator (TKE) set its new target leading to an absolute reduction of combined Scope 1 and 2 emissions. TK Elevator aims to reduce direct emissions (Scope 1) and indirect emissions from energy purchases (Scope 2) by 25 % by 2030, based on its emissions in the year 2018/2019. This target has not yet been approved as science-based by the Science-Based Targets initiative but we plan to initiate this process in the near future.  To achieve TKE's global emissions reduction target, we set individual targets for each of our Business Units.The target Abs 7 refers to our Business Unit Asia Pacific (BU AP), which in the base year 2018/2019 represented 15% of TKE's total Scope 1 and 2 emissions.In the year 2019/2020, only 25% of the emissions in BU AP were related to the fleet. Therefore, measures to reduce Scope 1 and 2 emissions in this BU are highly focused on efficiencies related to energy consumption in the factories in China, India and Korea and its branches and other facilities, where the transition to renewable electricity is also considered to reduce emissions in the factories. The targets Abs 3 to Abs 7 are the split of target Abs 1 among all the Business Units of TKE. The coverage of all these targets together represents 100% of total base year emissions of TKE."
For CDP 2022 we anticipate achieving the 75% reduction as compared to our base year of 2006 in GHG  associated with Scope 1 and 2 emissions.  During CY 2022 we will be evaluating establishing a science based target and a new goal potentially  with being carbon neutral
The target applies company-wide.
"In 2017, we attained greater than 25% normalized reduction vs. our 2012 baseline.  We set a new goal in 2018 to reduce absolute emissions 20% from the 2012 baseline by 2025."
"ZE set long term sustainability targets in 2020 which includes Net Zero Target by 2030.  It is aimed to be Net Zero in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 2030 and across the entire value chain (Scope 1, 2, and 3) by 2040.This target covers all of our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. It is aimed to reduce Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 50% by 2025. The baseline emissions are 1,749,850 tCO2 which is decreased to 874.925 tCO2 by 2025."
"With the resolution of the EU on the climate targets (CO2 neutrality by 2050), we have set ourselves a first interim target of reducing our CO2 emissions in Scope 1 and 2 by 20% by 2025. This is a first step in a long process. When the goal was formulated, we deliberately only decided to take the first step, as we did not yet have any specific customer requirements. Since we now have the first customer requirements, we have a better orientation as to which additional demands are made of us. We can now better integrate these into our own target planning."
"This target has been calculated using the SBTI SDA tool for ""Services - Buildings"", and the ""Fixed Market Share"" projected output measure, and the ETP B2DS SDA scenario, for Scope 1 and Scope 2 (as defined by SBTI, with only grid electricity in scope 2, and district heat in scope 1). We have then transformed this into a 1.5DegC target by multiplying it by the ratio of the 1.5DegC/2DegC 2030 CRREM GHG targets for ""Residential Buildings, Multi Family"" trajectories.  We have then combined the scope 1 and scope 2 targets to form an overall scope 1 and 2 target.  This target has been submitted to the SBTI for verification but not yet verified.   This target applies to our whole operations."
"Our Abs5 target is a 50% reduction in GHGs from all NiSource companies and activities by 2025 (from 2005 levels).  In combination with our other absolute targets, 96% of our Scope 1 base year emissions are covered by our emission reduction targets."
"Due to a proactive approach to switching to renewable electricity contracts combined with investments in solar panels in several locations, the 2020 targets of 5% absolute CO2 emission reduction in our own operations has been achieved and exceeded ahead of schedule. 2020 emissions showed a 25% reduction compared to 2015 base year emissions."
"For Scope 1 and 2, we have set and committed to a science-based target, which is as follows: Minimum 35% reduction in total absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 2030, compared to 2018 baseline year"
"The same target reference number is used in 2018, 2019 and 2020. Our base year is a 5-year average (2005 to 2009). The scope includes 100% of Valmet´s production sites and offices at those sites. Valmet is using both intensity and absolute targets in its energy and CO2 emissions reductions program. This will be achieved through reductions in energy consumption. We target a minimum 2.1% year on year reduction of CO2 emissions. Due to recent acquisitions by Valmet in October 2020 of four manufacturing workshops, we have delayed our plan to submit our targets for SBTi approval until mid-2021, where we will set a new baseline and updated targets. Valmet has since 2010 run an Energy Efficiency Program and has as a result implemented over 220 energy efficiency actions in operations globally during the past 10 years.This target is 88.7% complete."
"We commit to reaching net-zero emissions in the value chain by 2050.  This target covers 100% of company-wide Scope 1&2&3 emissions. Base year and reporting year emissions shared above are company-wide total Scope 1&2&3 emissions (not only GHG emissions of Turkey operations).We will reduce our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by establishing renewable energy plants, transitioning to electrical company cars and forklifts, using low GWP refrigerants in the production etc. To reduce our Scope 3 emissions, we will increase the penetration of energy-efficient products in the market, increase our recycled material contents in the products,  using alternative low-carbon fuel for product logistics, etc.  To offset our residual emissions, we will apply plantation and other nature-based solutions to become a net-zero company in 2050. We shared our 2050 net-zero road map in the given link below: https://www.arcelikglobal.com/en/sustainability/in-touch-with-our-planet/combating-the-climate-crisis/"
"Replaced with Abs 3. During the transitional period from the merger to the end of calendar year 2019, legacy Harris Corporation environmental sustainability goals acted as the interim targets for all L3Harris sites and facilities in 2019. As part of our merger, re-base-lining work conducted in 2019 included collecting combined data for L3 Technologies and Harris Corporation to determine our emissions for a new baseline year as a combined company. This target served as the transitional period target for the combined company."
"Our GHG goal represents a company-wide absolute target related to both Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions: Our goal is a 30 percent reduction in absolute Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions from our global operations, compared to a 2014 baseline, by 2025. With the completion of our acquisition of the remaining interest in RF360 Holdings Singapore Pte. Ltd. (''RF360”), we reviewed and revised our GHG reduction goal baseline. This re-baselining was conducted with a third-party to ensure that our GHG inventory adheres to The Climate Registry General Reporting Protocol. Our GHG reduction goal baseline year remains 2014, but now includes RF360 Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. The result of the recalculation is an increase of approximately 130,000 metrics tons of CO2e to our baseline."

"The absolute target for scope 1 was defined considering a reduction of 10% in the emisisons of scope 1, including all sources of emissions identified  for this scope. The target also considers all brands and facilities in the country that were included in our GHG inventory."
"GETLINK is seen as ""committed"" in the SBTi. and Scope 1+2 target are currently under SBTi validation.  In the frame of the SBTi validation, the Group aimed to have the most robust and verifiable methodology.  This is why 2019 base year has been recently recomputed to ensure a  maintained, referenced and open-sourced data base along with a consistent market-based approach (updated emission factors are extracted from ADEME Carbon and UK Government DBEIS databases).  Please note that it is also a more challenging starting point than using the ''old” 2019 emissions factors that would have created a visible methodology bias in favor of our trajectory. This accounts for the reduction of the emission footprint between old-2019 (57867 tonnes, as per URD2020) and the new 2019 base reference of 46685 tonnes. Since this methodology has been respected for 2020 values,  the publicly disclosed 2020 values have not been changed. There is no target for 2020 since our trajectory is not linear. Target year are 2023 and 2025. 2019 base year emissions value is calculated with recent Emission factors that allows a consistent and like-for-like trajectory towards 2025 targets. 2019 assumptions are described in Environment Plan 2025 under https://www.getlinkgroup.com/en/our-commitments/csr/environmental-responsibility/"
"Due to recent increases in personnel and facilities, Hirose's  metric tons of CO2e did not meet the targeted reduction. Shutdown of the nuclear power plant a few years ago also contributed to difficulty in reducing emissions as much of Japan was forced to rely on higher CO2e emitting forms of energy. Hirose will continue to engage in efforts to decrease emissions and get back on track for next year's target."
The target is an absolute target aligned with the Science Based Target Initiative.  All operating business globally.
This is a long-term science-based target and covers 100% of scope 1 and scope 2 market-based emissions.
"In December 2019, we sold our Lindsey and Annex buildings at the headquarters campus, entering into a definitiveagreement to sell and lease back our Corporate Headquarters in Troy for the next 15 years. In 2021, we will adjust ourgreenhouse gas emission targets to our new facilities, including GHG emission metrics for employee commuting, and willwill co-manage our emission reductions in collaboration with the new facility owner."
"The purpose of our science-based target is to estimate the reduction potential. Therefore, we pursue a strategy to resolve the insufficient amount through reduction potential by comparing the expected emissions with the government allocation target although we are currently not officially joining the SBTi and responding to it.Through this, we have set a target to annually reduce greenhouse gas emissions at around 1% of average total emissions."
"VERBUND's target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 90 % starting from the basis year 2011 until 2021 includes Scope 1, Scope 2 market-based and parts of Scope 3 emissions calculated for fuels and air travel (2011: 5 million t CO2e). The Science Based Targets Initiative validated this target as science-based in October 2016, and the target for Scope 1 and 2 was categorized in 2020 as consistent with the 1.5-degree target of the Paris Agreement.This target will be achieved mainly in VERBUND's generation activities:- by the exit from coal power generation in 2020 (Scope 1)- by the switch of energy purchase for operation of power plants from energy of unknown origin to labelled green energy. (Scope 2 market based)- by the reduction of upstream emissions via reduction of fossil fuel purchase for combustion (coal and gas) (Scope 3 emissions from fuels)and reduction of GHG emissions in Scope 3 (emissions from business air travel) in VERBUND's administration:- by travel policies for employees, etc. (Scope 3 emissions from business air travel).In total approximately 99% of GHG emissions are going to be reduced by emission reduction activities listed above. About 1 % of GHG emissions are going to be offset by tools as Clean Development Mechanism CDM, Joint Implementation JI, etc.This target was based on the liquidation of VERBUND Thermal Power, which was planned at the time but not carried out, making anadjustment necessary: the associated targets will be revised in financial year 2021, taking the acquisition of the stake in Gas Connect Austria (GCA) into account as well as a new contract for district heat supply and the continued need to use thermal power plants to maintain the domestic security of supply. VERBUND has succeeded in reducing carbon emissions from the thermal power plants by around 70 % since 2005 and therefore contributes to the avoidance and reduction of emissions and to the achievement of SDG 13 ''Climate action”."
"The CCR Group adopted the goal of reducing business units' Scope 1 and 2 (location based) GHG emissions by 38% in relation to base year 2012 considering business units, which together represented on that occasion 80% of revenue. CCR NovaDutra, CCR ViaOeste, CCR RodoNorte, CCR SPVias and CCR AutoBAn business units had the Group's highest revenue and, together, they met this criterion. The target year established was 2034 (as this is a target based on financial years, the year that applies the end of our financial year is 2034). At that time CCR Group's Scope 1 emissions corresponded to 30671.0 tCO2e while Scope 1 emissions of these units totalled 16876.0 tCO2e (16876.0/30671.0*100= 55%) and at that time Scope 2 emissions corresponded to 6573.0 tCO2e while Scope 2 emissions of these units totalized 2042.0 tCO2e (2042.0/6573.0*100= 31%), resulting of 51% of emissions in scope. CCR Group's Scope 2 emissions at the time came only from the acquisition of electricity from distribution companies. In order to mitigate eventual variations due to changes in the composition of Brazil's National Interconnected System (SIN) for the distribution of electricity, business units should assess the performance of this goal in kWh consumed. The percentage of this target is completed in emissions is 98%. Calculation: [(37.23/38)*100=98%], considering the target of reducing business units' Scope 1 and 2 (location based) GHG emissions by 38% by 2034 compared with a 2012 target base year and considering the reporting year 2020, where the emissions`s Scope I and II had already reduced 37.23% compared to the emissions from the target base year. Calculation: [11,874.27 tCO2e (sum of this business units´ Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions obtained in the report year) - 18918.0 tCO2e (sum of business units´ Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions obtained in the base year) = 7,043.80 tCO2e.] Calculation: [(7,043.80 /18918.0)*100 = 37.23%.] *The figure provided is not considering the amount of emissions from the land-use change category. This new source of emissions was included in CCR´s GHG Inventory for the first time in 2017 and continued in 2020, to attend a new Technical Standard for Emissions Accounting Resulting from Agricultural Practices and Changes in Land Use- Brazil GHG Protocol Programme launched in 2017. In the base year this emission source did not exist."
"The KII's science-based goal is to calculate the potential for reduction. Currently, it does not officially join SBTi to respond. However, KII is pushing for a strategy to reduce shortfall through potential reduction by comparing the government's allocation target with expected emissions, and will officially join SBTi soon. Through this process, KII reduces GHG by 5% of its average total emissions per year, and some implementation tasks are certified by the government and are allocated additional emissions. It is expected to cut about 3,000 tons by 2030, and some of the cuts are being reviewed with external agencies."
"This target has been relaunched during Eni's strategy presentation in February 2021. The new reduction pathway foresees achieving net-zero GHG lifecycle emissions (Scope 1, 2 and 3) in 2050, in line with the scenarios compatible with keeping global warming within 1.5°C, with two intermediate reduction targets of 25% by 2030 and of 65% in 2040. Target Abs 3 reported last year (-30% by 2035) has therefore been reported here as ""revised"".The target is based on a distinctive methodology for the evaluation of all GHG emissions related to Eni's energy products along the value chain. The indicator used for this target (net GHG lifecycle emissions) is part of the new metrics defined by the methodology, which include Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions, in absolute and relative terms, linked to the energy products sold accounted on an equity basis. This list of products includes oil & gas, electricity and also new bio products originating from the circular economy business. For each of these products, the methodology envisages the inclusion of all material sources of GHG emissions generated along their value chain, according to a well-to-wheel approach. In 2021, the reporting model was further refined to better represent the actual use of the volumes sold to the market, including non-energy uses (e.g. petrochemicals) or those associated with decarbonized products (e.g. blue hydrogen, power with CCS). Therefore,  2018 base year data has been revised accordingly. The target communicated during Strategy 2021 represents the net absolute emissions reduction by 2030 of 25% at net of carbon sinks. In line with CDP guidance, the reduction reported in this section (-21% by 2030 versus 2018) represents an estimation of the gross emissions reduction, obtained by subtracting the role of CCS and forestry, that respectively have targets in 2030 equal to 7 and 20 MtCO2eq."

We are targeting Net-Zero until 2050 which is inline with the government commitment to reaching Net-Zero 2050. We have committed to declare Science Based Target initiative and are planning on to develop science-based target based on its methodology  in order to meet our goal. The emission coverage from the baseline of 2015 has been limited to the buildings of our head office and owned asset only but we have extended this coverage to 77 leased offices across the nationwide + 3 other more data center where quite a portion of emission is generated in addition to the existing coverage as of 2020 for Scope 2.
"We set a goal to reduce emissions in Ukraine by financing the projects of sustainable development, energy efficiency and ''green” energy for 70000 tons in 2021"
"This is the Company's long-term target, formulated in July 2018.An 80% reduction vs. FY 2013 by FY 2050 fits in with the target reduction 2° C by 2050.Accordingly, although we have not sought SBTi approval of our targets, we believe that they are at least equivalent to the 2° C or 1.5° C target.However, at present we have not disclosed our base-year emissions.The Scope 3 emissions during product use currently disclosed are for our products provided to the consumer sector and represent only a portion of emissions, not total emissions for the entire Company.In June 2021, the Company committed to a target of full carbon neutrality throughout the entire supply chain for 2050.The Company's products number approximately 450,000 types. Due to this large number, the Company has not yet established a method of calculating emissions during product use (Scope 3, Category 11).We believe in establishing a calculation method the following conditions will need to be taken into consideration:(1) The need to cover at least 80% of calculated emissions(2) The needs for objective verifiability and the ability to total figures with stability each year(3) The need to reflect the results of Company's reduction effortsThe Company plans to receive third-party verification of Scope 3 emissions (upstream and downstream) by February 2021."
"In 2020, the Group began work on the development of science-based objectives for the emissions generated by its activities worldwide (Scope 1 and 2) and for the emissions of the broader value chain (Scope 3). Prysmian Group started to implement an ambitious climate strategy adopting science-based targets, in line with the requirements of the Paris Agreement, and endorsing the Business Ambition (1.5°C) with the ''net zero” target expected to be achieved between 2035 and 2040 with regard to the emissions generated by its operations (Scope 1 and 2) aligned to a 1.5° scenario and by 2050 for emissions generated by the value chain (Scope 3) aligned to a 2-Degree scenario. The defined reduction targets are now being submitted to the SBT initiative, so they are not approved yet.As part of the decarbonisation strategy, Prysmian Group is involving all sites and activities worldwide in actions that include an assessment of the opportunities for energy efficiency, the purchase and production of renewable energy, and the reduction of SF6 gas emissions. These opportunities will be addressed by a Group-wide project coordinationand implementation programme. The progress made and new decarbonisation opportunities will be examined continuously, as part of our normal business processes."

In 2020 Sainsbury's committed to reduce absolute scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions 50% by FY2030 and 100% by 2040 from a FY2019 base year. These targets are consistent with the reductions required to keep warming to 1.5°C.
"A Science Based Target was set in the course of 2020. This target aims at reducing all of the emissions of Barco's complete scope 1+2+3 and heavily focuses on the biggest category, i.e. use of sold products (78% in base year). Barco will focus on efficiency measures in this category which will lead to strong reductions in the years to come. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic the target has already been achieved in 2020, however this also has to do with decrease of sales."
"BHP supports the aim of the Paris Agreement to limit global warming to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels, and pursue efforts to limit warming to 1.5°C. We have been active in addressing climate risks for more than two decades, and in 2017 established our long-term goal of achieving net zero operational emissions by 2050. This goal covers all Scope 1 and 2 emissions based on an operational control approach in line with World Resources Institute/World Business Council for Sustainable Development guidance. More recent information on progress against this and our targets will be available in our FY2021 reporting suite (including the Annual Report) which will be available at bhp.com."

"The scope of this target is all our scope 1 & 2 emissions. The main components are use of fuels, refrigerants and electricity in our stores, warehouses and offices. Up to 2017 we have reduced CO2-emissions from our electricity use by 96%, so the remaining climate impact from electricity use are quite limited. The main remaining emissions sources are therefore use of refrigerants and fuels, the latter is mainly use of natural gas in some of our warehouses."
"The stated target is not company-wide due to the target being South African buildings only. UK and US sites are excluded, with SA buildings accounting for 97% of company-wide scope 2 emissions. The base and target year refer to the financial reporting period ending June of the specified year."

Colgate also commits, as a way to reduce our most significant Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions, to promote water conservation awareness to 100% of our global consumers and reduce emissions associated with consumer behaviour by up to 5% from 2016 to 2022, and increase the recycled content of our packaging to 50% by 2020.”We achieved a median value of 5% reduction in emissions associated with consumer behaviour, relative to a 2016 baseline and based on consumer survey results from 2020. Reduction estimates range from 3-8% due to inherent variability in consumer behaviours."
"Aware of the challenges of climate change, Quadient is committed to reducing its carbon footprint. The Company has set targets in line with the well below 2°C"" trajectory to limit average global warming to 2°C, as set out by the Paris Agreement in 2015. Quadient has launched a low-carbon strategy to reduce the emissions related to its hardware and digital solutions and tackle its emissions related to its energy consumption.By implementing this strategy, Quadient aims to achieve a 28% reduction of its emissions related to energy consumption and company vehicles and 40% per m€ revenue of emissions related to Scope 3 targeted categories between 2018 and 2030, compared to a business-as planned scenario.In 2020, there was a sharp decrease in our Scope 1 and 2 emissions due to exceptional COVID-19 environment, following a notable reduction in 2019."
"In 2020 we set a new target to reduce absolute CO2 emissions with 35% from entire value chain (scope 1, 2, 3) by 2025. This target was assessed by Science-based targets initiative and approved as being in line with 1.5°C scenario.The target scope has been defined as value chain and we include scope 1 & 2 and part of scope 3 CO2 emissions (product use, suppliers, transportation). Percentage of CO2 emissions in target scope are estimated to be more than 95% from total Scope 1, 2, 3. We have excluded from target scope those scope 3 categories where we have small CO2 impact (e.g. business travel, capital goods, waste generated in operations)."
Scope applies only to domestic location Scope 1 + 2 (location-based) and excludes both overseas Scope 1 + 2 and domestic / overseas Scope 3 sources.
This was our last year reporting on our targets set from the 2015 base year.  This is a new target with a goal of reducing our GHG by 15% by the year 2026.  Note that our baseline for this target is likely higher than the target from ABS 1 above because this base goal is set from a broader scope that includes acquired sites that had not been measured within our baseline for the previous goal.  The scope of the figures represented here includes all Perrigo facilities globally that are either owned by Perrigo or that are leased in which direct manufacturing occurs.  Note that this  baseline will be restated next year pending divestitures.
"A specific reduction of Scope 1 emissions by 5% was chosen as a marker for measuring relative progress toward our overall goal of 20% total emissions reduction.Due to multiple M&A's over past few years scope 1 has increased based on Real estate portfolio growth. Based on SF intensity scope 1 has decreased. Additionally, we have a commitment to take our Suzhou site 100% renewable in the next two years which will decrease our scope 1 and 2 CO2 by over 2000 tons."
"Our Board has committed to reducing Scope 1&2 market based absolute emissions by 2025, in January 2020. All our GHG targets are based on Financial Years (1st July – 30th June) and cover England, Wales and Scotland as do our operations. Performance is a result of the national lockdown due to the impacts of COVID-19."
"After the interal discussion during FY2020, we revised our Environmental Policy in April 2021 and clarified our contribution to achieving a low-carbon society (net-zero greenhouse gas emissions) by 2050, our support for the objective of the Paris Agreement, and our phased transformation to a portfolio aligned with the targets in the Paris Agreement.Based on this, we set the following target with a reduction rate (-3.2%) above the Wellbelow 2 degree target (-2.5%/year).Reduce the FY2019 amount of worldwide Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions from the eight group companies by 35% by FY2030, and aim to become carbon neutral by FY2050"
"Covered emissions in base year as % of total base year emissions: total determined emissions scope 1 of 2013 / emissions scope 1 site St. Gallen of 2013.All production sites in Switzerland have a target agreement with the Federal Office for the Environment (FOEN) to reduce CO2 emissions and increase energy efficiency. The targets are agreed individually based on the potential at each site. An energy plan, covering efficiency measures identified as cost-effective by the EnAW (Energie-Agentur der Wirtschaft), sets out how the objective is to be achieved over a period of ten years. This initiative was implemented as part of the agreement with EnAW (Energie-Agentur der Wirtschaft) in Switzerland."
"This is a new target; 1 = We are still in the evaluation process. The figures are therefore confidential / not yet publicly dislcosed (hence the ""Intensity figure in target year"" is incorrect). In our Sustainability Strategy 2021-2023, we set ourselves the goal of reducing the CO2 burden of our investment portfolio by at least 10 percent by 2023. In the meantime, we have added another ambitious target to this goal.In the 2020 reporting year, we developed a medium- to long-term climate strategy in capital investment together with other Group units. It was adopted by the Hannover Re Executive Board in spring 2021. The climate strategy is in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement and pursues the approach of reducing the CO2 burden in investments on the one hand and supporting CO2-reducing measures on the other. At the centre is the decarbonisation of our liquid investment portfolio. Our goal is to reduce the CO2 intensity of our self-managed investments from the areas of equities and fixed income by 30 percent by 2025 compared to the base year 2019. This corresponds to an annual average reduction of 7 percent. In the medium term, we also aim to measure and reduce CO2 emissions for illiquid asset classes (e.g. real estate).Our approach is supported by an externally sourced ""carbon risk rating"", which provides us with a comprehensive overview of the carbon footprint of our investment portfolio and helps us to actively manage decarbonisation activities.This target is accompanied by increased investments in sustainable capital investments that counteract climate change or support the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations ( in particular infrastructure investments in renewable energies and clean transport solutions, but also impact investments) as well as increased engagement activities with various stakeholders (such as proxy voting, direct engagement or participation in PRI actions)."
"Scope 3 first 4 categories (purchased goods and services, capital goods, energy-related activities and upstream transportation and distribution), which are related to suppliers, cover an 78% of ACCIONA's scope 3 in 2017.ACCIONA has become the first Spanish energy company to join The Climate Pledge (TCP), an initiative co-founded by Amazon and the non-profit Global Optimism for businesses that commit to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2040—a decade earlier than the Paris Climate Agreement's goal. This target covers the reduction part of the net-zero target."
"Havíamos estabelecido uma meta de 5% ao ano para redução na emissão de carbono provocada por viagens de negócios. Tivemos uma redução de aproximadamente 80,93% , muito além da meta estabelecida. A redução foi do patamar de 107,8 tonelada de CO2e no ano de 2019 para 20,57 toneladas de CO2e de escopo 3 no ano de 2020 devido à drástica redução nas viagens de negócios realizadas pela Companhia. Isso ocorreu em função da companhia ter aderido a atuação 100% home office e não ter ocorrido nenhuma viagem de negócios a partir de abril de 2020. As reuniões passaram a ser virtuais."
The improvment between 2019 and 2020 can be explained by the implementation of our energy consumption reduction action plan and the COVID-19 crisis (production shut down for several months).
"Based on the historical database and experience, CTBC has determined medium-term GHG emissions reduction target in 2020. Our 5-year target reflects around annual 1% linear reduction from base year. We are also focusing on developing the long-term target through SBT to meet net-zero goals."
"SCOPE: Spain, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, USA, Italy, Mexico, Puerto Rico, Turkey, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Honduras, Panama, Guatemala, Ecuador, Dominican Republic, Paraguay, Uruguay, Peru, Venezuela, Portugal, Philippines, Malta and Germany.The company had committed to more ambitious objectives in the medium- and longterm, with a time horizon of 2050, when it aims to reach CO2 neutrality. But the Chairman and CEO of MAPFRE announced that a public commitment emissions neutrality has been brought forward, meaning that MAPFRE will be a carbon-neutral company from 2030. The company is committed to being a neutral company in the following years."
As per CDP2019 - Abs 1:RCL Foods targets 50% reduction in electricity through self sufficiency projects by 2025 which supports the  Government's target of a 34% reduction of GHG emissions  by 2020 against a ''business as usual” national growth scenario. The target was revised during 2016 with 2015 as base year due to the acquisition of Foodcorp and TSB.
"This corresponds to Abs2 of last year. The target has been revised. The emission result in fiscal 2020 is already below the figure of the target year, but this is because of a temporary decline in production caused by COVID-19."
"Bankinter to implement new climate change strategy https://saladecomunicacion.bankinter.com/prensa/bankinter-to-implement-new-climate-change-strategyIn 2019 Bankinter drew up a new strategy that incorporates the recommendations of the main international initiatives in this area, based on important preliminary work, and established short, medium and long-term objectives with the areas of the Bank that are most directly involved (e.g. Risks, Investment Banking, Asset Management). Also as part of its climate change strategy, Bankinter has defined a road map for becoming carbon neutral in 2020 in scopes 1 and 2,  that includes formulas for the reduction of emissions through eco-efficiency programmes, as well as their neutralisation (green energy purchase) and offsetting (indirect purchase of carbon rights for reforestation and conservation projects).Form july 2020, Bankinter is neutral in scopes 1 and 2. The bank offsets its direct emissions (derived from the consumption of fossil fuels and cooling gases) since the start of its Sustainability Plan in 2012: it joined ECODES' CeroCO2 platform, collaborating with the Amazon conversation project in Madre de Dios. Regarding indirect emissions, all the power consumed in bank facilities comes from renewable sources, in buildings and branches both in Spain (from June 2018) and in Portugal (from 1 July, 2020).https://saladecomunicacion.bankinter.com/prensa/bankinter-achieves-carbon-neutrality-and-completes-this-strategic-objective-for-2020. The 692 tn CO2 reported in scope 2 are those form first semester in Portugal. Since july 2020, scope 2 in Bankinter is 0 due to the green energy purchase."
This reduction is to be achieved by meeting the following goal:  Achieve net-zero methane emissions from our natural gas distribution business by 2030.
"At Phoenix Group we have committed to achieving net-zero across all emission scopes by 2050. As a financial institution we have yet to fully appreciate the full carbon impact of our investments and wider supply chain and as we gather data, model calculations and design targets over the next two years the size of our carbon footprint will grow substantially as the scope of the emissions we can accurately measure increases. After this, we expect our actions will show a significant reduction as we move towards 2030, and then on towards 2050. In 2020 our scope 3 emissions scope increased to now include a calculation for working from home emissions - this represents approximately 18.57% of our overall 2020 emissions (4,129 tonnes) and accounts for the 3.3% increase in total emissions in 2020.  We consider this to be in line with our targets as it still shows a substantial like for like emission reduction (if the increased scope was excluded) of 15.87%."
S&P Global has set a target to become a net-zero organization by 2040. This interim company-wide Scope 1 & 2 target has been validated by the SBTi and is based on our financial year. It covers all our direct operations and is part of the longer-term net-zero ambition.
"Within its 2015 Annual Review, Dexus set a target to ""Reduce energy consumption and emissions across the Group by a further 10% by 2020 using the FY15 baseline."" This target involves achieving a reduction in energy and subsequent Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions from purchased electricity and natural gas from Australian properties across the office, industrial and retail portfolios where Dexus has operational control measured on a financial year compared to a FY15 baseline. It was determined that it is more appropriate for Dexus to report and benchmark on a like for like portfolio due to property acquisitions and disposals and changes of operational control within the portfolios."
"Sacyr joined the Business Ambition for 1.5ºC in 2019, whereby it undertook to define and validate science-based targets. The submission of the already defined targets was recently completed (23/07/2021), being waiting for the initiative official respond to our proposal. However, we have modelized our target using SBTi absolute contraction method and criteria; therefore, we are confident of its upcoming approval.Through this initiative we aim to be aligned with the objective of the United Nations to limit to 1.5ºC the increase of global temperature at age-old levels pre-industrial.These science-based targets are aimed at reducing the carbon footprint corresponding to the different operations developed by the Group. Among the many benefits that they entail are:•to deepen carbon management;•boosting innovation;•anticipating legal requirements;•strengthening investor confidence;•improving profitability and competitive positioning."

The target coverage is for the PAN India facility and the targets are set based on financial years (end of the financial year is populated wherever relevant). The target coverage includes Indfrag's upstream and downstream activities that are not owned or controlled by the company.
"Through its actions, Orano intends to contribute to the fight against global warming and the preservation of resources and health, major challenges of the century. Developing access to competitive and low-carbon electricity for all in a world fighting against global warming The IPCC scenarios confirm it: to contain global warming to 1.5° C and continue to evolve in a sustainable world, nuclear power is not the only solution, but it is essential. The Paris Agreement on the fight against climate change provides for a sharp reduction in CO2 emissions and the European Union has set itself a target of carbon neutrality by 2050. Orano intends to contribute to this collective mobilization.  In addition to being convinced of the role that nuclear power can play in the energy transition towards low-carbon electricity, Orano has been involved in a program to reduce its own emissions since 2004 in order to contribute to the collective effort. The group made a commitment to reduce its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 50% between 2004 and 2020. Based on these results, Orano wants to go further in its contribution to carbon neutrality with a new target to reduce its direct and indirect GHG emissions (scopes 1 and 2) by 15% by 2025 compared to 2019 (thus 2,5% reduction per year, aligned to the French National Low Carbon Strategy - SNBC for French Strategie Nationale Bas Carbone, which is aligned on the below 2° Paris Agreement)."
"Our climate strategy is anchored in setting and achieving science-based goals to reduce greenhouse gases. As part of our 2015 to 2020 Sustainability Strategy, Colgate developed 2020 and 2050 science-based goals to reduce absolute greenhouse gas emissions by 25% and 50%, respectively, compared to 2002. Colgate collaborated with CDP to develop these goals. Early on, CDP reviewed these goals and indicated that the 2020 and 2050 targets exceeded the requirements of the ''Linear Approach” to a science-based goal, which is based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's ''RCP 2.6 Carbon Pathway,” one of the climate trajectories used for modeling and research. Our 2020 target also exceeds the requirements of the ''Sectoral Decarbonization Approach” to a science-based goal, which is based on the 2°C change in global average temperature scenario developed by the International Energy Agency (IEA).  This target was officially approved by SBTi in 2017.To meet the 50% reduction goal of Scope 1 + Scope 2 emissions by 2050 with 2002 base year, we should have achieved the percent reduction of Scope1 + Scope 2 emissions that we attained through 2020 by 2033 indicating that we are ahead of schedule to accomplish that goal.Now, Colgate is joining the Science Based Targets initiative, UN Global Compact and the We Mean Business Coalition's Business Ambition for 1.5°C campaign and has received approval for a new SBTs including Scope 1, 2 and 3 targets for 2025 and 2030, using 2018 as baseline that are aligned with limiting global temperature rise to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.This is the last year of CP reporting against the SBT above. A new set of 1.5°C aligned SBTs were approved in 2020 and are also reported in this response."
"Aligned to our ambition of achieving net zero carbon emissions by no later than 2040, the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) certified that this carbon emission target is aligned with a 1.5oC pathway. Mott MacDonald Group Limited commits to reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions and Scope 3 GHG emissions from fuel & energy related activities and business travel 25% by 2024 from a 2018 base year."
"In July 2020, TSMC was officially approved by RE100 as the first semiconductor company to be a member of this global initiative for renewable energy, and TSMC declared a sustainability goal of using 100%renewable energy by 2050, driving the development of green energy industry, and realizing a future for sustainable environments."
"This target covers all of our scope 1 & 2 emissions. In 2020, our progress to decarbonise our own operations continued, however with the caveat of Covid-19. Our energy efficiency programs are at the heart of our success. Our electricity usage intensity per sq. ft decreased by 27% relative to 2016, and 38% relative to our historical baseline (2013).  Having more and more stores proactively choose renewable energy contracts with their energy providers is another measure that is having a strong impact in reducing our scope 2 emissions. All but one distribution center (DC) are no longer under operational control, as of 2019. This has resulted in a drop in electricity and natural gas consumption as well as fugitive emissions; the intensity figures of 27% and 38% are independent of DC energy usage being reallocated as a scope 3 category."
"In 2010, Air Canada endorsed the global aviation industry targets set by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) to collectively achieve a reduction in CO2 emissions of 50% by 2050 relative to 2005 levels. This absolute target generally aligns with a science-based target of a 2°C scenario. In 2012, Air Canada (via the National Airlines Council of Canada) further endorsed the global industry collective targets through Canada's Action Plan to Reduce Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Aviation: a voluntary agreement between aviation partners and the Federal Government. This target includes the most important GHG sources of Air Canada's scope 1 emissions: jet fuel consumption. As Air Canada's operations have grown through the years, the achievement of an absolute reduction target is ambitious. Air Canada continues to improve fuel efficiency through many initiatives and is closely involved in the development of sustainable alternative jet fuels which will contribute to this target."
"In 2019, we committed to reducing absolute Scope 1 + Scope 2 (market-based) emissions by 40 percent by 2025 against a 2018 baseline. We will achieve this through energy efficiency in our operations, and renewable energy commitments."
"The target covers all our gross-global Scope1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions. This target has been set in line with the Well Below 2 Degrees Scenario. We target a reduction of 15 % from our gross-global Scope1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions, over a period of 6 years, which translates to a 2.50 % reduction per year on average. The target is also checked using the target setting tool of SBTi, which resulted in the same reduction figure to be in line with the IEA WB2C using the absolute contraction approach. Although currently, our GHG emissions have increased by 2.97% compared to the base year of this target, keeping our investment plans in mind, we still believe we can reach this target until the target year."
"Board of Directors has decided that Gjensidige shall be climate neutral by 2030, with 2019 as the base year."

Korea's emission permit certification goals
"We announced our GHG emissions reduction goal in May 2019. It reflects GHG emissions reductions that we have continually striven towards. It also reflects our expected growth in emissions due to our company's estimated planned growth. As of December 31, 2020, we achieved our goal. However, because of the unusual circumstances of 2020, we do not consider the goal ‘achieved' because we expect our electricity usage to increase to typical levels moving forward."
"In fiscal 2020, the final year of the medium-term target, the HOYA Group's CO2 emissions amounted to 406,176t-CO2. (Scope 1 and 2 standards) Compared to the base year (FY2014), the CO2 emissions increased by 1.3%, slightly falling short of the target, but on a per-unit basis (sales), the Group was able to reduce CO2 emissions by 9.4%. The HOYA Group has also established a new medium-term (5 years) target for the next five years. A new 5-year target of reducing CO2 emissions by 16% per unit of sales from FY2021 to the end of FY2025, with FY2019 as the base year, and is working to reduce CO2 emissions by setting targets and action plans for each business to achieve the Group's target.Specifically, at our production sites, we are promoting the replacement of equipment with energy-saving types, such as the use of ice thermal storage systems and high-efficiency transformers, energy-saving activities such as optimizing the operating hours of boilers and air conditioners, and rooftop greening. We are also striving to reduce CO2 emissions from non-production sites by introducing light clothing in offices, adjusting room temperatures appropriately, and implementing efficient lighting. At the same time, we are exploring the possibility of increasing the use of renewable energy globally."
"The absolute scope 3 targets established by CHIMEI is company-wide to include all Plants in Taiwan. The base year, start year and the target year are 2020, 2021 and 2025 respectively for the target. It is expected that the GHG emission by 2025 will be 0.5% less than that in 2020. CHIMEI will change energy use by adopting low-emission fuel of natural gas."
"In 2019, Enagás approved an ambitious Decarbonisation Strategy, setting the following absolute targets (s1+s2) compared to 2018.• Short-term: cutting s1+s2 emissions by an average of 5% for 2019-2021. (Referred as ''Abs1”).• Medium-term: reduce by 15% and 41% our s1+s2 emissions in 2025 and 2030, respectively.  (Referred as ''Abs2” and ''Abs 3”).• Long-term: reduce by 65% our s1+s2 emissions in 2040 (Referred as ''Abs4”) and become carbon neutral the same year via carbon offsetting.Targets ''Abs3” and ''Abs4” were revised in 2020 to raise the level of ambition of the ones included in our 2020 CDP response (""Abs3"" and ''Abs4”).In 2020, Enagás also set new annual emission reduction targets:- Reduce 10.7% s1 emissions in 2020 vs 2019 (''Abs 5”).- Reduce 10.7% s2 emissions in 2020 vs 2019 (''Abs 6”).Targets have been established taking into consideration international initiatives such as We Mean Business, SBTi, Global Methane Alliance, Methane Guiding Principles and OGMP. In 2020 Enagás made formal a commitment to set a SBT through the SBTi.''Abs 3” is a medium time frame target which was revised in 2020 to increase its level of ambition from a reduction of 25% up to 41%. In 2020 Enagás reduced its s1+s2 emissions by 32% compared to 2019 (-31% vs 2018). However, the achievement of target ""Abs 3"" will depend on GHG emissions generated until 2030.Targets ''Abs3” and ''Abs4” are considered to be targets in line with science. Given that the SBTi do not have a specific methodology for O&G sector that covers Enagás' activities (midstream), we have incorporated SBTi's main recommendations into our target-setting methodology. Note that we have used the compounded reduction rate (instead of linear reduction trajectory) to set the target's level of ambition following the guidelines set by CDP in its ''Technical note on science-based targets” making sure that our targeted % reduction from base to target year is ?1? (1 ? 0.042)^( target year-base year)%. We have increase the level of ambition of CDP from 2.1% to 4.2% to align with the 1.5ºC scenario of SBTi. Once the O&G Methodology (for midstream) is published by the SBTi targets may be adjusted.Coverage:The target covers 100% of base year (2018) and reporting year (2020) s1+s2 emissions, including 100% of operations in which Enagás has management control at the time target establishment. This is, assets in Spain."
"In FY2020, the total Scope 1 emissions from Implats was calculated to be 419 ktCO2e. This is an increase in Scope 1 emissions since last year (which reported 411 ktCO2e) and this can be attributed to acquisition  of Impala Canada and increase production at Zimplats.This target replaces the short term Scope 1 emissions target which expires this year."
"This is a Science-Based Target, set by using the sector-based methodology of the SBTi and SDA Tool 4.2. It is consistent with reductions required to keep global warming to 2°C."
"The information reported on Scope 3 are related to 2019. We will resubmit accurate 2020 scope 3 data in our CDP 2021 submission. In 2020, COVID has largely impacted our operations and the business of our suppliers. Repeated lockdowns have  been followed by measures against alcohol drinking in some countries. This has created situations where our supply chain activities have been stopped for several months in major markets (Mexico, South Africa)This had a tremendous impact on our emissions mix and we are in the process to revalidate emissions occurred during 2020.In 2019, our emissions went up due to growth in high carbon intensity markets (e.g Nigeria). We did not set a target to decrease scope 3. We are confident that 2021 will show a positive reduction from 2018 baseline as several projects will be implemented."
"Our Scope 3 target is based on Category 1 - Purchased Goods and Services which in 2018 represented 81% of our Scope 3 emissions. Our target also includes Category 3 Fuel & Energy - which represents 3% of our Scope 3 emissions.  Combined this represents 84% of our Scope 3 goal.  We have submitted our target for approval by the Science-Based Target Initiative.   Our emissions were greatly reduced in 2020 due to the Pandemic and  we expect emissions to increase in 2021 back towards 2019 levels. However, because of our science-based target program and planned innovations, we believe that we will be able to steer a course of emission reductions to meet our reduction goals by 2030."
"This is our 2030 target to reduce our absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 65% by 2030 versus 2015. Our absolute target aims to continue the success of our previous Reckitt 2020 GHG targets, within the context of SBTi and absolute, long term reductions beyond 2020. This target also includes our Nutrition business, formed from the Reckitt's acquisition of Mead Johnson Nutrition in 2017 therefore it is now company-wide. We have established a 2015 baseline for our new absolute target, as pre-2015 data for our new business units is not available or is not relevant due to business changes. Reckitt's absolute greenhouse gas emissions for scope 1 and 2 (market-based) in 2020 were 261,814. This represents a 38.4% reduction in absolute terms since 2015. This means that we have are 59% towards achieving our 2030 target [425,008-261,814 = 163,194CO2et; - 163,194 /425,008*100 = -38.4%; % of target achieved: 38.4%/65%=59%]. These greenhouse gas emissions are reported based on a market-based approach. Status: Target on track - greenhouse gas emission reductions are on track to be achieved, based on future plan and progress to date."
"In regards to the urgent issue of climate change, the Paris Agreement was adopted at CAP21 (December 2015) and Japan has also created a ''Long-Term Strategy for Growth Based on the Paris Agreement.” The final destination of this strategy is a ''decarbonized society,” and we aim to make this a reality as quickly as possible. Furthermore, in October 2020, the Prime Minister declared that Japan will be ''carbon neutral by 2050.” While balancing economic feasibility with environmental conservation as energy companies must, TEPCO aims to cut CO2 emissions originating from the sale of electricity by 50% that of FY2013 levels by the year 2030 in order to help solve these global issues."
"This is our first year in calculating our Scope 3 GHG emissions. According to our calculations 90.44 % of our impact lies in our Scope 3 category 1 GHG emissions, but we have also included Category 3 (Fuel and Energy Related Activities) and all our transportation related GHG emissions (Categories 4 and 9). All of these categories make up 99.48% of our total Scope 3 GHG emissions.We are targeting a 25% reduction on our Scope 3 GHG emissions until 2030, we have used the SBTi Target setting tool to create this target and the target is aligned with a Well-below 2°C pathway."
This is a new target set in 2021 as one more factory has been put into the accounting scope.
"A total emissions reduction of 20% is based on increasing emphasis on efficiency for both VIAVI products and business practices.Due to COVID-19 and the impact it had on business travel Scope 1 and 2 remained rather stagnant while scope 3 decreased significantly. We expect 2021 scope 3 to increase significantly because business travel will resume close to 2019 levels.  Viavi is under construction on a new Manufacturing site going live in 2022, in Chandler, AZ. To decrease the impact of C02 we are considering adding solar to the new site. Additionally, we have a commitment to take our Suzhou site 100% renewable in the next two years which will decrease our CO2 by over 2000 tons."

"The scope of application is the same as 2018.For 9 years, ALTEN has been encouraging its employees to use the solutionset up to organize audio and web conferences from their computer in a secure and interactive way. Thanks to that application, organizing meetings with employees at distance avoids their travels. This solution is deployed today for employees from eight countries: France, Belgium, Germany, Italy, Sweden, Spain, Romania and India.Professional travel for Group employees in France are framed by a travel policy which is also intended more responsible. This document reminds employees that alternatives to travel, such as conferences telephone and videoconferencing are preferred. Very rules specific in terms of transport are described and frame the conditions under which these movements can be carried out: train compulsory for all journeys of less than two hours and half; domestic and medium-haul flights in economy class; privileged use of ''ecological” taxis; etc.. In 2020, because of COVID19, plane and train professional travels have dramatically decreased. However, this situation is not representative of normal business. Although our target has been reached in 2020, the target is not closed as our CO2 emissions linked to plane and train we increase in 2021 compared to 2020"
Our target has been approved by Science-Based Targets initiative in Sep 2020.
"The reduction target is based on 2004 emissions, whose value for Scope 1 was 895,474.56 tCO2eq, In 2016, with the operation of a new production Puma I unit producing around 1,500,000 tons of pulp per year, a recalculation of the base year was carried out, the year 2004 was chosen because it was the first year of the company's greenhouse gas inventory.In 2022, the company's goal is to issue 704,000 tCO2e of Scope 1, which represents a reduction of about 21.38%. In 2020, the result of Scope 1 was 100.1%. It is important to mention that the company has the planning to implement some measures and technologies that until 2022 will make it possible to reach the target. Klabin started projects to reduce the consume of diesel and heavy oil in the pulp and paper mills. This project was started in 2004, when we changed a oil for natural GAS in Piracibaba unit. Then in 2008 we changed 2 to Heavy oil Boilers for a Biomass boiler in Monte Alegre Mill and did the same action in Otacilio Costa mill (2014), Correia Pinto mill (2012) and Angatuba mill (2015).  In 2019 the fuel oil boiler at the Feira de Santana unit was replaced by a natural gas boiler, in 2020 the Puma Tall Oil plant went into operation to replace the burning of fuel oil in the lime kilns, at the Piracicaba unit, the new biomass boiler, scheduled for 2021, replaces one fuel oil boiler and three natural gas boilers that will be kept on standby for situations when the biomass boiler stops.To reaffirm our commitment to implementing actions to combat climate change, Klabin is the first Brazilian company in the sector of forests, pulp and paper to be part of the ""Companies Taking Action"" initiative of the validation of our goals based on Science Based Targets.Science-based targets provide companies with a clearly defined pathway to future-proof growth by specifying how much and how quickly they need to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions."
"This is an absolute long-term objective for Alten, which takes 2018 as the reference year:-for 72% of its perimeters 1 and 2 (CSR perimeter), Alten undertakes to reduce its emissions by 36% by 2035 for the same perimeter (same entities and same activities in these entities), compared to 2018.To achieve our goal, we are implementing ambitious initiatives, including:- amplify our deployment of renewable energies in the group, starting with 17 entities in the following countries: France, Belgium, Netherlands, Italy, Spain, Sweden, Germany, Finland, Portugal, Morocco, India, United Kingdom, USA.

"SBT targets were set and approved for three businesses of the company namely MLDL, MWCDL (MWC Chennai), and MWCJL (MWC Jaipur) in 2019.  The Base Year for MLDL and MWCJL was considered as 2018, as the complete GHG inventory for all the three businesses was recalculated in 2018 (i.e., FY 19) as part of SBTi; whereas the Base Year for MWCDL was considered as 2016, since the most comprehensive GHG inventory data was available for the same.Reason for recalculation of GHG Inventory:Earlier, for Residential Business i.e.; MLDL, we used to consider the emissions from fuel consumption by our Project sites and Contractors under Scope 1; but with detailed inventorisation in FY 19 as part of SBTi, the emissions from fuel consumption by Contractors alone were categorized under Scope 3 as per the GHG protocol, and the emissions from fuel consumption by our Project sites alone were considered under Scope 1. Similarly, the emissions from Electricity consumption for our Project sites and Contractors were considered under Scope 2; but as part of SBTi, the emissions from Electricity consumption by Contractors and Project sites were separately considered under Scope 3, and Scope 2 respectively. The same process was followed for MWCJL.            Segregation of the Fuel and Electricity Consumption by Project sites and Contractors was not possible for 2016 (i.e., FY 17) due to unavailability of separate data for sites and contractors; hence the base year for MLDL and MWCJL was considered as 2018, as the complete GHG inventory was recalculated for FY 19 for the two business divisions - MLDL and MWCJL; whereas for MWCDL the Base Year was taken as 2016 as the complete inventory was available for the same. The target as mentioned in this section, is target set for MWCDL. The Scope 1 & 2 emissions for MWCDL constituted about 100% of the total Scope 1 & 2 emission of the three business divisions in the base year (2016) as only MWCDL was with base year of 2016. Please find the Scope 1 & 2 emissions calculated for the three businesses namely MLDL, MWCDL, and MWCJL in the Base Year (2018) and for MWCDL in 2016 as mentioned. For MLDL and MWCJL - Base Year (2018) – MLDL: Scope 1 - 47 tCO2e and Scope 2 - 315 tCO2e | MWCJL: Scope 1 - 97 tCO2e and Scope 2 - 845 tCO2e |For MWCDL - Base Year (2016) – MWCDL: Scope 1 - 244 tCO2e and Scope 2 - 2161 tCO2e"
"Scope 1 covers direct emissions from fuel consumotion of stationary plants (gas), from mobile source (vehicle fleet, petrol, diesel) and process emissions. Scope 2 covers indirect emissions from the purchase of electricity and district heating. The target for Scope 1 and 2 has already been achieved through a variety of energy efficiency measures (e.g. switching to LED) as well as through the procurement of electricity from renewable energy sources. We will set new CO2 reduction targets this year (both for Scope 1 + 2 and Scope 3, especially with regard to the Scope 3 category of purchased goods and services, which accounts for a high proportion of emissions)."
"The target covers 100% GHG emissions from purchased goods and services, downstream transportation and distribution, business travel, employee commuting."
"As part of the overhaul of our data collection system and taking into account our new subsidiary (MEDIA 6 IMG), we followed the methodologies described in the GHG PROTOCOL (https://ghgprotocol.org/sites/default/files/standards/ghg-protocol-revised.pdf), concerning ""Base year emissions recalculation for an acquisition"" and ""Recalculations for changes in calculation methodology or improvements in data accuracy"", to recalculate the base year (base year 2017), which results in an increase in scopes 1, 2 & 3 by 20%. We have chosen to retain the recognized GHG accounting methodology: the Bilan Carbone of the Bilan Carbone association. This campaign is carried out internally by a certified expert from the French Carbon Institute, as well as supervised by a certified expert from the French Carbon Institute.   All the subsidiaries of the MEDIA 6 Group (with one big subsidiary which is MADIA 6 IMG) are taken into account in this greenhouse gas balance sheet, except for our subsidiary MEDIA 6 Portugal, which will be integrated in the 2020-2021 financial year. The total balance sheet for the year ended 30 September 2020 from 1 October 2019 we reach a total emission of 11829 tonnes CO2 equivalent. Our goal is to reduce this environmental footprint by 25% by 2025, assuming 5% growth.In 2020 scope 1 has a total of 1,857tCO2e, the direct combustion emission station constitutes 99% of the total scope.Scope 2 has a total of 673tCO2e and constitutes 5,7% of the total scope. 78% of the total emission is Scope 3 with 9,299 tCO2e."

"In order to achieve the Group target of CO2 emissions reductions (Scope 1 + Scope 2 market based - reported in ""Abs1"") approved by the Board of Directors, it has set a further sub-target focused only on Scope 1 and in particular on reduction of natural gas consumption at Group level by -2% per year. The base year to calculate the target achievement is 2019, since 2020 cannot be considered a good reference year due to the pandemic and related consequences. So the ""% of target achieved"", automatically calculated by the CDP system, must be considered taking into account the operational difficulties (i.e. lockdown periods imposed by local governements worldwide over 2020) faced up the Group over the 2020."
"As Vallourec's industrial footprint changed considerably between 2008 and 2017 it was decided to determine its intrinsic energy performance from 2018 compared to base yr 2017.New objectives for 2025 based on new assumptions and based on the Group's new scope. They were examined to measure whether Vallourec's emissions pathway could fit within the SBT approach by 2025.Vallourec decided to join the Science-Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) in late 2018.  A first submission form was sent in the Q2 2019 leading to the validation of Sc 1 and 2 emission reduction ambitions for year 2025 (base yr 2017).

"We formally committed to reduce absolute Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions 50% by 2030 from a 2019 base year. The coverage of this target extends fully across the global operations of our organization. Our strategy to achieve this target is based on the commitment to procure 100% of our electricity from renewable sources and on our ongoing energy efficiency initiatives. This target has been set at a level with the goal of aligning our direct operations with an emissions trajectory of 1.5 degrees Celsius and achieving net-zero emissions no later than 2050. The targets were validated and announced in early 2020, in line with our commitment to the UN's Business Ambition for 1.5C. Base year Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions were updated from previously published values due to improvement in data quality during the digitization efforts of our inventory. The number was updated from 12,130 to 12,083 metric tons CO2e, which represents a non-material change of less than 0.5%.In 2020, we achieved and exceeded our target to reduce Scope 1 and 2 (market-based) emissions by 50% through our commitment to procure 100% renewable electricity for our global operations through energy attribute certificates. We are also conscious that a portion of this progress is attributed to reduced emissive activities due to the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent office closures. We will work to maintain these emissions reductions by the target year in the post-Covid world."
"As part of our 2016 to 2020 Sustainability Strategy, Innophos developed the 2020 and 2030 science-based goals to reduce absolute greenhouse gas emissions by 25% and 50%, respectively, compared to 2010"
"Base year emissions covered by target (metric tons CO2e);105.8 . We want to reduce by 10(metric tons CO2e,But in fact we just reduced by 9.6(metric tons CO2e) . So we've done 96% of the emissions.9.6/10*100%=96%"
"This target describes the first step of our SALCOS®-project. Under the constrains mentioned above, we plan to install a first electrical arc furnace, a direct reduction plant and an appropriate capacity of water electrolysis before the year 2030. With this first step we would be able to reduce our scope 1 emissions at the Salzgitter Flachstahl site by 30% compared to the base year."
"Coverage: Our Scope 1 emissions include emissions from energy use at our facilities; emissions of VOCs and F-gases from research and production processes; refrigerant losses from cooling and ventilation systems; and fuel use in our owned or leased vehicles (principally in sales and marketing car fleet). Our Scope 2 emissions include emissions from imported electricity, steam, district heating and district cooling. Data consistency and quality: Occasionally our sites receive updated utility information, for example replacing estimated consumption with actuals. This can happen sometime after the reporting period and when the reporting system is updated it can have an impact to emissions reported, leading to small changes year on year. Ambition Zero Carbon was launched by our CEO at the World Economic Forum at Davos in January 2020, where we committed $1billion to three main pillars of the strategy: reduce our Scope 1 and 2 emissions to zero by 2025; switch our inhaler portfolio to next generation inhalers using near-zero global warming potential propellants (first launch 2025); and plant 50 million trees globally by 2025 to restore the lungs of the planet. With the launch of the combined Scope 1 and 2 target within Ambition Zero Carbon, the individual Scope 1 and Scope 2 targets were replaced.Strategy: Scope 1 and 2 emissions strategy includes electrification of our 17,000 vehicle marketing fleet by 2025 in line with our EV100 commitment (launched in 2019 and strengthened in January 2020); doubling energy productivity by 2025 from 2015 base (EP100) through investment in efficiency and on-site renewables through ~$20M/year natural resource efficiency fund; energy audits to identify further opportunities; expanding our RE100 renewable power commitment to all energy sources including fuel combustion for heat. 2020 Performance: 60% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 emissions vs 2015 baseline, including 24% reduction in Scope 1 and 93% reduction in Scope 2."
"Prior to validation of science-based emissions targets by the SBTi which is on our strategic roadmap, we have set a new Scope 1 and 2 (location-based) emissions reduction targets of 15% by 2026 from a 2019 base year. These cover 100% of Scope 1 and 2 (location-based) emissions.  We acknowledge some of our achieved reductions to date pertaining to these targets are accounted for by COVID-19- related business disruptions and we anticipate some natural rebound over the coming years as the disruptions of COVID-19 subside, thus we consider the target status to be new and underway in the reporting year, rather than 'Achieved'."
"Implementation of an energy model in Villeret (Switzerland), our largest production site in terms of energy and materials consumption. By participating in the Energy Agency of the Swiss Private Sector (EnAW) program, we have agreed to implement measures increasing energy efficiency by 2% per year between 2015 and 2024."

"In 2020 Vodafone set an approved SBT aligned to 1.5C using the ICT sector pathway. Vodafone committed to reach Net Zero Emissions by 2030 for scope 1 & 2 and halve Scope 3 emissions from a 2020 baseline. This included an SBTi approved SBT with a targeted reduction of 95% scope 1 & 2 emissions and 50% reduction in scope 3 by 2030 from a 2020. For 2030 the remaining 5% maximum emissions for hard to decarbonise areas will be compensated with certified carbon removal offsets - reaching net zero for scope 1 & 2.This target covers all of our global operations and all of our scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions. The baseline year of 2020 was used with the following values (rebaselined this year to account for company acquisitions):  Scope 1&2 1,952,379 metric tonnes CO2e and 9,539,559 metric tonnes CO2e Scope 3 emissions. This covers all of our scope 1&2 and scope 3 emissions. Note: Abs 2 target only covers the scope 1&2 element of this target, scope 3 is covered in Abs 3 below."
Target to reduce emissions from business air travel by 20% annually
"This target covers business travel, with the primary contributor being air travel.  We are targeting a 30% reduction in emissions by FY2025 compared with FY2018.  COVID19 pandemic related travel restrictions resulting in a very significant reduction in business travel in the reporting year."
"In 2020, Ecorodovias's goal was to reduce 0.5% of its Scope 1 + Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions in all its operations. We achieved the  goal due to some energy efficiency initiatives, home office implementation and reduction in the number of business travels. The Covid 19 Pandemic also influenced our numbers, mainly in Scope 2 because we implemented the home office policy for all employees that do not need to be  in person in ours offices and operational bases. This caused one reduction of the energy consumption."
"In Q1 2021, we made several public announcements about our partnerships with a variety of emerging technology companies.This includes electronic powertrain systems, hydrogen and biofuel alternatives, as well as autonomous options. We are alsocurrently testing our first electric-powered truck pilot program. We are committed to staying at the forefront of technology andto finding alternative ways to keep our trucks environmentally-friendly while using renewable energy. For GHG reduction goals(short and long term), see page 6 in CSR report"
"Our Scope 1 + 2 GHG emissions target for 2030 covers 100% of our gross global Scope 1 + 2 emissions considering 2018 as the base year. Commencement of the target began as of the starting of 2020 financial year. Main strategic pillar & source for achieving our 2030 target is:• Procurement of renewable electricity.Considering this particular strategic pillar & source mentioned above and by the help of our energy reduction efforts till 2025, our scope 1 + 2 emissions target for 2030 is set as 65% with respect to our baseline year. This 65% reduction in our gross global Scope 1 + 2 emissions will be a cumulative result of the benefits of our energy efficiency initiatives, renewable energy installements, digitalization of banking services and our procurement of renewable electricity. We consider this a science-based target, but this target has not been approved as science-based by the Science-Based Targets initiative. We will follow the appropriate pathway for this target to be approved by SBTi."
"The scope of this target is scope 1 (stationary fuel combustion, private aviation and refrigerants) and scope 2 (purchased electricity and purchased heat) for our offices and managed data centers. For this target, we are not counting the purchase of unbundled RECs towards achievement of the target.  This is our long range target on our way to net zero emissions."
"This target refers to our emission reduction plans (Scopes 1 and 2) to reduce energy and carbon intensity through operational efficiency measures. In 2020 we have concluded the period 2014-2020 (reported in Abs1). In a longer term, these plans led to a reduction of 5.5 million tons over the period spanning from 2006 to 2020. During 2020, the Company successfully completed its 2014- 2020 reduction plan, thus achieving a reduction of 2.4 Mt CO2e above and beyond the target of 2.1, the extra reduction is due to a decrease of the activity due to pandemic COVID-19. In 2020 the reduction achieved is 440 ktCO2e. Repsol also defined a new plan for the 2021-2025 horizon (reported in Abs2) in a bid to achieve a further reduction of 1.5 million metric tons of CO2 by 2025, including, among others measures, electrification projects, the energy integration of units, process optimization and efficient operation of plants and facilities. This plan includes reduction actions from methane, that are included in the targets reported as Int5 and Int6, and flaring, included in Abs3 and Abs4."
"Abs8 is a Scope 3 tracking goal. In that context, 2013 is the baseline year; no reduction from baseline is relevant although we do calculate and disclose this metric: for CY2019 the CO2e decreased approximately 5.41% due primarily to a decrease in production output. Reduction from the baseline year will continue not to be relevant because this is a tracking goal."
"This is applicable to Scope 1 emissions at all our operations. The target is a reduction of 20% by 2025. Baselines were determined by analysing data over the period 2017 to 2019.The target has not yet been achieved, but continues to be pursued. We are working towards achieving the target by implementing a number of emission reduction projects.The target is not a science-based target. However, we will consider science-based targeting as we look to setting targets for 2030."
"Our target covers 100% of our Scope 1 and  Scope 2 emsissions. We consider this to be a Science Based target, and that our ambition is 1.5°C aligned, since our target exceeds 4.2% year-on-year emissions reductions between base year and target year."
"Measuring our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is essential in our environmental management process. The company has dedicated resources to measure and manage our environmental footprint and has committed to reduce our emissions by 35% by 2025 from a 2016 baseline. Waters reports GHG market-based emissions for its 26 primary sites (2018). In total, these sites account for over 80% of total square footage and include those with the heaviest impact due to manufacturing and research operations."
"In 2003, the Board directed SMUD to set a GHG reduction target. This target, known as Strategic Direction (SD) – 9, was adopted on May 6, 2004. The goal has been revised several times to add more detail and refinement. In December 2008, the Board added sustainable power supply as the overall objective of the integrated resource planning process. It stated the goal of reducing SMUD's long-term greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) from generation of electricity for serving our retail load to 10% of its 1990 GHG emission levels by 2050 (i.e. - <350,000 metric tons/year). Subsequently in May 2011, the Board added interim GHG targets for years 2012 and 2020, to establish a trend toward long-term GHG goals, and clarification for alternatives to achieve targets and goals. As a note, this target is set using the net greenhouse gas emissions and to provide stability is adjusted for normal wind and hydro production."
"switch of energy mode in Austria from ""normal"" to eco friendly energy mix"
"Our goal is to reduce our absolute scope 1 & 2 carbon emissions with 50% by end 2030 (BY2018) as part of our carbon neutral journey. This target is in line with the SBT methodolgy but not validated (aim is to have it validated by Q4 2021). In 2020we see a reduction due to different actions that have been taken, eg installation frequency converters in the plants, further investment in green electricity, an additional installation of a solar roof on one of our plants, etc."
"That target is a science-based: According to the SBT initiative a science-based target has the following definition: ""Targets adopted by companies to reduce GHG emissions are considered ''science-based” if they are in line with the level of decarbonization required to keep global temperature increase below 2°C compared to preindustrial temperatures, as described in the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)."" (SBT initiative, 2015: Sectoral Decarbonization Approach, page 7). The Evonik target of an annual reduction of 3% is even much more ambitious than described."
"This target covers Lenovo-wide scope 1 and 2 (market-based) emissions. The base and target years are based on Lenovo's fiscal years, so we entered the year that applies to the end of the fiscal year, 2019 for FY 2018/19 and 2030 for FY 2029/30. Lenovo also developed intensity targets for three scope 3 categories (use of sold products, purchased goods and services and upstream transportation and distribution). All those have been approved as science-based by the Science Based Targets initiative on June 30, 2020. Lenovo's approved targets are listed on the Science Based Targets website as follows:''Lenovo commits to reduce absolute scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions 50% by FY 2029/30 from a FY 2018/19 base year. Lenovo commits to reduce scope 3 GHG emissions from use of sold products 25% per comparable product (for notebooks, desktops, and servers) by FY 2029/30 from a FY 2018/19 base year. Lenovo also commits to reduce scope 3 GHG emissions from purchased goods and services 25% per million US$ procurement spend, and from upstream transportation and distribution 25% per tonne-km of transported product over the same period.”The Science Based Targets initiative informed us that Lenovo's scope 1 and 2 portion of our targets are aligned with a 1.5°C pathway. The ambition of Lenovo's scope 3 targets has been assessed though the target validation process and deemed as ambitious, although they are not currently classified."
This is a new process of awareness for the company.  These activities will start and internal discussions to attain the target will be set.
"In late 2015, MetLife set a goal to achieve and maintain carbon neutrality for all Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions from MetLife's owned and leased office facilities around the world, its fleet vehicles, and Scope 3 business travel by the end of 2016.  MetLife first achieved its carbon neutrality goal in December of 2016, achieved again in 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020 and intends to maintain this status moving forward. For the purpose of this report, we are reporting carbon neutrality as a year over year 100% reduction in Scope 1 +2 market-based emissions and Scope 3 business travel. The base year emissions are MetLife's 2020 location-based emission figures, which as a result of purchasing renewable energy credits and third-party certified carbon credits in MetLife's markets of operation become neutralized. As a financial services company, the methodology for setting SBTs is still evolving. A commitment to carbon neutrality aligns with forward-looking scenarios to limit average global temperature increases to 2°C and demonstrates MetLife's immediate and long-term concern for providing a healthy environment for our customers. Our additional ten environmental goals, including our30% location-based GHG reduction target, goal to achieve green or healthy building certification for 40% of our global office portfolio (s.q. ft.) and goal to mobilize 100 suppliers to set a GHG emission reductions target by 2025 further show our commitment to making actual reductions in the short-term and are aligned with climate science. MetLife looks forward to seeing how the SBT initiative will evolve in coming years, so that we can set science-based targets in alignment with approved methodology. Emissions reductions reflected to date have been achieved through various emissions reduction strategies, including energy efficiency capital projects, integration of sustainability best practices into new workspaces, office space consolidation in metropolitan markets to reduce bottom line expenses and maximize operational and environmental performance, and increased use of collaboration tools, such as telepresence, videoconferencing, web-ex, and more, to offset employee travel. MetLife continues to evaluate the progress of our 2030 target by collaborating with business partners to collect and aggregate data."
"We achieved our second-generation 2020 GHG emissions reduction target in 2016. Comerica set three additional GHG emissions reduction targets in 2018 as part of our third-generation goals (short-, medium-, and long-term targets). The base year remains at 2012 since our organizational structure has remained relatively unchanged. The current medium-term GHG emissions reduction target is: ''Comerica will reduce the total Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions associated with its occupied real estate by 65% below the 2012 base year emissions total of 80,533 by 2030, removing 52,346 MtCO2e from its carbon footprint”. We plan to achieve this goal through a combination of mitigation activities, rationalization and consolidation of real estate, greening of the grid, and possible renewable purchases. While we have not had our goal verified as science-based, we believe this goal is generally consistent with a science-based target, with an average estimated reduction of 3.8%  annually during the goal period likely exceeds the reductions need to achieve a 2 degree C trajectory. As of December 31, 2020, we have achieved 81% percent of the 2030 goal. The target does not include Comerica's Scope 1 emissions from Comerica-owned vehicles, which accounted for only 1.5% of Comerica's total Scope 1 and 2 base-year GHG emissions (and 1.0% of Comerica's total Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions in 2020). However, we purchased carbon credits to offset our Scope 1 travel emissions in 2020 and intend to do so for the remainder of this goal period."
"This target is to reduce absolute Scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG-emissions 100% by 2050. The base year is 2018 and the target is  approved by Science-Based Target initiative."
"Our absolute GHG emission target to reduce gross GHG emissions generated by our producing operations by 35% by 2030 (2019 baseline, covering Scopes 1 and 2) applies to mines operating in 2019, namely Kyzyl, Varvara, Voro, Mayskoye, Omolon, Dukat, Svetloye, Albazino, Amursk POX-1 and 2, and Nezhda. It does not cover future development projects and potential new assets. As stated, we will apply this target only in combination with our intensity target, which more accurately conveys our progress and it therefore our main reporting metric.A phased transition from diesel generators to low-carbon grid electricity (including RE), engaging with power grid owners and developing our own renewable energy sources alongside efficiency enhancements, will help us meet our absolute target. Upstream and downstream GHG emissions (Scope 3) are not included in current targets. However, as part of our efforts to achieve carbon neutrality, we have requested that key consumables suppliers provide carbon data so that we can further widen Scope 3 reporting across the most material supply chain categories. We are also engaging with contractors and will set a Scope 3 target by the end of 2022."
"In 2019, we took an initiative of setting a new SBT that aligns with well-below 2C scenario. This is a medium term target covering 100% of our scope 1 and 2 operations. We have already achieved and exceeded that goal by reducing the amount of business travel conducted using CIB's vehicles, and an AC Enhancement Initiative of the complete renovation of the HVAC system took place in two of our highest traffic branches using the VRV system, which in addition to its enhanced cooling capacity, involves operational and energy efficiency.  We also have applied more stringent measures to monitor refrigerant leakage and put in place a tight maintenance schedule to address any leakages as soon as they occur."
"CTT already achieved the 33% reduction target, with 65% emissions reduction since 2008 until 2020."
"In 2019, a new multi-year goal to reduce 2017 Scope 1 and Scope 2 (Market-Based) GHG emission by 3% by the end of 2023 (for our U.S. Administrative Portfolio, U.S. Large Pharmaceutical Sites and directly managed international sites) has been established."
"The aim is to reduce the emissions generated by the employee, minimising journeys as far as possible with the technological tools available. In addition, the renewals of the Grupo Cooperativo Cajamar renting vehicles are being replaced by hybrid vehicles. Within the new Eco-efficiency Plan for the next 3 years, new targets have been set to further increase of the entire  Group's vehicle fleet to hybrids. It should also be noted that in 2020 the emission factor corresponding to DEFRA 2020 has been used again, categorising the type of vehicle in our fleet in order to calculate our fleet more accurately.  Since 2014, 119 tonnes of CO2 emissions have been reduced in relation to the Group's fleet of leased vehicles. We have also recently signed our reduction commitment with the SBTs initiative with the aim of achieving zero net emissions by 2050. We will therefore set targets for reducing our environmental impact from an operational point of view  and from a business point of view.It should be noted that the Eco-efficiency Plan ended in 2020, reaching the proposed target of The Group has drawn up a new Eco-efficiency Plan 2021-2023 as a continuation of the previous plan. This document contains the plans for energy saving and efficiency, reduction of the consumption of materials (paper, water and other materials), the measurement of the Group's carbon footprint and the emission offsets. In addition, the new plan sets new objectives to be achieved in the coming years. Also,  the measures set out in the eco-efficiency plan itself, the 2020 results have been accompanied by the conjunctural situation in relation to Covid-19. About the carbon footprint, the Group  and for the third consecutive year offset 100% of the issues of GCC,  1,076 tonnes of CO2 were offset in 2020 by purchasing credits for the Conservation of Madre de Dios project in the Amazon, helping to reduce deforestation in the area, allowing for sustainable forest management and generating benefits for local communities.Finally, for the first time, an Independent Review Report on the Group's Carbon Footprint in accordance with ISAE 3410 assurance in relation to the Group's Carbon Footprint management in accordance with the WRI and World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) Greenhouse Gas Protocol: Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard, Revised Edition."
"TotalEnergies set a target to reduce GHG net emissions (Scopes 1 & 2) of its hydrocarbon upstream activities by at least 40% compared to 2015. The calculation of net emissions takes into account natural carbon sinks like forest, regenerative agriculture and wetlands."
"Target This target is approved by SBTi on 13th February 2017. The SBTi technical team and the SBTi Steering Committee have approved the submitted target on reduction of gross scope 1 emissions and scope 2 market based emissions. KPN commits to have zero gross scope 1 emissions and zero scope 2 market based emissions in the period 2030 to 2050. The long-term target of the company is to maintain yearly zero emissions from 2030 to 2050. The intention is to continue this also after 2050. This target is the follow up of SBT target Abs2 (zero gross scope 1 emissions) and we have already zero scope 2 market based emissions since 2011 by using 100% renewable electricity.Coverage: As result of our materiality-assessment 98% of our scope1 & 2 CO?e emissions are in scope. This is also mentioned in Annual Reprot 2020  Appendix 7 page 213 header. ResultIn 2020 our gross scope 1 emissions were 16,781 and our scope 2 emissions zero, so % target achieved 2020 was 82.3% (94,738-16,781)/94,738.Approach We will continue to stay climate neutral by only sourcing all energy from renewable sources and we will not use gold standard certificates or other voluntarily CO? trading. Baseline figures and targets are disclosed in our Annual Report 2020 in Appendix 7 (Table 5, page 214).As from 2015 we are climate neutral for own operations by reducing our energy consumption and using only electricity from renewable sources (91% of emissions) and forest compensated gas (2% of emissions) and compensate our other CO? emissions (7% of emissions) with Gold Standard CO? certificates. To stay climate neutral until 2050 we will have to purchase 100% energy from renewable sources every year combined with energy consumption reduction and migrating to zero emission cars."
"Years are both fiscal, that is base year is FY2015 and target year is FY2022 based on Zorlu Holding sustainability project. Because of merge operation with Vestel Digital Facility totally completed in 2015 and started third party verification, base year is changed as 2015 and base year's C02 data is recalculated."
"In 2020 due to the pandemic there was a reduction in operational activity, this is reflected in a decrease in emissions in all scopes"
"The target coverage was extended to the whole company in 2020 and is at current perimeter (Nature & Découvertes' emissions were included starting 2020).Due to significant improvements on the calculation methods, and therefore corrections to the 2019 carbon footprint, and the inability to revise the 2018 calculations, the base year is no longer 2018 but 2019.  The target was defined in accordance with the recommendations of the ScienceBased Targets (SBT) initiative. The sector-wide approach was thus preferred, based on the tools of the Sectorial Decarbonization Approach (SDA) developed by the International Energy Agency. Due to the lack of 1.5°C scenario data from IEA, SBTi currently does not provide an SDA option for 1.5°C targets, so the Absolute Contraction Approach was also used.The target coverage include emissions related to:-fuel combustion of the ""last mile delivery"" and ""repair services"" fleet (operated by Fnac Darty) -domestic fuel and natural gas combustion Refrigerants gas are not included yet, due to a calculation method under construction. It will be added to the Scope 1 emissions in 2021."
"In 2020, we set an ambition to work with customers, Government and the market to help reduce the emissions we finance by more than 50% by 2030.   We calculated an initial estimated financed emissions baseline for 2018, which we expect to evolve as methodologies improve and better data becomes available."
"We had set the vision to reduce our emissions (Scope 1 & Scope 2) to 0 by 2050. Hence, we set the 2020 GHG reduction goals respectively. i.e. -25% of absolute GHG emissions from 2014 to 2020, which we achieved. We consider the goal as SBTi conform since it is the same reduction path as the one used for our SBTI-validated goals (Abs 2).To continue the Net 0 path, we set further GHG reduction goals for Scope 1&2. Considering our old 2014 baseline, the target is to reduce absolute emissions by 60% until 2027.  For SBTi, we updated the caclulation towards a 2019 baseline. We added the Scope 1+2 target submitted to SBTi (and validated) as stated in Abs 2 below.Target coverage:We apply the operational control aproach: Emmi has several minority holdings over which the company does not have substantial operational control. Operational control is needed to implement reduction measures. With the operational control approach the relevant emission sources are included.Facilities excluded: We excluded facilities that Emmi has acquired within the last two years. This is along the Group's strategy of integrating new acquisitions step by step, and considers the time required to receive high-quality KPIs from new acquisitions.  We had to exclude the site Seymour of Emmi Roth due to a lack of data.                         Activities excluded:  We excluded the activities of global trade business (retail business of goods produced by others), because i) its emissions are rather irrelevant compared to emissions from milk production, ii) it would require significant and complex data gathering, and iii) it accounts for a minor share of revenue (<7%)."
"Colgate joined the Science Based Targets initiative, UN Global Compact and the We Mean Business Coalition's Business Ambition for 1.5°C campaign and received approval for a new SBTs including Scope 1, 2 and 3 targets for 2025 and 2030, using 2018 as baseline that are aligned with limiting global temperature rise to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels."
"Base year emissions covered by target (metric tons CO2e);210.5 .  We want to reduce by 10(metric tons CO2e,But in fact we justreduced by 8.87(metric tons CO2e) . So we've done 88.7% of the emissions.8.87/10*100%=88.7%"

"NPC has set absolute target which includes all plants in Taiwan. Base year: 2015 with 6,292,609 tons of CO2e emission; start year: 2016; target year: 2022 with a reduction of 3% compared with base year (2015) as medium-term target."
"Kia is pursuing Net zero  and has set mid-term targets considered for Net zero . However, Net zero  is currently being considered in more detail so there is a possibility that some targets will be changed in the future."
"The Board adopted this target through Resolution 18-10-11 as part of SMUD's Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) on October 18, 2018. This is an interim target on SMUD's pathway to reduce carbon emissions to net zero in 2040. The target assumes that SMUD's portfolio is comprised of 60% renewables by the end of 2030 and that interim targets as specified in SB-100 are met."
"Salcomp (Guigang) was built at 2017, after 4 years growth, the production value increased, and the management level enhance to higher level, the GHG inventory management enhance too. We have set SBTi target,  the targets include scope1+2, and scope 3, they cover all the manufacturing stages of our products."
"Our organization submitted this target in April 2017.It has been successfully approved by the SBTi. By the reporting year we have achieved a reduction of 1,310,000 t-CO2e.year target was set: fisca 2018(from 01/04/2017 to 31/03/2018)base year: fiscal 2014(from 01/04/2013 to 31/03/2014)target year: fiscal 2051(from 01/04/2050 to 31/3/2051)reporting year: fiscal 2021(from 01/04/2020 to 31/03/2021)"
"Through 2020, we achieved a 37% reduction in our Scope 1 (without fugitive emissions) + Scope 2 (Market Based) emissions versus our 2020 goal of 25% reduction.Fugitive emissions are not included in our 2020 goal as they are a small fraction of our Scope 1 + Scope 2 market-based emissions (1.1%) and are not included in the approved Science-Based targets. However, fugitive emissions are measured, third party reviewed and included in our reported emissions.Approximately 95% of our Scope 1 + Scope 2 (Market Based) emissions are included in this target. The emission sources that are not covered by this target include  a number of Colgate owned offices, warehouses and mobile sources (cars and trucks). These sources are included in our new commitment with the Science Based Targets and future reports.Our climate strategy is anchored in setting and achieving science-based goals to reduce greenhouse gases. As part of our 2015 to 2020 Sustainability Strategy, Colgate developed 2020 and 2050 science-based goals to reduce absolute greenhouse gas emissions by 25% and 50%, respectively, compared to 2002. Colgate collaborated with CDP to develop these goals. Early on, CDP reviewed these goals and indicated that the 2020 and 2050 targets exceeded the requirements of the ''Linear Approach” to a science-based goal, which is based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's ''RCP 2.6 Carbon Pathway,” one of the climate trajectories used for modeling and research. Our 2020 target also exceeds the requirements of the ''Sectoral Decarbonization Approach” to a science-based goal, which is based on the 2°C change in global average temperature scenario developed by the International Energy Agency (IEA). This target was officially approved by SBTi in 2017.Now, Colgate is joining the Science Based Targets initiative, UN Global Compact and the We Mean Business Coalition's Business Ambition for 1.5°C campaign and has received approval for a new SBTs including Scope 1, 2 and 3 targets for 2025 and 2030, using 2018 as baseline that are aligned with limiting global temperature rise to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.This is the last year of CP reporting against the SBT above. A new set of 1.5°C aligned SBTs were approved in 2020 and are also reported in this response."
"The emissions targets and progress in this disclosure, including this target, are based on the new 2018 baseline calculated under financial control, for the development of the Net Zero emissions roadmap published in 2020. New targets have been approved by SBTi at the end of 2020, following a 1.5C pathway. As the targets were set in 2020 but with a 2018 base year, the % of target achieved is a representation of company growth 2018-2020 prior to the targets being made. With our targets approved at the end of 2020, we will continue to work towards achieving our reduction commitments (20% by 2025, 50% by 2030, Net Zero by 2050)."

"In 2019 Impax put in place the target to source 100% of its electricity consumed globally from renewable sources by 2030. This target aims to effectively result in a 100% reduction in Impax's market-based Scope 2 emissions. As of 31 December 2020, this stood at 62% across the Company; representing the share from Impax's London office which purchases 100% certified renewable electricity. Our Portsmouth, NH office has also made the switch to entirely renewably sourced electricity in effect from January 1st 2021, taking Impax wide sourcing of electricity from renewable sources to 98%. This will be reflected in our reporting for CY2021. This objective is harder to achieve in Hong Kong and we are currently exploring options to achieve our target for this location. We consider this a science-based target since according to the SBTi, targets to actively source renewable electricity at a rate that is consistent with 1.5°C scenarios are an acceptable alternative to [science-based] scope 2 emission reduction targets. The SBTi has identified 100% renewable electricity procurement by 2030 as thresholds for this approach in line with the recommendations of RE100.Please see: https://sciencebasedtargets.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/SBTi-criteria.pdf"
"In 2016 we established a goal to reduce absolute GHG emissions 12 percent by 2025 throughout our global ground operations. This goal built on our ongoing efforts to achieve a 20 percent reduction in GHG intensity by 2020, which we continued to measure and report. In 2020, UPS broadened our Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) vision and built a road map on three generations of sustainability goals. Announced in June of 2021, the environmental sustainability goal is to  achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. The road map to carbon neutrality by 2050 includes the following targets:By 2025*25% renewable electricity for facilities (existing goal).*40% alternative fuel purchases as a percent of total ground fuel (existing goal).By 2035*30% sustainable aviation fuel.*100% renewable electricity for facilities.*50% reduction in CO2 per package delivered for global small package (2020 baseline).The use of renewable energy will be critical to reaching this absolute emissions reduction target. This  goal will advance our commitment to alternative fuels and technologies."
"During 2018 Melia Hotels International has defined several targets aline with Science- Based Target iniciative which are being implementing in 2019.In 2020 we measure emissions of our Aggregated perimeter in 100% compared to 76% in 2019, recalculating our base year and the following to directly compared with our current reporting year emissions, ensuring ''like with like” comparisons over time.Summary, emissions have changed compared to the previous year due to various emission reduction activities and changes in boundary. But it was also a significant reduction of emissions due to a decrease in our commercial activity due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2020 just as we started the new year, COVID-19 global pandemic was declared by WHO, with a particularly dramatic impact on the travel industry. Over the last year, our Company has lost more than 77% of its revenues, with similar falls in number of travelers and air traffic worldwide.Recently, we have expressed our commitment to the Business Ambition For 1.5 ° C initiative, being part of the companies that are leading the transition to zero carbon emissions by setting emission reduction targets through the Science Based Targets Initiative. Our new SBTi Targets was also submitted to the SBTi for an official evaluation during this year."

The reduction ratio in 2020 was 26.3%, improved from the previous year's ratio of 20.1%. This is the part of GHG reduction targets towards realizing a carbon-free society."
"To expand our efforts and work with others in the fight against climate change, we committed to the Science-Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) in December 2020, which aims to drive ambitious action by enabling companies to set science-based, GHG emissions reduction targets to assist with limiting global warming. As the first global marketer of fruits and vegetables to announce our partnership with the initiative in 2020, this is a significant milestone for us. To help us manage our emissions, as well as water and waste, we utilize a proprietary environmental action tool and database that allows us to track data facility by facility, covering 100 percent of our global operations. This tool, created in accordance with rigorous emissions calculation methodologies, allows us to calculate our company-wide scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions, and gives us the data we need to set GHG emissions baselines and develop our science-based targets. We convened a cross cutting group of executives this year to develop our Science Based Target. Our teams determined our target, and achieved internal validation. Our next step is to await validation from the SBTi organization that our target is SBT approved. However, the internal work is already underway. Our Scope 3 target has a 2020  base year and is enterprise (company)-wide . We utilized a 2020 base year, as our data quality was higher than it was in 2019."

"A science based target was calculated using the SDA methodology for a financial services organisation, this provided a target that was already surpassed in the 2016 period. Due to this a target was developed based around a additional target for a 30% reduction in energy consumption (accounting for degree days) by 2020 from a 2013 baseline.In 2017, DLG set a target of 57% reduction of our Scope 1 & 2 emission by Dec 2020 on a like-for-like basis against a 2013 baseline.   We achieved our target by Q1 in 2020, and finished the year with a 69% reduction in our scope 1 and 2 emissions.  The actual figure for 2020 was 12,137 tonnes of CO2 emissions against a baseline of 29,909 TCO2e in 2013.In August 2020. DLG announced it commitment to set Science-based targets. These will be long-term targets and we intend to set these in the next 2 years, following the SBTi protocol.   We are currently working through submitting our Science Based Targets for validation, and we have set a 50% reduction of our Scope 1,2 and 3 by 2030, which is aligned to the 1.5C."
"The targeted carbon emissions in percentage for Scope 2 is established in year 2013 for Resorts World Sentosa premises and do not cover other locations outside of Sentosa.  This is due to the other properties being developed after year 2013. Genting Singapore will review our carbon emissions targets in 2021 to include all locations as well as Scope 1, 2 and 3.As business operations are also impacted by COVID-19 in year 2020, it must be noted that there is a drastic decrease in the carbon emissions due to the drop in activities."

"In 2019, Clariant successfully closed the divestment of its Healthcare Packaging business and agreed to sell its entire Masterbatches business to PolyOne, which was concluded in July 2020 to form the new company Avient. As part of the portfolio repositioning announced in 2018, Clariant also continues with the divestment of its Pigments business, which it expects to conclude by the end of 2021. This will allow Clariant to focus on the three core Business Areas that offer differentiated products and services with above-average growth potential. Therefore, the target proposal focuses on the continuing business of Clariant.We have collected the 2019 environmental key figure data from all production sites, except from those smaller sites having a very limited footprint. The sites not included are considered irrelevant in relation to the total emission. The total sum of sites excluded is lower than 0.5% of the group-wide Scope 1 and 2 emissions. The full scope of key figure data collection from all production sites (including the smaller sites) is done every 3 years, of which the latest was done for the 2017 full year. This approach has been externally verified by PwC."

"In July 2018, Brother Industries, Ltd.  announces that its mid-term targets for CO2 emissions reduction set out in the ""Brother Group Environmental Vision 2050"" have been approved by the international environmental initiative ""Science Based Targets initiative"" as the science-based reduction targets for achieving the Paris Agreement's goal of limiting global warming to well below ""2 degrees Celsius."" The Brother Group identifies CO2 emissions reduction as one of the priorities in the ""Brother Group Environmental Vision 2050,"" a long-term environmental vision towards 2050. The mid-term targets for CO2 emissions reduction, which were recognized as science-based targets this time, were set based on the view that worsening worldwide climate change is a serious social challenge and a business risk for the Brother Group that need to be addressed continuously for years. The Group's reduction targets have been expanded to include CO2 emissions from its value chain that account for more than 90% of its total CO2 emissions (Scope 3) in addition to CO2 emissions from office activities (Scope1 and 2), which the Group has already been addressing. Focusing on these scopes, the Brother Group contributes to preventing climate change.

"Vale's scope 3 emissions, annually calculated and verified by independent third parties, represents 98% of its total emissions and are not under its direct control. In 2020, Vale committed to a target to reduce scope 3 net emissions by 15% until 2035, with 2018 as baseline, which are based on development of new products, nature-based solutions, partnership and engagement with clients and suppliers. The scope 3 target will be revised every five year, given the uncertainties regarding low carbon technologies and climate policies. Both targets are aligned with the Paris Agreement ambition. The fall in Scope 3 emissions by 18% in 2020 compared to 2018 (base year), is due to the reduction in sales, especially pellets by 27.7% and iron ore by 5.4%, justified by the production decrease and Vale's emissions profile strongly correlated to production. Despite of the 18% of reduction in Scope 3 achieved in 2020, Scope 3 emissions are expected to increase due to the production levels growth to ~400 Mtpa of iron ore."

"According to Itaú Unibanco, in 2018 they revisited its emissions targets and started using the Science Based Targets methodology for Scopes 1 and 2.Therefore, Itaú Unibanco set the targets for this new methodology. In 2020, its Scope 2 emissions from operations in Brazil totaled 29,196.15 tCO2e. Its scope 2 target reflects its indirect contribution in GHG gases to all its facilities in Brazil, excluding external ones in Latin America, which results in a coverage of 89.26% of its operating revenue. Itaú Unibanco is public committed to reduce its scope 2 emissions by 6% between 2018 and 2021 in absolute terms, which is already achieved. During 2021, Itaú-Unibanco will define new scope 2 emissions reduction targets."
"Due to the singularity of reporting year 2020 (COVID-19 pandemic) and the subsequent obligatory teleworking for our employees whose tasks did not require them to be on site, the assumptions used for the calculation of employee commuting-related emissions were adapted and the emissions are of course drastically smaller compared to past years. Nonetheless, these circumstances have led us to rethink our way of working and may lead to an actual decrease in employee commuting-related emissions in the coming years."
"We have revised this target so that emission of tier 2 and higher suppliers can be included. This revised target was approved by SBTi in April, 2021.We are making steady progress in reducing emissions through the following measures: First, we will work with our suppliers to reduce category1 emission through the annual survey via CDP supply chain program, a recognition/award program, etc. Second, the reduction of our scope1&2 will lead to the reduced category3 emission. Third, we will improve energy efficiency of our products to reduce the category11 emission."
"This target is the long time-frame of target Abs-1. As part of our Deep Decarbonization Path, the General Shareholder Meeting has approved our ambition to reach carbon neutrality in 2050.

"In January 2020 we publicly launched our new climate strategy Ambition Zero Carbon, including the goal to be carbon negative across our entire value chain (all Scope 3 sources) by 2030, bringing forward decarbonisation plans by more than a decade. The coverage therefore, is 100% of Scope 3 emissions.  This new target supersedes our previous value chain target that was intensity based.The estimated total emissions are from the combined 15 GHG Protocol Scope 3 categories, a combination of some primary datasets (minority) and some secondary (majority). Achievement of this target will not follow a linear glidepath, there is still significant effort being invested in better calculation and understanding of our biggest Scope 3 sources, principally within Category 1 Purchased goods and services, where spend data is used to estimate the carbon emissions associated with each procurement category according to the CEDA database of emissions factors. Our Scope 3 Targets as submitted to SBTi for verification:Reduce absolute Scope 3 GHG emissions 50% by 2030 from a 2019 base year and go beyond SBTi Net Zero by 2030. Achievement will be through the following absolute, engagement, and renewable energy targets:Absolute: •C3 fuel and energy related activities, C8 upstream leased assets and C13 downstream leased asset: 80% by 2030 from a 2019 base year, with an interim target of 60% by 2025•C4 upstream transportation and distribution, C5 waste generated in operations, C6 business travel: 46% by 2030 from a 2019 base year, with an interim target of 23% by 2025•C11 use of sold products: (within AstraZeneca's inhaler portfolio) 95% by 2030 from a 2019 base year, with an interim target to launch its first next generation inhaler by 2025•C7 employee commuting and working from home, C12 end of life treatment of sold products: 46% by 2030 from a 2019 base year, with an interim target of 100% primary data by 2025Engagement:  100% of its suppliers by spend covering all relevant upstream and downstream Scope 3 categories (C1, C2, C4, C6) will have SBTs by 2030, net of any reasonable exclusions based upon:•Supplier size•Spend threshold with individual suppliers•Procurement category i.e. spend areas that are not feasible to include•Term of commitment with supplier"

"This is a revised absolute target setting in this year based on 2018 since the most accurate Scope 3 tCO2e of the 5 years Use of Sold Products is less than 66% weight of AOI Scope 3 in our latest FY2018 annual report. In order to have more than 2/3 of total scope 3 for SBTi comment, we need to combine both Purchased Goods and Services and Use of Sold Products science-based target in Abs3 target.  Please see the following previous comments from SBTi on 10/11/2018 for reference:Scope 3 boundary:Requirement C14 – Boundary: Companies must set one or more emission reduction targets that collectively cover at least 2/3 of total scope 3 emissions.  Recommendation As per your query answer, base year inventory was significantly overestimated. In the possession of the more accurate data, scope 3 target only covers 24% (category 1) instead of a minimum of 66.7%. Please consider using the most recent base year and set a target based on the accurate data including at least 2/3 of total scope 3 emissionsAOI Action on 12/18/2018: (Abs3):  [Applied Optoelectronics Inc] commits to reduce the absolute [Scope 3 Purchase Goods and Services +Use of sold Products] GHG emissions [90] % by [2031] from a [2016] base-year. AOI received 2nd SBTi comments on 3/5/2019: Rationale: According to your submission form and query answers the scope 3 target addressing emissions from use of sold products cannot be considered measures to reduce emissions, but rather aspects of recalculating an overestimated base year inventory. Recommendation: Please consider using the most accurate scope 3 inventory as baseline in order to be representative of the value chain and set a target that meets at least one of the 3 options above in terms of ambition.AOI Action in 6/6/2019: AOI spent more resource to complete a most accurate scope 3 inventory calculation in FY2018.   The tCo2e of Use of Sold Product emission is more than 59% but still less than 66.6% of total Scope 3. The tCo2e of Purchased Goods and Services emission is more than 20% of total Scope 3. The sum of Use of Sold Products and Purchased Goods and Services is more than 66.6 % of total Scope 3 emissions in most recent base year 2018.We revised our Abs3 as following:[Applied Optoelectronics Inc] commits to reduce the absolute [Scope 3 Use of sold Products] GHG emissions [40] % by [2031] from a [2018] base-year."
This target was set with the expectation that Telstra would seek formal alignment with the SBT 1.5 degree pathway. Telstra anticipates that it will have an SBTi approved target covering scopes 1-3 by the end of 2021.
"Since climate change is such an urgent issue, while we work to achieve our 2025 and 2040 commitments, Takeda has also pledged to go beyond its Science Based Targets and be carbon neutral across its value chain (Scopes 1, 2 and 3) beginning with FY2019 GHG emissions through the use of renewable energy and verified carbon offsets on an ongoing basis.  We plan to achieve carbon neutrality every year going forward, therefore this goal needs to be achieved every year."
"In 2014, Korean government established a roadmap to achieve the national GHG reduction and by 2015, the government implemented the emission trading system, and submitted Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDC); 37% reduction from expected emissions in 2015 and in 2030. NHIS also targets to reduce GHG emission by 37% from expected emissions in 2015 and in 2030, which is the same as the Korean government target."
During the base year of 2018 we produced 0.72 metric tons of CO2  from the use of Furnace Oil. During reporting year we did not use furnace oil as source of fuel for Boilers at all and  CO2 emissions are zero for the reporting year starting from 1 Jan 2020 to 31 December 2020.
"The total kilometers covered air travel and are reported by our travel agency. Currently, the Bank does not count the total number of road business.Scope 3: Air Travel and paper consumption: 345 Tons of CO2eq For scope 3 in 2020, Air travels increased by 25 %, mainly due to training sessions held abroad, while paper consumption emissions were reduced in 3 %. In general, emissions in this scope increased by 20.4 %.For calculating our carbon footprint Scope 3 we consider the number of kilometers traveled by air travel: 240.87 Tons of CO2eq correspond to 70% of scope 3, and paper consumption:   104.3 Tons of CO2eq  correspond to 30% of scope 3.The Carbon Footprint report for national coverage 2020(Jan-Dec) included administrative buildings and all service offices nationwide through the implementation of the Greenhouse gases Protocol methodology and guidelines - Corporate Accountability and Reporting Standard (revised edition) in Davivienda facilities and processes. Coverage:The percentage of coverage is 100% because the calculation includes the air travel from all Administrative Buildings and Service Offices in Colombia.We are aligned with the commitments made by Colombia to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in accordance with the guidelines of COP 21. Colombia committed to reduce 20% of its greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 from an inertial scenario (business as usual).In 2016, we inclued the emissions from the use of paper. There was an increase in emissions of scope 3 becouse this parameter. We considered change the base year to 2016 fot scope 3 according with this inclussion. The global situation during the year allowed us to accelerate the digitalization and technological development of different processes. In environmental terms, this resulted in a 38%reduction of emissions derived from paper usage and a 78% reduction of the carbon footprint derived from air travel, generating a total reduction of 73% in scope 3."
"Our ambitions 2025 translate into a reduction in absolute reduction in emissions by 24.14% considering a baseline year of 2014. Our 2020 CO2 emissions of  122,952 tons corresponds to a 176.3% achievement level of this target. This target covers our Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 (business travel)."
"This is a global target which is included in the Corporate Social Sustainability Strategic Plan 2019-2023. It is focused on the reduction of the absolute emissions from scope 1 and 2 of Abengoa's GHG Inventory in a 5% using the base of 2017. With this target, Abengoa expects to reduce an accumulated amount of 103532 tCO2eq by the year 2023. The target has been achieved, due to the fact that Abengoa has reduced around 286700 tCO2 in the first two years, more than 100% of the whole target. Two consideratios: 1) A3T plant emissions are excluded from the analysis, since it is out of the perimeter since Dec 2020 ans 2) emissions from bioethanol process (biomass emissions), are incorporated in Abengoa's scope 1 figure. The target Abs1 is going to be reconfigured prior the end of 2021, in order to be more ambitious in terms of emission reductions. It has not been carried out yet because the organization is under a heavy restructuring process and the perimeter can change significantly. This absolute target is directly connected to the intensity target ‘Int1'."
"In May 2021, we have set a GHG emissions reduction target for fiscal year 2030 that is over the 1.5°C target covered under the Paris Agreement taking a long-range perspective.We are aiming to100% reduction of GHG emissions by FY2040 compared to FY2019."
"QTS develops, owns and operated massive data centers around the world.  The typical process for any data center company when developing these massive, expensive, critical operation facilities is to start from zero, and build everything new.  And QTS does this with many of our development projects.  But four of them - Atlanta, Dallas, Chicago, and Richmond, VA were massive structures that were originally built for something else.  Atlanta was a huge Sears and Roebuck distribution center.  Dallas and Richmond were old semiconductor plants, and Chicago was the Chicago sun times printing facility.  As the times changed, these structures were no longer useful for their intended purpose.  Most data center companies would choose to scrape that building off the ground and start fresh.  But QTS took the step of refreshing these structures and turning them into some of the most advanced and energy efficient buildings in the world.   So far we have saved 628,000 MWH of electricity in those four markets from not having to reproduce the steel and concrete. And we have saved 538,000 gallons of diesel fuel from being burned from hauling that material to the landfill.  By 2050 these facilities will be 100% full and we will have saved all of the steel and concrete that would have had to be reproduced."
"This is an intermediate targets set up for 2023 on the scope 1&2 emissions of EDF group. In accordance with SBTI guidance for the electric sector (""Setting 1.5°C aligned science based targets – quick start guide for electric utilities”, CDP, June 2020), the target on scope 1&2 emissions covers also the scope 1&2 emissions from the non consolidated assets (category 11 of the scope 3) and the emissions associated with the electricity purchased and sold to end users (category 11 of the scope 3, excluding T&D loss & obligations).It has been set considering a linear emission reduction between 2017 (SBTi reference year)  and 2030 SBTI emission target.Partially because of the COVID-19, EDF group is in advance in 2020 to achieve its 2023 intermediate emission reduction targets."
"The GHG reduction target is a science-based target approved by the SBTi, and are aligned with a well-below 2oC pathway. The target is an absolute target, where 100 % of emissions in scope 1 and 2 is covered. This is the mid-term target ending in 2030, which is between 2020 and 2035. The average annual reduction of scope 1 and 2 emissions is 6.0% from the base year 2009."
"An original goal was set in 2010, aiming to reduce the company's global carbon dioxide emissions from manufacturing operations by 30 percent per vehicle produced by 2025. Ford achieved that goal in 2017, eight years ahead of schedule. A new goal has been developed using science-based methodology and 2DS.  With 2017 as the baseline year, our goal of 100% renewable scope 2 energy at manufacturing locations gives us 75% reduction in scope 1+scope 2 absolute tCO2e by 2035.  We plan on submitting targets for Scope 1, 2, and 3 (use of sold products) for SBTi approval within 2 years.  Ford intends to establish targets and metrics for select suppliers starting in early 2021.Progress: ABSOLUTE TARGET 4 is a 75% reduction in Scope 1+Scope 2(location-based) between 2017 and 2035.  The 2017 base year emissions are 4,168,442 t CO2e. 75% of 4,168,442 is 3,126,332 tCO2e reduction required by 2035.In 2019 our S1+S2(loc) emissions are 3,636,301 t CO2e, which is 4,168,442-3,636,301=532,141 t CO2e lower than 2017.  We have reduced 532,141 t out of the 3,126,332  t needed to meet the reduction target.  532,141/3,126,332 = 0.17=17% of the reduction target has been achieved."
"Despite the success of the previous target 2011-2020, the long-term target has been expanded to 2025 starting from the base year 2015. The aim remains the same, being for a reduction of 2% of our (scope 1+2+3) emissions in the period 2016 to 2025. This new target implies that we aim to reduce our 2015 emissions (5,324 ton) to 4,350 ton in 2025, being a reduction of 974 ton (18.3%). Through our membership at Platform for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF) - which consists of twelve Dutch financial institutions who have agreed to work together to jointly develop open source methodologies to measure the carbon footprint of their investments and loans - we are in the process of establishing a Science Based Target which includes scope 3 (our main impact scope) specifically tailored to the financial sector."
"ZF Friedrichshafen AG commits to reduce absolute Scope 1 & 2 GHG emissions 80% by 2030 from a 2019 base year.This new absolute reduction target, which was announced  in 2021, is an element of  ZF Climate Neutrality Strategy.The Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHG) sets an international standard to categorize direct and indirect sources of emissions. Climate neutral means that all processes, products and services will not increase the CO?e load in the atmosphere. Scopes 1 and 2 can be directly influenced by ZF, as Scope 1 includes direct emissions resulting from the combustion of fossil fuel in ZF's own production and Scope 2 involves emissions from purchased energy, e.g., electricity.Climate neutrality by 2040 is part of ZF Strategy ''Next Generation Mobility”. ZF conducts its ZF Climate Ambition Initiative for implementation of climate protection strategy in all company processes considering ESG requirements. In this context scope and recalculation processes were reviewed to meet future criteria on auditability.  This led to change in carbon accounting of one power plant. Therefore, numbers stated here are the latest and differ from data of ZF Sustainability Report 2020."
"Due to the Covid-19 global pandemic affecting the 2019 operational year we decided that a base year average of 2019 and 2020 is more appropriate for comparison. hence, the ""Covered emissions in base year"" relates to the average from both these years."
"We follow the India's INDC ""GHG Emission Reduction and Management Law"" in July 2015. in order to complete the 2030 National Independent Contribution  (INDC) and the 2050 target energy consumption intensity targets, corresponding corporate emission reduction targets are formulated to achieve 10% reduction in emission"

"HZL committed to reduce company-wide absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions 14% by 2026 from a 2016 base-year. This goal has been approved by the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) and is aligned to well below 2C pathway. The base year 2016 means FY 16-17 and same applies to current year as well. These targets were approved by SBTi in September 2018 for 100% mines and smelters owned by HZL.Our scope 1 + 2 (location based) emissions in FY 20-21 were 4796511 tCO2e, FY 19-20 were 4734643 tCO2e whereas for target setting year (FY18-19) were  4870000 tCO2e. The absolute emissions are on increasing trend since the base year and target setting year- 8.94% higher than in base year 2016, due to expansion activities and increase in production however, there is a reduction by 1.51 % from FY18-19. While we are taking several measures to reduce our carbon emissions, all the initiatives are in the initial stages of implementation. Bulk of the reduction in Scope 1 & Scope 2 will be seen in FY 2022-23 when these projects will be fully implemented. Also, we aim to achieve the SBTi target by investing in Renewable Energy infrastructure progressively by 2026."

"Reducing GHG emissions has clear business benefits to our suppliers and contributes to Cisco's long-term operational success. To drive progress, we have committed to a goal for suppliers to set public, absolute GHG emissions reduction targets, and a longer-term goal to reduce Cisco's absolute supply chain-related Scope 3 GHG emissions.Abs 3: Reduce Cisco supply chain-related Scope 3 GHG emissions by 30 percent absolute by FY30 (FY19 base year)Includes allocated emissions from Cisco's Tier 1 and Tier 2 manufacturing, component, and warehouse suppliers, and calculated emissions associated with transportation emissions managed and paid for by Cisco. Emissions are allocated based on Cisco's financial share of the supplier's reported global Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions. Transportation emissions will be reported as Upstream Transportation and Distribution according to GHG Protocol methodology because they are paid directly by Cisco.Due to the standard lag between when emissions occur at our suppliers and when they are reported to Cisco through CDP, we are reporting our FY19 baseline in this disclosure. Verified progress against this goal will not be available until our 2021 CSR report (when we have the data to calculate our FY20 results). This progress will be reported in the 2022 CDP disclosure.See section C6.5 to see more details on scope 3 methodology and the forecasted FY20 results for each upstream category included in this target.Please note that WSP verifies Cisco's emissions on an annual basis."
"The Abs 1 target is set for our operations in the Netherlands. In 2015, the Netherlands achieved its 2012-2015 emissions reduction goals previously set and updated its goals to 2020 to reflect a longer-term vision of continuous improvement (30% reduction compared against its 2010 baseline year for Scope 1 and 2 market based emissions). We consider this target as a science-based target as the operations has a yearly 2.72% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 (market-based emissions) which is more ambitious than the well-below 2D target for the absolute contraction for SBTi (2.5% yearly reduction). In 2016, Arcadis began assessing whether these rigorous goals aligned with science-based targets which is anticipated to continue into 2019.To date, the Netherlands achieved its goal, -48.8% reduction compared against its 2010 baseline year. The number 48,8% is taking into account an increase of 12,1% in scope 3 emissions due to measures that have been taken. E.g. one of the measures taken is promoting working from home. This results in an increase of the electricity usage at home, which falls under Arcadis' scope 3 emissions. This means that even though there is a Netto reduction in scope 2, there is still an increase in scope 3 emissions (12,1%). These effects have been taken into account when calculating the overall reduction.Please note our Dutch Organization is locally obliged to use conversion factors that are different from the dataset we use for Global. To keep reporting consistent with previous years, the target above is calculated using the Dutch -local- set of conversion factors (https://www.co2emissiefactoren.nl/). This will be updated with new targets set for 2030."

"Our Scope 3 target is currently being validated by the SBTi. It covers 100% of our scope 3 emissions, upstream and downstream."
This is the SBTi approved target underpinning our target to be Net Zero (all scopes) by 2030 - which can be seen in our target NZ1.
ROCKWOOL Group commits to reduce absolute scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 38% by 2034 from a 2019 base year. ROCKWOOL Group also commits to reduce absolute scope 3 emissions by 20% within the same timeframe. The targets covering greenhouse gas emissions from company operations (scopes 1 and 2) are consistent with reductions required to keep warming to Well-below 2°C.
"Reducing by 35% the total of Scope 1 and Scope 2 absolute GHG emission by 2030, with 2019 as baseline year. The target will be submitted for approval by SBTi to seek alignment with the ambition scenarios proposed by the initiative and we believe it will be aligned to the Well-Below 2.0?C scenario. The target was defined considering the absolute contraction approach and covers all BRF operations globally."
"This is an absolute target for Alten since 2018: -for 72% of its scope 1 and scope 2 (CSR perimeter), Alten commits to reduce its emissions by 16% by 2025 for the same perimeter (same entities and same activities in these entities) , compared tol 2018 baseline.  To achieve our target, we are implementing ambitious initiatives, which include:- amplify in our deployment of renewable energy in the group, starting with 17 entities in the following countries: France, Belgium, Netherlands, Italy, Spain, Sweden, Germany, Finland, Portugal, Maroc, India ,UK, USA. The progresses are followed every year thanks to CSR reporting - improve our vehicule fleet in 8 countries France, Belgium, Sweden, Netherlands, Italy, Spain, Germany, Switzerland- favor eco buildings, as we did when chosing the Edouard Vaillant and Vitrolles officeIn 2020, because of COVID-19 crisis, professional travel by car have been reduced dramatically, as well as energy consumption in buildings -because of compulsory home office. Then our emissions linked to energy consumption and vehicule fleet have decreased. This has lead ALTEN to meet its target in advance. However 2020 situation is not representative of normal business."
We are currently setting targets on a rolling basis and continue to do this going forward to drive year on year improvements in performance.  We plan to review this process and are considering setting a longer term target.
"Dixons Carphone's emissions reduction target, validated by the Science-Based Target initiatives commits the business to reduce absolute scope 3 GHG emissions from purchased goods and services by 50% by financial year the 2029/30 (1st May 2029-30th April 2030) from a financial year 2019/20 base year. The target is company-wide, covering all geographies and businesses of the Group. Purchased goods and services, along with Use of sold product emissions (see Abs3) represent 99.3% of our total Scope 3 emissions. These ambitious Group reduction targets will be achieved, but not exclusively, through transition to renewable energy and  low-carbon transportation, as well as working with suppliers through the EcoVadis Carbon Module reporting platform."
"The health crisis has considerably reduced our emissions, but we do not consider that we have reached our objectives, we want the reduction to be sustainable"
This target is company-wide and includes all relevant Scope 3 categories and was officially validated by the Science Based Targets initiative.
"This is our long-term target for decoupling GHG emissions from business growth across our full value chain, including emissions from our agricultural supply chain, which account for 75% of total emissions in our value chain. This is a science-based target that has been set in line with scientific recommendations for reducing global GHG emissions by 80% by 2050. However, it has not been approved by the Science-Based Targets Initiative due to the length of our timescale."
This scope applies to all of our electrical consumption from traditional sources of energy.
we use 3 generators in our plant and two boilers each capacity 10 TON and 16 Ton respectively.
"The absolute target of TSKB is to reduce average GHG emissions of 2012-2016 by 10% until the end of 2021. 2016 is defined as the base year as it is stated in reporting guidance since target has been based on average GHG emissions over 5 years period. Average GHG emissions (Scope 1+ Scope 2 + Scope 3(upstream)) of TSKB was 927.80 tons CO2e over 2012-2016. Target is to reduce to 835.02 tons over 2017-2021. In reporting year, total GHG emissions calculated as 578.5 tons/year which is drastically lower than the year before and this is due to Covid-19 Pandemic. This resulted in considerable decrease in 4 years average GHG emissions.  Thus, this made TSKB target as achieved.  However, the last 3 years (2017-2019) average was 846.33 tons CO2e which means 87.8% of the target was achieved at the end of the 2019 and it seems now it is beyond to achieve the target. Despite it seems like it was achieved, TSKB decided to track the same target in the next  year as it is since 2020 was a year that all the world locked down, struggled and worked from home.Science Based Targets initiative (SBTI) published a guideline for financial institutions on September 2020 and it is written that if you are a financial institution that have commitment to have SBT before, you will have 2 years to set your target. In reporting year after the guideline published by SBTi, TSKB evaluated emissions released due TSKB operations to reduce its contribution on climate change and target was keeping its contribution below 1.5°C. This study does not cover Scope-3 emissions and as well as emissions from portfolio. At the end of 2020, TSKB decided to extend evaluation beyond Scope 1 and 2 to Scope 3. It is aimed to collect relevant data from customers, evaluate the data and see where the biggest challenge is and the most potential effect can be created in terms of aligning portfolio to a well below 2-degree world."
This is the SBTi approved target underpinning our target to be Net Zero (all scopes) by 2030 - which can be seen in our target NZ1.

"This is a long-term target covering all of REMA 1000's Scope 1 and 2 emissions. The target was set in 2015, with 2013 emissions as base year. The annual reduction is -2,4 % from base year 2013, with a total reduction from 2013-2050 of 90 %."
"The Group has developed a Master Plan as a roadmap for achieving decarbonisation. The Master Plan details a decarbonisation schedule that defines short-, medium- and long-term targets for reducing the impact on the environment from both an operational and business standpoint (such as the target set for reducing emissions in relation to the Group's investments).One of the objectives indicated in the Master Plan is to achieve zero net emissions by 2050. Therefore, as a first step, in 2020, the Group has estimated the emissions of its portfolio, resulting in a total of 15,228,576.56 tonnes of CO2.  Therefore, and in response to the lines set out in the plan itself, the Group has set itself the objective of reducing emissions by 15% by 2030 as a preliminary step to achieving zero emissions in 2050. It should be noted that the target is new as a result of the Master Plan established by the Group and covers the entire portfolio. Also, the Group has recently committed to the Science Based Targets initiative and is progressing in setting targets for its validation."
"This is a long-term science-based target. For a science-based target, the minimum reduction required is 49% absolute emissions reduction from 2010 to 2050. This translates to a linear 1.23% reduction per year on average (-49%/40 years = -1.23%/year) or a 1.7% compounded year-on-year reduction rate.  This target is consistent with the minimum reduction requirements by 2050.  Trinseo began work on this target in 2018."
The target at 2023 was calculated assuming the following scope of activity:? Reduction of mileage of private cars of employees by service due to smart working and new company policies (-327 Ton CO2 eq).
"The Abs3 target applies to emission from construction sites of our building construction and civil engineering businesses.We have been certified an Eco-First company by the Minister of the Environment as an advanced company in terms of environment protection measures. We made a promise of CO2 reduction targets with the Minister of the Environment as the Eco-First promises in 2010 by setting 2020 as a target year for emission in construction sites in our entire group. The target set for 2020 was already achieved, so in 2017 we updated our Eco-First promises with new target years of 2030 and 2050."
"After exceeding its previously set science-based target, News Corp has raised its ambition and has committed to a science-based target (aligned to 1.5 degrees C) to reduce absolute Scopes 1 & 2 GHG emissions 60% by FY 2030 from a FY 2016 base year. We also have signed and committed to the Business Ambition for 1.5C pledge to be net zero emissions by 2050."
"In early 2021, SNC-Lavalin released its targets and objectives set to reach Net Zero carbon emissions by 2030 (Please see our publicly available document at: https://www.snclavalin.com/~/media/Files/S/SNC-Lavalin/download-centre/en/policy/net-zero-carbon-routemap.pdf)As stated in this document, SNC-Lavalin will be driving down its scope 3 emissions via new policies to manage business travel, rationalizing office spaces and taking advantage of third parties' efforts to decarbonize or lower the emission intensity of aviation fuels. It is forecasted that, by 2030, these combined initiatives and circumstances will lead to the reduction of about 34% of our scope 3 emissions compared to the 2019 base year. These reductions will be equivalent to avoiding emitting more than 19,000 tons of CO2 per year compared to the status quo.SNC-Lavalin's scope 3 emissions include first and foremost business travel-related emissions, but also emissions associated with offices (upstream leases), where the Company does not have operational control of HVAC systems.Although SNC-Lavalin seemingly have already achieved its target for scope 3, we did not change the status of the target  to ""completed"" as we cannot exclude that scope 3 emissions will go up again once the covid-19 pandemic is over and business travel resumes."
"Target ambition: Mobimo has defined an emission reduction path by 2050, including 2 scenarios. The first, basic Scope 1 and 2 reduction-scenario is aligned with a global temperature increase well-below 2°C, the second scenario is 1.5 C-aligned. Premise/Normalization: The reduction has been calculated based on the same asset size as in 2011: 401'392 m2.Since then the asset has increased by 55.5% to 624'113 m2 in 2020 . The calculation basis is the emissions intensity (Scope 1 and Scope 2, location based) of 18 kgCO2eq/m2 in 2020 x 401'392m2= 7'225 tCO2eq. Emissions in 2011: 13'931 tCO2e; The target emissions intensity by 2025 is equal/less 13.6 kgCO?eq/m² (Total 5'459 tCO2e/same asset size as by 2011). The realized important reduction is due to an important improvement of the quality of the asset. With an emissions intensity of 18  kgCO?eq/m² (Scope 1 and Scope 2, location based), the reduction target for 2020 is achieved."
"In 2020, the Science Based Target Initiative (SBTi) confirmed our commitment to set science-based GHG emission reduction targets. Using the well-below 2°C scenario, we have set a 2035 target to reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions of 40% compared to a 2018 baseline. This target is exclusive of any offsets - nature based or any other form of carbon credits and is still pending SBTi approval. We consider this to be a science-based target as it was calculated using the SBTi tool version 1.2.  We have qualified our target status as underway given that we believe the downturn in the oil and gas industry resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic depressed operations and thus has resulted in significantly lower emissions than would have been anticipated under normal industry conditions.   It is anticipated that the emissions volume will increase in 2021 due to increased activity for 2021 and beyond, however we are implementing many initiatives to ensure our footprint remains on a downward trajectory to the 40% Scope 1 and 2 reduction by 2035.  The data disclosed here is different from that disclosed in our 2020 Annual and Sustainability Report (ASR).  The updates include additional data made available since the release and continued progress made in our data collation and validation processes. These will be reflected in the 2021 ASR data tables."
This is a Net Zero target for scopes 1 ans 2 by 2035 and may be achieved by using up to 20% offsetting

Fuel combustion resulted from staff travelling to and from project sites. Shipment of goods (diesel and NGV).  Scope 2 emissions: The Company's delivery of customer services at branches such as electricity use.Scope 3 emissions: The Company's distribution of goods such as transporting goods from Distribution Center to branches. Water and LPG consumption in the staff cafeteria."
"In June 2020, DTE  announced a net zero goal for its gas utility that includes Scope 1 emissions from its direct operations, and upstream and downstream Scope 3 goals.  .  The holistic three-fold approach will require natural gas suppliers to operate at net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050; DTE Gas operations, both combustion and fugitive emissions, will also achieve net zero by 2050; and partnerships with customers on energy efficiency and voluntary offsets will reduce their emission by approximately 35% by 2050.  In 2020, Scope 3 emissions from customer use of natural gas  was about 20 percent above our estimated 2005 baseline.  The emissions from customer use of natural gas are as reported to EPA under 40 CFR 9 Subpart NN.  Note that year to year emissions are weather dependent and may be above or below the baseline since natural gas is the dominant space heating fuel in Michigan."
Oracle self-assessed this target to be a mid-term science-based target.
SCREEN commits to reduce absolute scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions 30% by 2030 from a 2018 base year. The targets covering greenhouse gas emissions from SCREEN Group's operations (scopes 1 and 2) are consistent with reductions required to keep warming to well-below 2°C.
"This long-term target is for total GHG emissions of Scope 1, 2 for our global sites, aiming to achieve zero emission by FY2050. Though this target is not officially announced yet and not certified by the SBT initiative, we recognize that it is based on 1.5 ? scenario and SBT standard."
"The absolute target in this row only covers our operations in the Beverages Division.The target covers material emissions in the value chain of our four markets' operation (CN, HK, TW, USA)- Scope 3 includes, for example, emission from ingredients and packaging materials processing, cold drink equipment electricity consumption and product end-of-life.- Scope 3 accounted for 89.3% of total emission in base year- Targets for scope 1 and 2 emissions cover 96% of the Swire Coca-Cola's inventory- The Swire Coca Cola's scope 3 target covers 83% scope 3 emissionsThe covered emissions in the reporting year covers Swire Coca-Cola's Scope 1 & Scope 2 emissions and water-use related emission from Scope 3.  Scope 3 emissions relating to ingredient and packaging material processing, cold drink equipment electricity consumption were not included in the reported data. Swire Coca-Cola is working to gather the other scope 3 emissions data during the time of submission."
"Since 2016, FCFC has set targets in accordance to the INDC of Taiwan which is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 to 20% lower of the GHG emission in the base year of 2005. In 2020, FCFC has set long-term target of reducing GHG emissions by 2050 to 50% lower of the GHG emission in the base year of 2005. Utilizing the energy- and water-saving schemes available in the plant, FCFC divides its energy-saving processes into 12 categories, including ''wastewater recovery/water consumption reduction”, ''rainwater storage and utilization”, ''improvement of cooling water and refrigeration systems”, ''optimization of distillation towers"", ""high and low-end energy recovery"", ""improvement of steam piping systems, equipment insulation and decanters"", ""improvement of combustion equipment (including pumps, windmills, compressors, mixers), delivery systems and air compressor"", ""improvement of power and lighting systems"", ""recycling and improvement of Flare systems"", and ""process and equipment upgrades (for energy efficiency improvement).""From 2000 to 2020, the number of improvement cases has been accumulated to a total of 5,297 cases, and the investment amount reaches NT$ 12.876 billion,  and the accumulated benefit is NT$ 11.13 billion. Since FCFC has currently started to promote product transition, the production lines of Changhua Plant have been ceased and production lines in some plants have been adjusted. The GHG emission in 2020 was 0.01% higher than that of 2019, which was considered as about the same, mainly due to the less than optimal production capacity in 2020. The GHG emission was 9.7% lower when compared to that of the base year in 2005 with a target achievement rate of 19.4%."
"We have set a target to reduce our carbon emissions across our entire value chain by 20% by 2025, set against a 2016 baseline incorporating 100% of MillerCoors emissions. As of 2020 we have reduced absolute scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions by 22.5% (from 6,863,386 tCO2e to 5,275,304 tCO2e). Molson Coors value chain emissions reduction target meets the Science-Based Targets Initiative's criteria for ambitious value chain goals, meaning we are in line with current best practice and in line with what the latest climate science says is needed to meet the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement."
"Due to a proactive approach to switching to renewable electricity contracts combined with investments in solar panels in several locations, we are well underway in reaching our 2030 goals for 63% reduction of CO2 emissions from direct operations.  In 2020 we decided to adjust our targets to align with the 1.5 degrees scenario in line with various commitments we made and coalitions we joined, so this target has been revised to 63% reduction instead of the previous 38% reduction. 2020 emissions showed a 25.0% reduction compared to 2015 base year emissions, amounting to achieving 39.7% of the total 2030 reduction goal for this target."
"In 2020, Atresmedia has renewed the contracts that it manages directly with the electricity supply company by changing to 100% renewable energy, except for a small part of the consumption, which is included in those supplies that it cannot manage as it is not the titleholder (premises leased for Onda Cero Radio offices). Likewise, in December 2020, the fleet of Antena 3 and La Sexta News mobile units was renewed, a large part of which were converted to electric vehicles, which has meant that 71% of the fleet is now in the ECO-CERO category."
"To achieve the highest impact on the thyssenkrupp carbon footprint, to further expand business opportunities and to reduce risks our program Climate Action Program for Sustainable Solutions (CAPS) focuses on three pillars #IMPLEMENT existing solutions, #ENABLE our customers and #ENGAGE stakeholders. Since 2018, we have been working on defining accompanying long and mid-term GHG reduction targets in line with the Paris Agreement and most recent climate science. thyssenkrupp strives to become climate neutral by 2050 in its own operations (scope 1 & 2) and the whole value chain (scope 3).We have also committed ourselves to the following mid-term targets, which have been approved by the SBTi:#ENABLE: thyssenkrupp commits to reduce 16% of its scope 3 GHG emissions from the use phase by 2030 compared to base year 2017. The pillar #ENABLE focuses on ways in which our products, technologies & solutions can support our customers on their way towards climate neutrality. As a vast majority of our scope 3 emissions stems from the use phase of our products, we strive to develop & implement climate-friendly solutions for our most GHG intensive customer sectors especially cement & steel. In both sectors, the application potential for our innovative CCU solutions (such as C2C & Oxyfuel) is significant. They enable our customers to reduce emissions by capturing CO2 from CO2-intensive processes & using it for the production of base chemicals, thereby replacing fossil feedstock. Furthermore, our solutions contribute to the required transformation towards an economy powered to a high extent by renewable energy carriers like hydrogen. With our technologies such as water electrolysis, we contribute to renewable power generation and storage. It is by these measures, backed by cross-Group R&D activities, that we seek to decrease our scope 3 emissions by 16% until 2030.Note: Covered emissions in reporting year is already below target due to the impact of the pandemic on the economic environment. For this reason, the target status is still underway."
Target is for stable Centers.  Stable Centers include 24 sites in operations from 2019 to 2016 with no or minimal renovations.
"In 2017, we embarked on a plan to achieve carbon neutrality or net-zero emissions by 2022 in all our commercial assets (malls, offices, hotels).  We intend to achieve net zero emissions through a combination of approaches:(1) Avoid – incorporating passive-cooling design in our developments(2) Reduce – investing in energy-efficient equipment technologies (3) Shift –sourcing clean energy for our properties through power purchase agreements(4) Enhance – protecting and enhancing carbon forests through assisted natural regeneration (ANR)We focused on achieving net-zero emissions on our commercial properties because these represent 81% of Scope 1 and Scope 2 of Ayala Land Group's total emissions.  As of 2020, we have 57  buildings with renewable energy sources, reducing Scope 2 emissions by  154,403  t-CO2e. We have also managed and enhanced 586 hectares of carbon forests with a total measured carbon stock of  84,289  t-CO2e. These combined efforts in 2020 have reduced our Scope 1 and 2 net GHG emissions by  238,693  t-CO2e or by 91%."
"Trimble started the process of setting a science-based target in 2020  with 2019 as a base year given the irregularities of our 2020 inventory due to COVID-19.  Our target has been developed and is being submitted to the SBTi for approval this month (July/2021) though approval may not be received by the time this disclosure is submitted.  The target reported above to reduce Scope 1 + 2 (market based) emissions 50% by 2030 from a 2019 base year is part of our overall target covering scopes 1, 2, and 3 and in alignment with 1.5? ambition."
Black & Veatch is committed to reducing our GHG emissions and be net zero for overall emissions by 2025 from a 2019 baseline.
"Constantia Flexibles commits to reduce absolute scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions 24% by 2030 and 49% by 2050 from a 2015 base-year, approved by the Science Based Targets initiative."
"In 2020,  the target was to reduce ozone-depleting substances which are used for equipment operation by 5,5% relative to 2019. The target was achieved and the reduce was 6%.  Comment: we don't calculate values in metric tons/CO2, we use tons/year."
"This target is company-wide. This target is an interim goal in our roadmap to be net zero before 2040:In early 2021 we committed to The Climate Pledge to be net zero by 2040, ahead of the Paris Agreement's goal of 2050. To achieve this, we have set an interim target aligned with the pathway to limit global warming to 1.5 deg C above pre-industrial levels. This is known as a Science Based Target and has been approved by the NGO collaborative known as the Science Based Target Initiative as being aligned with the science. Specifically, our target is to reduce absolute emissions from our operations (Scopes 1 & 2) by 55 percent and reduce absolute emissions from the use of sold products by 16 percent by 2030 from a 2017 baseline. Further, in 2018 Johnson Controls set 2025 targets for energy and emissions reductions as part of a new Sustainability Strategy. The targets are to reduce operational Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas intensity and energy intensity, normalized to revenue, by 25 percent by 2025 from a 2017 baseline. Our path to zero is first based on achieving our interim targets which we will do by focusing on four key areas: energy efficiency, renewables, electrification of our fleet, and refrigerant management and transition. Emissions from energy, fleet and fugitive refrigerant emissions are each about 30 percent of total Scope 1 and 2 emissions. This year, 2021, annual targets associated with our 2025 Sustainability Strategy are embedded in Enterprise Leadership scorecards, with annual targets for energy and emissions intensity and absolute reduction in refrigerant emissions on the CEO scorecard and tied to compensation. From 2022 through 2030 the CEO scorecard KPIs will be linked to the 2030 targets, including emissions from the use of sold products, absolute scope 1 and 2 emissions and our commitment to double energy productivity."

"Encourage employees to use public transportation instead of private cars. We plan to reduce emissions by 5% total for the next 4 years. On September 22, 2017, the Board took the lead in organizing car-free day activities within our company to guide more employees to pay attention to and choose low-energy, low-pollution and low-emission transportation modes. Advocate the concept of green ecological life. And organize employees to participate in the signing activities. This is the 4th year of implementation. We will formulate a new plan in 2021 and invite more employees to participate."

"In 2010, we established company-wide short and long-term energy and GHG reduction targets to drive GHG emissions reductions at our operations compared to business-as-usual practices. In 2016, building on the success of the first five years of our sustainability strategy the company established a second set of five year sustainability goals targeting 2020, including our goal to implement projects that reduce emissions by  275 kilotonnes (kt) of CO2e by 2020. We measure and quantify reductions on a project by project basis, following standard project accounting practices. Reduction projects also undergo an internal assurance process that scrutinizes the eligibility of projects to contribute to the Teck goals, as well as the quantification methods.  While this goal was set in 2015, as noted, the 2020 goal is a cumulative value of emission reduction projects implemented from 2011-2020, and is measured against business-as-usual performance. In order to accurately reflect our goal performance within the constraints of the CDP questionnaire, we have depicted a 2020 base year which reflects the business-as-usual emissions that would have occurred if emission reduction projects had not been implemented. The value entered in the ""Targeted reduction from base year"" field reflects the reduction required annually from that business-as-usual case. Going forward (i.e. post 2020), Teck has set an ambitious objective of achieving carbon neutrality across all its operations and activities by 2050.  Teck has also set the following short term Goals in early 2020: -Reduce the carbon intensity of our operations by 33% by 2030.-Procure 50% of our electricity demands in Chile from clean energy by 2025 and 100% by 2030.-Accelerate the adoption of zero-emissions alternatives for transportation by displacing the equivalent of 1,000 ICE vehicles by 2025."
GNI have developed and verified its carbon footprint across the whole organisation. GNI have committed to reducing this by 50% (intensity) across all streams by 2030. We have added an additional 11 items to our carbon footprint database in 2021 for the 2020 reporting timeframe.  GNI completed a materiality assessment of our emission profile and from the results have added 10 items to scope 3 and one additional item to scope 1. GNIs carbon footprint now covers 23 elements of the core business and was considered extremely comprehensive from peer review. We are in the process of developing science based targets with progress being delayed by the development  and publication of industry specific guidance for the oil and gas sector.
"In late 2020, Dana announced a GHG reduction target of 50% by 2035.  This year we pulled the target date forward by 5 years to 2030 and have signed/submitted the SBTi commitment letter.  The new goal and target is in line with a 4.2% annual reduction which aligns with 1.5C strategy."
KBN's minimum 50 % reduction in its emission + net zero goal is aligned with the well-below 2°C target
"Target coverage : 100% of Bouygues Immobilier' Scope 3 emissions which represents 4% of the Group's Scope 3 emissions in 2020.Each business has established its climate roadmap using two scenarios, the focal points of which have varied from one business to another depending on their activities. These scenarios are based on the work of the IEA (International Energy Agency) and were carried out with the Carbone 4 firm.- Two types of 1.5 ° C scenarios leading to a low-carbon society have been developed:o The first so-called ""Pro-techno"" scenario estimates that the socio-environmental transition is based mainly on technological innovation which makes it possible to maintain GDP growth while significantly reducing environmental impacts (decoupling).o The second scenario called ''Sobriety” considers that the socio-environmental transition is based on resilience and societal changes by adopting new objectives of prosperity and social growth.- The scenario analysis exercise then consisted in projecting the current activities of each Business Line in these low-carbon transformation scenarios and identifying how the transformation of the ''business playground” induced by the scenario positively affected or negatively the activities of the Trade.- The risks and opportunities were thus identified, making it possible to understand the resilience of the current strategy of each Business Line in contrasting contexts of low-carbon transformation of the economy.Reduction projections were made based on climate scenarios and trajectories to set the level of ambition of the efforts to be made by the businesses. In that respect, the scenarios were chosen based on factor 4 considering a medium-term time horizon at 2030 and a long-term time horizon at 2050 as it is in line with the climate commitments of the public and private sector, namely that it is set on a path to limit global warming to 2/1,5°C.This analysis helped to set objectives:- Bouygues Telecom 2030: -30% Scope 3a & 3b, i.e. 3% annual reduction rate over target period, which is aligned with the well-below 2°C pathway"
"Convert lighting at 9 facilities to LED lighting. Square footage of facility areas to be converted to LED lighting will be:  225,000 square feet in 2017 and 2018,  an additional 21,000 square feet in 2019, and an additional 103,000 square feet in 2020 for a total area conversion of 350,000 square feet by end of 2020.  The LED lighting is projected to reduce Scope 2 CO2e emissions by 350 metric tons."
"Essa meta é ""ano rolante"" Todo ano deve reduzir 6% em relação ao ano anterior.O ano de 2020 foi marcado pela contínua busca por eficiência e inteligência no uso de nossos recursos e otimização da gestão dos nossos processos. Tendo em vista que os resíduos (Escopo I) constituem a principal fonte de emissões da Light Energia, destacamos o início da operação da área de compostagem de macrófitas que resultou na redução das emissões da Light SA no ano de 2020."
"Our 2017-2018 fleet Co2 emissions was estimated to be 160 metric tons. By retiring older fleet, replacing and reducing total number of new fleet and improving car pooling to job sites we reduced our Co2 by 36 metric tons. At our 2017 ""Management Review"" we set a 2018 Quality Objective to reduce our Co2 emissions for our fleet by 12 metric tons per year. In 2018 we reduced them by 10 tons and in our current year we reduced them by  another 24 tons( 22.5%)."
"Shipping accounts for 81 percent of our global energy use (and 40%+ of our total Scope 1 Emissions in 2020). Therefore we determined that in order to make  substantial reductions in our organizations greenhouse gas emissions, our vessel shipping was the most critical area to address. In 2018, we set the goal of reducing our emissions 10% by 2025 compared to our 2018 baseline consumption. To achieve this goal, we are upgrading our owned fleet to more fuel-efficient ships and optimizing our shipping routes. For many years, we've owned and operated a fleet of eleven ships that transport our products to North America from Central and South America. Now, these are being replaced with the six new full-container ships and we're estimating this will result in a savings of nearly 19 thousand metric tons of fuel each year. Two of these ships were launched in 2020, and the remaining four were launched in 2021.  Each vessel also meets the most stringent emission control regulation and includes:•An Integrated Condition Monitoring System in all the machinery and combustion engines in the vessel, the purpose of which is to continuously calculate and identify areas for efficiency improvements. •Alternate Marine Power (AMP), an anti-pollution method that stops the consumption of diesel fuel and minimize air pollution when the vessel halts at a port. •A new Hull design at the front of the ship, to increase speed, range, efficiency and stability. •Hybrid Exhaust Gas Scrubber system to reduce any harmful sulfur oxides that may be emitted from the exhaust gases. With the addition of our new fuel efficient vessels, we achieved this goal well before our deadline of 2025. Therefore, we determined it necessary to up our ambition, by setting our first ever company-wide target (outlined below). However, our work of reducing our emissions from our vessels is far from done. With our commitment to the Science Based Targets initiative in 2020, emissions reductions from vessel shipping will now fall under our broader company-wide goal of reducing our GHG emissions by 27.5% by 2030. Reducing our vessel emissions is a critical element of our climate action strategy."
"HZL committed to reduce absolute Scope 3 GHG emissions covering (purchased goods (e.g. cement, lime and soda ash, coal and inter-organization transportation of materials); business travel; and upstream and downstream transportation and distribution) 20% by 2026 from a 2016 base-year. The base year 2016 means FY 16-17 and same applies to start year as well. These targets were approved by SBTi in September 2018 for 100% mines and smelters owned by HZL.Our scope 3 emission for FY 20-21 is 4285442 tCO2e, FY 19-20 was 4187597 tCO2e whereas for target setting year FY 18-19 was 4244587 tCO2e.  The absolute Scope 3 emissions have increased by 0.96% from target setting year and by 2.45% from last year, due to increase in production by 7%, and subsequent increase in downstream transportation & distribution, processing of sold goods, and end of life treatment related emissions."
"Our new long-term goal was defined based on our joining the Banking Alliance's Net Zero initiative led by the industry and convened by the United Nations. This brings together more than 50 banks from 29 countries in order to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. This supports our importance and ambition that we have to be able to mitigate the environmental impacts of climate change and promote strategies for decarbonization throughout all the Group's aspects.  Moreover, we will be working on developing and aligning our short and mid-term targets based on SBTi methodology for financial institutions and this methodology."
"Data refers to the scope of the Group Environmental Management System, which includes around 60 offices and over 350 local agencies in Austria, France, Germany, Italy, Czech Republic, Spain, Switzerland, where 45% of Group personnel work. The monitoring of environmental performance related to mobility has a wider coverage and includes 65% of Group personnel. However, there is a plan to extend the reporting scope progressively in the coming years.The implementation of the current strategy focused on the decarbonization of the Group main offices, data centers and business travel made it possible to over-achieve the objective 2020 of a 20% cut in greenhouse gas emissions against the 2013 baseline. The net 2020 reduction is also due to the limitation of work travel and the low presence of staff in the offices due to the covid-19 pandemic.The target and the results achieved in 2020 are consistent with the methodology of the science-based target initiative, absolute contraction approach, aligned to a well-below 2°C trajectory, which requires for scope 1+2 GHG emissions an absolute reduction of at least a 2.5% per year, which is equivalent to a cumulative reduction of 15% over a 6-year period (2013-2019)."
"Pandora commits to becoming carbon neutral by 2025 across Scope 1 and 2. We plan to do this by purchasing no more than 5% carbon offsets. Therefore, it will be absolute reductions resulting from Pandora switching its operations to renewable energy. The targets is consistent with reductions required to keep warming to 1.5°C."
NOTE: This target is representative for the EMEA region ONLY- The reduction can be traced tracked to:---- In addition the  installation of LED lighting in 8 TECH EMEA sites between 2018 to 2020: THIS IS SIGNIFICANT IMPACT---- A number of AUTO EMEA sites closing betwee 2019 and 2020
"Zimmer Biomet set a company-wide science-based target for Scope 1 and 2, as well as Scope 3, to replace its previous target for its manufacturing facilities. Zimmer commits to reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions 55% by 2030 from a 2017 base year, and to reduce absolute Scope 3 GHG emissions from purchased goods and services 15% by 2030 from a 2019 base year. These targets were approved by the science-based targets committee in 2021."
"This is a company-wide target, that we made public in July 2019 by signing up to the United Nations' Business Ambition to 1.5°C and  relates to all locations and activities and commit us to be a Net Zero organisation by 2050 from a 2018 base year. The targets covering GHG emissions from company operations (scopes 1, 2 & 3) are consistent with reductions required to keep warming to 1.5 Degrees Celsius."
"As a manufacturer based in the small island of Mauritius, RT Knits feels very concerned about the climate change phenomenon. In December 2019, we became a signatory of the Fashion Industry Charter for Climate Action (under the auspices of UNFCCC) and committed to a collaborative approach to address the impacts of the fashion industry and support the world reaching climate neutrality by 2050. By supporting this initiative, we recognise the critical need to implement the Paris Agreement and accelerate the transformative change needed to win the race against climate change!As a signatory, RT Knits shares this ambition and commits to pursuing a target of 50% GHG emission reduction by 2030 and a commitment to analyse and set a decarbonisation pathway for the textile and fashion industry drawing on methodologies from the Science-Based Targets Initiative.In August 2020, RT Knits joined the Business Ambition for 1.5°C Campaign and officially committed to set science based targets to bring our emissions down in line with what the science tells us is needed.This commitment to science-based targets will enable RT Knits to continue developing goals, strategies and actions to tackle the challenges of climate change in the medium and long term and will subsequently lead us to a low carbon economy.We have established key priorities based on the energy pyramid to help us achieve these targets:Priority 1: Energy Conservation (Behavioural approach)                      a. Awareness and users' trainings                      b.  Good housekeepingPriority 2: Energy efficiency                        a. New investments and process innovation                        b. Infrastructural or equipment changes                         c. Preventive maintenance program                        d. Waste heat recovery and improved thermal systemsPriority 3: Renewable Energy                        a. Long term commitment to switch to 100% renewable energy                       b. 5 years plan for improved energy mix                       c. Prioritise clean energy for new investmentsTarget covers scope 1+2. It is based on the 50% absolute reduction of carbon emissions by 2030 based on 1.5? scenario."
"Initially defined on a pragmatic basis the target was did not fully factor in the potential impact of business developments and / or major changes that could result from improved efficiencies once undertaken, as they were not quantifiable at the time of setting.At the start of their journey, the company agreed to accept responsibility for the management and control of its climate-change impact, to set the target at a level perceived to permit growth and the inherent emissions impact of such growth whilst being achievable to promote company-wide engagement.This target cover all the company's Scope 1 emissions.It includes the fuel used for company vehicles not reported in early years of submission.As car fuel is now reported separately it now has an additional separate target; Abs4.It is now clear that the company underestimated its ability to achieve a significant and sustainable reduction in its absolute emission.This target is considered achieved, and having reached the end of the period defined for this target a review will be undertaken as to whether a more stringent target is now appropriate and viable particularly in the light of Paris Agreement 2015 and the recognition that all involved need to be targeting for below 1.5 degrees as a minimum.The current reporting year will form the base line for a future target.Unfortunately, it is yet not foreseeable how the company can translate this into to a Science Base Target as it is of perforce a simple target based on energy reduction and there remains too many imponderables such as the need of continual business development required to expand the currently available pool of RTE to meet customer demand and growth.With Science Base Targeting aimed at usage levels significantly in excess of the company's and for industries where the necessary metrics exist due to the greater impact that they have on climate-change.Therefore, though it remains a challenge to identify a model to permit the adoption of such a target this will not detract from consideration of this option.a"
Now keeping 2020 as a base year and by the addition of few other GHG sources to the inventory a new target of further 36% reduction in absolute emissions have been set for the year 2030.This is a company wide target for the operation boundary India and limited to Scope 1 & 2 emissions. Financial year 2019 – 20 is used as the basis for the emission inventory as base year.
"We believe that we cannot reduce our energy consumption any more here at our plant in New Jersey,  over the next two years but our  plan for Southeast Asia will hopefully start showing results in offsetting out carbon footprint starting in 2022."
"In 2016, La Banque Postale set up a target to reduce the CO2 emissions from energy use in its buildings. This target is aligned with the Bank's 2016-2022 strategic plan:-5% in 2017 (achieved)-10% in 2018 (target exceeded: -12% achieved)-15% in 2020 (achieved)-20% in 2020 (underway)La Banque Postale's CO2 emissions from buildings fell by 68% between 2013 and 2020.  In 2020, building emissions totaled 16 186 tCO2, a 7% decrease compared with 2019. This reduction was achieved thanks to the switch to renewable energy from 2016 on, and thanks to the energy management policy (ISO 50001)."
"When the target was initially set, it only covered Japan, and the percentage of emissions from the area covered by the target to the total amount of Scope 1 and 2 emissions in Japan was 100%. However, we entered the percentage for the boundary including overseas countries.  Our target value is that of emissions calculated by subtracting electricity and steam sold to other companies from Scope 1 and 2 emissions (assuming full-scale operation). The target value has been achieved in this report. However, emissions fluctuate due to economic factors, and we plan to continue with the current target until we set the next target."
"Target covers all scope 1 and 2 emissions as well as scope 3 emissions from business travel, paper, waste and water. We have followed the Science Based Target (SBT) methodology to the extent possible in setting this target, prior to the release of the financial services guidelines.  As our target was set prior to an available methodology it is not currently approved. Following the April 2021 release of an agreed methodology for financial services from the Science Based Target Initiative, we plan to work alongside our new parent company Intact and external consultants to review our target and ensure it remains in line with current science-based guidelines. The significant reduction in emissions in 2020 reflects in part the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on travel restrictions."
"To continually improve our impact, we fully reviewed our scope 1 & 2 targets and received Board approval for them in 2020 as part of our People & Planet Plan. We are now focused on an interim target to reduce our emissions 40% by 2034 towards our ambition to be net zero by 2045 (see NZ1). The target encompasses 100% of our global scope 1 and 2 emissions (normalised for divestment and acquisitions, based on operational control), and replaces our outgoing targets (Abs2, Abs3) which remained in place during 2020 whilst we reviewed our strategy. We will be moving to an operational control approach for all our wider reporting from 2021. The target tracks our progress as we transition to a lower carbon company and empowers us to innovate and trial new technologies that aid our ability to provide market-leading services and solutions for customers, while engaging colleagues on understanding and mitigating environmental impact. Reductions in emissions will be delivered via a variety of measures including our continued shift away from carbon-intensive assets towards providing customer-facing services and solutions. We will also continue to drive efficiencies across our operations, with savings arising from energy efficiency and low carbon measures such as solar, distributed generation, battery storage and LED installations alongside wider business efficiencies. Lastly, we will focus on driving down emissions from employee and fleet travel. To demonstrate leadership in this area, we signed up to EV100 to support the EV transition in 2019, ordered 3,000 electric vans with Vauxhall which is the largest commercial EV order of its kind in the UK during 20-21 and bought forward our ambition for our entire UK fleet to be electric by 2025. We have, however, been open and transparent that we do not yet have firm and grounded plans to deliver all of the emission reductions to achieve net zero but we have committed to develop and publish a Climate Transition Plan in 2021.While we consider our target to be science-based, we have continued our dialogue with the SBTi with a view to having it validated. Unfortunately, the delayed publication of the SBTi's oil & gas guidance that they believe will apply to Centrica has slowed the process, but we are exploring options to progress the commitment this year so that we can better meet stakeholder expectations."
"The target covers all our gross-global Scope1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions. This target has been set in line with the Well Below 2 Degrees Scenario. We target a reduction of 40.2 % from our gross-global Scope1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions, over a period of 18 years. This target is in line with our 1st Target of reducing our GHG emissions by 15% until 2025, which translates to a 2.50 % reduction per year on average. After 2025 we are aiming to reduce our GHG emissions by 2.1% per year, which makes up an extra 25.2% absolute reduction from 2019 levels. Both of these targets combined, we are aiming a total of 40.2% reduction over a period of 18 years.Although currently, our GHG emissions have increased by 2.97% compared to the base year of this target, keeping our investment plans in mind, we still believe we can reach this target until the target year."
"Electricity is used for the routine office's activities.To calculate emission for Scope 2 we have summed company's consumption and the emission factor by ISPRA.Energy (natural gas) is used for heating  offices.To calculate emission for Scope 1 we have used the  GHG Protocol sheet: ""Statitionary combustion tool"""
"In 2018, we set emission reduction goals that were aligned with strategies designed to address the long-term reduction of GHG emissions and our commitment to a leadership role in developing solutions that make technological and economic sense. The goals established in 2018 were to reduce GHG emissions by 50% (from 2007 levels) by 2030 and to achieve low-to-no GHG emissions by 2050. These are enterprise-wide goals that encompass the Scope 1 emissions from our electric and natural gas operations. In 2020, we revised our long-term goal to achieve net zero GHG emissions by 2050. The goals are informed by the results of our integrated resource plans, which are designed to plan for an appropriate mix of generation resources to meet energy and capacity needs at a reasonable cost for our customers. These goals are also consistent with actions needed to potentially limit the global average temperature rise to less than 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial times--see EPRI's ''Grounding Decisions: A scientific foundation for companies considering global climate scenarios and greenhouse gas goals” and ''Review of 1.5°C and Other Newer Global Emissions Scenarios: Insights for Company and Financial Climate Low-Carbon Transition Risk Assessment and Greenhouse Goal Setting” reports.  Southern Company will continue to use a portfolio approach as we seek to decarbonize. We expect our path to net zero to be comprised of several key elements: continued coal transition, utilization of natural gas to enable the fleet transition, further growth in our portfolio of zero-carbon resources, negative carbon solutions, enhanced energy efficiency initiatives, and continued investment in R&D focused on clean energy technologies. Our approach is driven by thoughtful scenario planning, long-term integrated resource plans, and constructive regulatory decision-making. We are also engaging with policymakers, customers, and other stakeholders to support outcomes that lead to a net zero future."
"DTE Energy led the industry in setting an aggressive mid-century target for our electric utility in 2017.  The 2017 carbon reduction commitment was 30 percent below 2005 levels by 2023, 45 percent by 2030, 75 percent by 2040, and more than 80 percent by 2050.  In 2019, DTE Electric accelerated this carbon reduction commitment in the Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) submitted to the Michigan Public Service Commission followed by a net zero commitment in September 2019.   The 2019 target is 32 percent below 2005 levels by 2023, 50 percent below by 2030, 80 percent below by 2040 and net zero (100 percent below) by 2050.Emissions in 2020  were 45 percent below 2005 levels.   Note that 2020 emissions were low due to reduced demand for generation and other factors caused by the coronavirus pandemic."
"This target currently covers the Scope 1,2 and 3 emissions we report on, on an annual basis and have direct operational control of. These are emissions from both our office estate and our business travel.Scope 3 supply chain emissions are covered by a separate engagement target. Homeworking will also be addressed in future works.COVID and the resultant lockdowns significantly impacted M&G's business travel emissions in the reporting year. So, although the calculation states M&G has achieved the target, this is not the case once business-as-usual resumes and business travel emissions increase again.  Having said this, M&G will endeavour to keep these emissions as low as practically possible to ensure it meets it's 2030 reduction  target."
We are underway on reducing carbon emission by promoting our suppliers to ship the materials by public transportation as often as possible and encouraging employees to ride bike if  they are not too distant from the company  and to take public transportation as often as possible.
"This target covers scope 1 and 2 emissions from owned and operated buildings, factories and fleet. In 2016 we submitted this target and it was approved by the Science Based Target initiative (SBTi) in 2017.In 2020, we achieved 55% reduction versus our 2010 baseline exceeding by 15% the target set (i.e., 40% reduction by 2030) and thus resulting in 137% achieved (55%/40%*100=137%). This achievement has been possible thanks to increased energy efficiency in our factories, on-site renewable investments, sourcing power from renewable resources and a program to reduce emissions in our vehicles fleet. Since the beginning of the pandemic, the priority has been to ensure the safety of our employees and their families. The company immediately activated the remote work policyand tools across our operations. With our people staying at home, energy consumption consequently dropped in the offices that stayed completely closed and increased in the facilities that stayed operational, with reduced capacity, due to the intensive operation of the ventilation systems; in total, our emissions from the offices dropped in 2020 by 31 percent versus 2019. In 2020, emissions from our fleet saw a great decline as well, of around 26 percent versus 2019, as an impact of the home office but also as a result of the lockdown measures implemented all over the globe and the lower number of kilometers driven by our employees, as well as our efficiency efforts.We consider the Covid-19 related reductions to be a temporary event, driven by an extraordinary emergency, the great majority of our carbon emission reductions has been achieved by dedicated projects in energy efficiency and switches to renewable energy between 2010-2020. This is what we consider to be a permanent result that we will continue to strive through implementation of our carbon reduction strategy."
This target to become reach net zero by 2045 is for the whole Skanska Group in covering all markets and businesses. The target also includes a mid-term target of a 50% reduction by 2030. This is included as Abs 2.

"The target covers scope 1+2 of the GIGABYTE Headquarters, Nanping Factory in Taiwan, and two factories in China. As mentioned above, the first reduction target of the Green Action Plan was reached ahead of the target year. Thus, we reset the goal in 2017 by cutting 50% emissions by 2030 compared to the 2009 level. Considering that the global attention on the extent of business ambition to cut emissions has kept rising, and various related initiatives and standards have been developed by creditable parties, in 2020, GIGABYTE decided to advance the target year from 2030 to 2025. Currently, we are moving on toward the new target, cutting 50% of emissions from the 2009 level by 2025.[Explanation of setting an SBT] GIGABYTE endeavours to reduce our negative impacts on the environment and have made effort to continue cutting the emissions generated from our operation. To ensure our emissions to be in line with or even below the emission level that aims to achieve the global 2°C goals, we tried to set a science-based target based on the methodologies and suggestions provided by SBTi. After researching, we decided to apply the Absolute Contraction Approach which is best applied to our situation to help us understand how much effort we will have to make in the strictest scenario. The result showed that if we continue to keep our emission reduction rate following the current 50% target, it will exceed the 2°C level after 2022. That means we need to either reset a stricter target or set up a new target after 2022. We are still working on this issue."
"In complying with the Bank's sustainability objectives and environmental commitment, in 2020 Davivienda measure and report the Carbon Footprint based on the Greenhouse gases Protocol methodology and guidelines - Corporate Accountability and Reporting Standard (revised edition) available in www.ghgprotocol.org.In agreement with these documents and the availability of information, it was decided that emissions calculations be carried out through the collection of information on levels of activity and further multiplication by an emission factor. The emissions and potential global warming factors used in the calculation, were taken from well-known sources.The emissions and potential global warming factors used in the calculation, were taken from well-known sources.The FECOC (Colombian fuel emission factors, for its Spanish acronym) used for the emissions calculations for the burning of fossil fuels. http://www.siame.gov.co/Portals/0/FECOCupme.xlsResult Carbon Footprint measurement 2020:Scope 1: Emissions due to consumption of cooling gases for air conditioners and fuels of electric plants 2,596 Tons of CO2eq Considering the higher average temperatures in Colombia during 2019, which generated greater demand of air conditioning and, thus, greater consumption of cooling gases, we increased by 1.63 % our emissions in this scope as compared to the previous year; notwithstanding, there was a 52.5 % reduction compared to the base year 2014.The Carbon Footprint report for national coverage 2020(Jan-Dec) included administrative buildings and all service offices nationwide through the implementation of the Greenhouse gases Protocol methodology and guidelines - Corporate Accountability and Reporting Standard (revised edition) in Davivienda facilities and processes. We are aligned with the commitments made by Colombia to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in accordance with the guidelines of COP 21. Colombia committed to reduce 20% of its greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 from an inertial scenario (business as usual)."
Dover Corporation committed to reduce absolute scope 1 and 2 market-based GHG emissions 30% by 2030 from a 2019 base year.
"From fiscal 2019, the Accounting Standard for Revenue Recognition (Accounting Standards Board of Japan Statement Number 29) was put into effect and as a result, calculation methods for Scope 3 of Category 1 were readjusted (fiscal 2019 values retroactively corrected). Category 1 emissions were 2.625 million t-CO2e, compared to 1.716 million t-C02e in fiscal 2019 and 1.731 million t-CO2e in fiscal 2020."
"Refers to sold-product use-phase emissions, which cover 80% of our total Scope 3 emissions. All emissions (100%) of the sold-product use-phase are covered. This target was submitted in 2017 and approved by SBTi in 2019.It was part of our original 2°C target. It was kept when improving  to 1.5°C targets. The target itself may not be aligned with neither new 2°C nor 1.5°C definitions. However, it has to counteract very strong ICT throughput growth (and therefore is a small but absolute target). In total, these emissions are also massively over compensated by the Greening-by-ICT climate-change mitigation potential."
"The scope 1 & 2 and scope 3  inbound logistic were calculated in the base year 2015.  2020,  we calculated additional scope 3 emission categories. To compare the reporting year with the base year we exclude these categories. We disclose them in another chapter of this questionnaire. The increase of emissions can be related to the expansion of shops and employees as well as the more detailed balancing of emissions in the reporting year. The target of 10 % is set to approach to the 30 % target of the United Nations Fashion Industry Charter which is still on our map for a successful emissions reduction."
"In 2018, Almirall set a new scope 1+2 (market-based) long-term target (target year 2025). Since 2013, all electricity purchased in Spain has been certified with Guarantee of Origin (GoO) and since 2018, also in Germany.  In 2020 Almirall has reached its target 5 years before than planned. Therefore in 2021 is working in establishing a new reduction target for 2030."

"This target was set in 2017 in the framework of the Strategy of Low-Carbon Development for the period until 2030.The target  was developed  for the main production site of Arkhangelsk PPM in the city of Novodvinsk. It's the largest business unit of APPM.In the base year (2015) GHG emissions (Scope 3) were 462,771 tCO2e. The Company's absolute target is 370,000 tCO2e by 2030. Thus, target reduction from base year = (462,771-370,000)/462,771*100=20.0%In 2020, GHG emissions (Scope 3) were 438,907 tCO2e. The reduction for the reporting year 2020 = (462,771-438,907)/462,771*100=5.2%Thus, % of target achieved = 5.2/20*100=25.8%"
"Our original 2015 science based target was expected to increase from 5642 tCO2e to 7598 tCO2e in 2020.   Since that time, we have expanded our collection of data to dive deeper into our data to eliminate some modelling.Starting in 2019 we are reporting targets with base year of 2018 for  5 and 7 years ending in 2023 and 2025 for 22 Mid-level ATC's instead of 6 ATC and reporting emission data obtained since 2017 for these locations.  This information has been updated in this year CDP disclosures.   To achieve the recommended reduction levels, Core Labs would need to set a target requiring a 45% reduction by 2030 from 2010 levels to stay under 1.5°C and reach net zero by 2050, using the IPCC special report published in October 2018. In comparison to 2018 emissions, Core Laboratories latest baseline year assessment, this equates to 12.5% reduction by 2023 for a ‘well below 2 degree' scenario (WB2C) and 21% for a 1.5 degree scenario (1.5C). Emissions for the 21 sites would need to decrease from 50,748 tCO2e to 44,405 tCO2e by 2023 under the WB2C scenarios and or to 40,091 tCO2e under the 1.5C scenario.  By 2025, reductions of 19% and 27% are required under the WB2C and 1.5C scenarios respectively from the baseline year of 2018.The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly reduced demand for our services, and has had, and is likely to continue to have, a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have resulted in a significant and swift reduction in international and U.S. economic activity.  The extent to which our operating and financial results will continue to be affected by COVID-19 will depend on various factors and consequences beyond our control, which will depend on numerous evolving factors and future developments that it is not able to predict.Any of those outcomes could have a material adverse effect on Core Lab's business, financial condition, results of operations  and cash flows and could perhaps amplify risk factors.  For these reasons while Core Lab has achieved our 2025 target at Well-below 2°C aligned 5 years ahead of the planned date we do not consider the goal achieved but rather still underway with not plans to set a new base year and goal.The information on targets and Trucost report files.  https://www.corelab.com/cr/environmental-focus"
"Target: 100 % renewable electricity by 2020. 99% of our base year Scope 2 emissions (2018) are from  purchased electricity. Our target to source 100 % renewable electricity is part of our wider carbon neutrality target. The target achievement is 99,3 % which we consider equal to 100 %. In 2020 METTLER TOLEDO conducted a climate-related scenario assessment together with a sustainability consultancy partner assessing the opportunity to target  carbon neutrality and how a more ambitious decarbonization pathway aligned with Science Based Targets (SBT) could look like for us. To assess potential targets we applied the ""Absolute Contraction Method"" and evaluated scenarios aligned with 2DS, IEA WB2DS and a 1,5 Degree scenario developed by the International Energy Agency (IEA) and compared it with business a as usual (BAU) scenario. Using 2018 as the baseline year the results concluded that our current emission reduction performance for Scope 1 and 2 is in line with a 1,5 degree trajectory. 2020 performance: 57 % reduction in Scope 1 & 2 emissions in compared to 2018, mainly due 100 % sourcing of renewable electricity for our global operations achieved in 2020. We have not yet committed to SBT but are using the scenario analysis to inform and guide our strategy."

"The absolute target established is: ''Reduce 25% of Duratex's direct emissions (Scope 1)” in relation to the base year (2012). It was developed in 2016, based on a review of Duratex's material themes that resulted in the company's Sustainability Strategy, to be started in 2017. This target covers Duratex's operations in Brazil, excluding the Ceramic Coatings business. In 2012, Duratex's participation in the capital of Tablemac (currently Duratex Colombia) went from 25% to 37%, and its emissions have not yet been accounted for, so the percentage of Scope emissions was 100% in the base year. In 2020, the operations contemplated in the target would represent 95.58% of direct emissions. Currently, the Strategy and its targets are under review, with the aim of establishing a science-based emission target. Considering the projections made at the time the milestones were drawn up, the emissions from Duratex's Brazilian operations in 2020, which include the Deca (Metals and Ceramics), Hydra and Wood (Forest and Panels) divisions, and being accounted for for the first time, Ceramic Coating , totaled 270,958.25 tCO2e, above the expected milestone for 2020 (203,218.69 tCO2e). The increase in the company's absolute emissions of approximately 9% was due to acquisitions and expansions in the Ceramic Coatings area. The expected evolution to reach the goal in 2025 was not linear, since variable production projections were considered.It is important to highlight that Duratex is revisiting its emissions targets, including for the Colombia and Ceramic Coating units. The expectation is to disclose the goals with a scientific basis in 2021, together with the Company's new Sustainability Strategy.  The goals are to reduce emissions and maintain a positive carbon balance within the business."
"Base year emissions covered by target (metric tons CO2e);25.6 . We want to reduce by 10(metric tons CO2e,But in fact we just reduced by 9.3(metric tons CO2e) . So we've done 93% of the emissions.9.3/10*100%=93%"
"In the reporting year we set our second generation, 1.5°C aligned SBTi-approved target to reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 market-based emissions 67.2% by 2030 over the 2014 base year. The SBT includes an absolute Scope 3 emissions target, aligned to the 2 °C to reduce emissions from purchased goods and services by 14% by 2030 over a 2019 base year."
"We are committed to reducing our greenhouse (GHG) emissions to help mitigate the effects of climate change. In early 2019, Iron Mountain's science-based target (SBT) was approved by the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi). Later in 2019, responding to calls from leading climate institutions, we voluntarily revised our SBT to align with a scenario well below 2°C. Using 2016 as a baseline, Iron Mountain committed to reduce absolute GHG emissions 25% (initially 20%) by 2025."
We have set the same level of target as SBT.

"At Assurant, we aim to identify, monitor and report our relevant energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and improve our energy and emissions intensity. At an operational level, we set a goal to reduce energy consumption by 20% by 2020 compared to a 2010 baseline. We achieved this goal in 2019, and we are currently in the process of developing a new emissions goal. In the interim, we have set a goal to continue to reduce scope 2 (location based) emissions by 2% per year."

"In the year 2016 we decided to purchase ""green"" electricity from renewable sources.  We plan  to purchase ""green"" electricity till 2022 but we would like to continue to do so also after the target year.In Scope 2 a change of methodology in calculation of emission occurred.  Not only direct emission but also WTT (well-to-tank) losses are calculated in this section. It is related to a change in the standard ISO 14064-1:2018. Thus a sum of Scope 2 emission is not zero as it was last year."
"In FY20, we established a science-based target to reduce our absolute GHG emissions by 30 percent by 2030, compared to 2020 levels. This target includes reducing emissions from our operations (Scope 1 and 2) by sourcing 100 percent renewable electricity and reducing emissions from our supply chain (scope 3). Our goal was approved by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), indicating that our ambitions align with reduction pathways to limit global temperature rise across the planet to 1.5°C.The goal is consistent with our commitment as a signatory to the UN Fashion Industry Charter for Climate Action to achieve a 30 percent aggregate GHG emission reductions in scope 1, 2, and 3 of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Standard by 2030, against a baseline of no earlier than 2015. The goal is also consistent with our membership in RE100. Setting a value chain carbon reduction target is a significant milestone for Ralph Lauren. We believe that companies must establish ambitious, science-based targets to ensure that society averts the disruptive effects of climate change. Our commitment represents our long-standing values, reflects the evolution of our thinking and will help decarbonize the fashion industry. We are in the process of implementing a detailed plan to achieve our goal by sourcing renewable energy for our operations and reducing the carbon intensity of raw materials, manufacturing, and production in our supply chain.Ralph Lauren's annual carbon footprints are aligned with our fiscal years. The baseline year of our science-based target is aligned with FY20, which ran from April 2019 to March 2020. However, the target language of the SBTi specifies 2030 as the target year. Due to our reporting cycle being misaligned with the reporting year, we're aiming to achieve our 2030 goal in our FY31 reporting, which will cover April 2030 to March 2031."

"This absolute CO2 emissions reduction target was set back in 2016 covering Scope 3 product use phase. Target was set only on Scope 3 product use phase due to the fact that product use phase stand for more than 80% of total Husqvarna Group's Scope 1, 2, 3 CO2 emissions.  In 2017 target was approved by Science-based targets initiative but target ambition was not aligned with any temperature ambition. Science-based targets initiative did not assess target ambition based on temperature in 2017. It was only in 2019 when Science-based targets initiative started to assess target ambition based on the temperature and only then target was assessed as being 2°C aligned. Nevertheless in 2020 we set a new absolute CO2 emissions reduction target that is more ambitious, covering larger scope and in line with 1.5°C. For that reason this target was retired in 2020."
We adjust 2045 target to 2040 to keep-up with Nationally Determined Contribution in Korea
"In the future (either concurrently or after we achieve our current 10% reduction goal), we intend to set ambitious GHG targets utilizing the Science Based Target Initiative methodology. This could be within the next 2-3 years. In addition, for all environmental metrics, including our GHG target, we apply the operational control boundary, except for our 50/50 joint-venture facility in China, in which we accounted for 100% of our production from that facility. This data represents our largest leased and owned manufacturing and warehouse facilities across the globe, representing approximately 85% of our real estate footprint in terms of square footage. We are in the process of improving our data collection processes to capture all facilities (for example, including offices) so that we may better monitor and provide a more complete picture of our impacts moving forward. We used the methodology outlined in the World Resource Institute (WRI) and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development's (WBCSD) GHG Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (Revised Edition) to calculate the Scope 1 and 2 emissions generated by our facilities. Through this assessment, we measured the GHG emissions associated with the natural gas, propane, and diesel fuels we utilize for heating and cooling our facilities and for our backup generators and forklifts (Scope 1 emissions). In addition, we measured the electricity we purchase to power our facilities (Scope 2 location-based method). GHG emissions are reported in metric tonnes of CO2e (tCO2e). Our energy consumption is limited to natural gas, diesel, propane, hydropower renewable energy, and electricity use."

"This target represents our annual absolute target for fiscal year 2021 as part of Autodesk's commitment to the trajectory of ANNUAL TARGETS set by our science based target methodology, the Corporate-Finance Approach to Climate-stabilizing Targets (C-FACT), through fiscal year 2021. The annual absolute target for this year was a further 2% reduction from the target for the prior year and is derived from the intensity target. A new annual target is derived each year, which translates to 45% reduction in fiscal year 2021. For more information, please see SBTi's C-FACT webpage. Autodesk has developed an approach that corporations can follow in setting targets to reduce GHG emissions. The approach calls for companies to reduce GHG emissions in line with global scientific and policy climate stabilization targets, and in proportion to companies' relative contribution to the economy, measured by gross domestic product (GDP). Autodesk has made this approach open source so that other companies can adopt and build upon it and it has been adopted by the SBTi.Please note Autodesk's 2021 fiscal year ran from February 1, 2020 through January 31, 2021."

Our strategy to achieve this target is via our ongoing sourcing of renewable electricity, reducing the carbon intensity of the fuels we use, switching to alternative technologies that enable low-carbon fuels, and via an enhanced travel policy favoring teleconferencing, lower carbon modes of travel and a flexible working policy. The targets were finalized in early 2020, in line with our commitment to the UN's Business Ambition for 1.5C. Base year Scope 3 GHG emissions were updated from previously published values due to improvement in data quality and calculations. The value was updated from 29,874 to 27,850 metric tons CO2e.In 2020, we achieved and exceeded our target to reduce Scope 3 emissions. We are conscious that a portion of this progress is attributed to reduced emissive activities due to the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent office closures, which significantly reduced business travel and employee commuting. We will work to maintain these emissions reductions by the target year in the post-Covid world."
"Grieg Seafood ASA commits to reduce absolute scope 1, 2, and 3 GHG emissions 35% by 2030 and 100% by 2050 from a 2018 base year. The targets covering greenhouse gas emissions from company operations (scopes 1 and 2) are consistent with reductions required to keep warming to Well-below 2°C."
"This is a mid-term target covering Sparebanken Vest's Scope 1 and 2, and categories Waste and Business Travel in Scope 3. The target was set in 2018, with 2018 market based emissions as base year emissions. The annual reduction is -8,2 % from base year 2018, with a target of reaching 100 tCO2e in 2025.  This target can be considered a Science Based Target as it meets the ambition requirement criteria in line with a 1,5 degree target set by the Science Based Target initiative (SBTi). Note: in SPV's previous communication of the target, location-based emissions in base year 2018 of 293 tCO2e have been used, but we have here switched to market based emissions of 233 tCO2e for consistent methodology."
"As part of our carbon neutral by 2025 target through offsets, we have set a goal of having 0 increase year on year for our scope 1+2 emissions.  In 2020, our scope 1+2 emissions totalled 163,641, or a 1% decrease vs 2019; thus, we have achieved our target of  0% increase."
"FirstRand has set targets for scope 1 and 2 emissions for the group's South African operations, based on science and aligned with the Paris Agreement goals. Targets adopted by companies for reducing carbon emissions are considered ''science based” if they are in line with the level of decarbonisation required to keep the global temperature increase below 2°C compared to pre-industrial levels. FirstRand chose to model data and set targets using an absolute emissions contraction methodology rather than a sectoral decarbonisation approach (based on the buildings sector) as it was considered more appropriate for the group's operations. The resulting targets are a 75% emissions reduction target for Scope 1 and 2 emissions for South African operations (i.e. those directly related to the group's operations) by the year 2050 (against a 2015 emissions baseline), with additional short and medium interim targets set to track progress."
"The goal has been set to reduce our fugitive methane emissions to 50% from our 2019 baseline by 2030. In 2020 these emissions represented 4.1% of IEnova's total GHG emissions. Although it does not represent a large amount for the total emissions of IEnova, this type of emission must be attended to adress a Mexican regulation that establishes the implementation of a plan to control and reduce methane emissions in the oil and gas sector for the country.The goal will be achieved primarily through  improving the efficiency of the pipelines segment which results in the reduction of fugitive methane emissions; and by improving fugitive emission review, detection, and repairing activities as part of the assets maintenance plan. We consider that we are going to reduce at least 6% per year starting with emissions from 2021  . The reduction will begin to be measured in 2021, mainly due to the fact that COVID did not allow us to directly measure in the field the reduction that could have occurred in 2020.We will report progress toward this new goal beginning in next year's sustainability report."
"We assume our 2018 purchases have been over estimated.Data collection has been made more precise in 2020. As the target is reached, we decide to close this targetHowever, ALTEN as implemented several actions in order to decrease its scope 3 emissions:With the signing of the Climate Engineering Charter at the end of 2019, ALTEN strengthened its commitment to promotingsustainable development, integrated at the heart of its strategy of development.The 2019-2022 purchasing policy and program ALTEN's Purchasing policy is carried out by the Purchasing Department Group. It is built around the following 5 axes of work:1. the business line, aimed at sharing and supporting the parties internal stakeholders in the formalization, application and monitoring of procurement process and best practices;2. the economic axis to guarantee the purchasing performance of the business;3. the quality and performance axis which measures and monitors performance its suppliers, partners and subcontractors;4. the business relationship axis, dedicated to integrity and sustainability supplier relationships while stimulating innovation and competition;5. the risk axis, relating to the control of risks whatever their nature: financial, societal, SSI, confidentiality, CSR, legal,ALTEN image, regulations and certifications.The Purchasing Department oversees the deployment of the program 2019-2022 purchases in synergy with the other Departments of the business. This program aims to continue to provide:l defining a specific steering strategy for the subjects priority;continuous improvement of the purchasing function across the Group.Since 2018 but also in 2019, several structuring projects were conducted for:-Update of the CSR evaluation of suppliersTransformation of management Information system for employee travel;.In 2019, the 1st Supplier Committee took place, bringing together 17 suppliers to make them aware of this approach and tohelp grow on this subject.In 2020, we revised our CSR questionnaire by intensifying the dialogue on climate with our suppliers"
"This target covers our company-wide scope 1 emissions which include natural gas, fugitive emissions, transport and heat  and was approved by the science-based target initiative. We are currently on track to achieving this target."
"Universal previously committed to setting a science based target and the target was approved by the initiative on July 9, 2021. The target includes all of our scope 1 and 2 emissions from our direct operations. A majority of the associated emissions are mobile and stationary combustion."
"In 2019, Kimball Electronics set company-wide goals to be achieved by the end of the year 2025.  One of our goals is to reduce our usage of electricity using KWH as the measurement. Our overall goal is an absolute number in that we want to reduce the amount of KWH we use. If we continue to reduce the amount of electrical energy we use, then this will have a major effect on our Green House Gas emissions.  In 2019 we used 65,084,563 KWH of electricity. In 2020, this was reduced to 63,020,939 KWH; a reduction of 3.17%."
"Starting in July 2012, Microsoft has had (and has achieved) a target to be carbon neutral every year from fiscal year (FY) 2013 onward. We achieved carbon neutrality in FY20 (the reporting period) through a combination of onsite renewable electricity generation, internal energy efficiency projects, and purchases of renewable electricity and carbon offsets. We understand that CDP guidance requests that companies not consider carbon offsets when reporting targets in C4.1. However, we have elected to report offsets to communicate these GHG emissions management activities; we have also reported additional targets that do not use offsets (see Abs1, Abs2, and Abs3). Note that the start, base, and target years reported are based on the Microsoft fiscal year. Our start year for this commitment is FY13—the first year in which we achieved carbon neutrality—and we committed to achieving carbon neutrality in all subsequent years. Because our commitment is ongoing and achieved annually, the base year (FY19) is the year prior to the target year (FY20, the reporting year). The FY19 base year emissions reported here are zero because we achieved our carbon neutral target in FY19. In FY20, Microsoft committed to shift our carbon-offsetting activity to accredited carbon removals, consistent with an emerging non-governmental organization (NGO) definition of net zero emissions. Additionally, in January 2020, Microsoft announced that, by 2030, we will become carbon negative, annually removing more emissions from the atmosphere than our total Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions combined, and by 2050, we will remove an equivalent amount of all the carbon dioxide the company has emitted either directly or by electrical consumption since it was founded in 1975. Our carbon negative commitment is covered by the net zero target (NZ1) reported in this response; as we make progress towards our net zero target, we will maintain our commitment to carbon neutrality."
"In 2015, the Carrefour Group made a commitment to reduce its store-related carbon footprint by 40% by 2025 (vs. 2010) and 70% by 2050. These targets were considered as SBT by the Group but were not validated by the initiative. Since 2019, this reduction is already of 39%, Carrefour is committed to going further by working together with its customers and suppliers to improve the way we produce and consume: more local, eco-designed, reducing packaging, more vegetable proteins... To achieve this, Carrefour is raising its ambition by setting itself new targets that were validated by the SBTi :For its stores (Scopes 1 and 2): Carrefour has set itself the target of cutting its greenhouse gas emissions by 30% between 2019 and 2030 and by 55% between 2019 and 2040.For scope 3 : purchased good and services : Carrefour has set itself the target of cutting its greenhouse gas emissions by 30% between 2019 and 2030 .For scope 3 : usage of sold products  : Carrefour has set itself the target of cutting its greenhouse gas emissions by 25% between 2019 and 2030 .These new objectives have been approved by the Science Based Target initiative (SBTi) led by the CDP, the Global Compact, the World Resources Institute (WRI) and the WWF®, confirming Carrefour's commitment to the Well-below 2°C scenario developed by the IPCC."
A first commitment of Legrand to reduce its scope 1 and scope 2  emissions has been validated by SBTi in June 2018.  A new 1.5° aligned commitment  has been assessed by SBTi in 2021. Communication is under process.
"We have set a target to reduce our carbon emissions across our direct operations by 50% by 2025, set against a 2016 baseline incorporating 100% of MillerCoors emissions.  As of 2020 we have reduced our absolute scope 1 and 2 emissions by 24.1%  (from 1,341,497tCO2e to 1,017,928 tCO2e ). In the summer of 2019, this target was officially approved by Science Based Targets Initiative as being consistent with the level of decarbonization required to keep average global temperature increases at 1.5°C  compared with pre-industrial levels, putting Molson Coors among the most ambitious businesses in the world on climate targets."
"Although figures this year show we have achieved this absolute reduction target this year we still consider it valid as variations in work load and type of work undertaken can cause both positive and negative changes to our absolute emissions.  In 2019, we achieved circa 21.2% absolute reduction from the baseline period.   Our long term target is to be a carbon positive business, and in line with the UK target, we aim to produce ''net zero"" greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and ""Net Positive"" by 2050. This includes all scope 1, scope 2 and mandated scope 3 elements of our UK business."
"Graphic Packaging reported this target to CDP in 2018 and is reporting progress against the same target in 2020. The 2020 increase in Graphic Packaging's scope 1 + 2 emissions caused the total emissions to exceed the baseline, and as such 0% of the target is currently achieved."
"The Duratex absolute target established is: ''Reduce 25% of Duratex's direct emissions (Scope 1)” in relation to the base year (2012). It was developed in 2016, based on a review of Duratex's material themes that resulted in the company's Sustainability Strategy, to be started in 2017. This target covers Duratex's operations in Brazil, excluding the Ceramic Coatings business. In 2012, Duratex's participation in the capital of Tablemac (currently Duratex Colombia) went from 25% to 37%, and its emissions have not yet been accounted for, so the percentage of Scope emissions was 100% in the base year. In 2020, the operations contemplated in the target would represent 95.58% of direct emissions.Currently, the Strategy and its targets are under review, with the aim of establishing a science-based emission target. Considering the projections made at the time the milestones were drawn up, the emissions from Duratex's Brazilian operations in 2020, which include the Deca (Metals and Ceramics), Hydra and Wood (Forest and Panels) divisions, and being accounted for for the first time, Ceramic Coating , totaled 270,958.25 tCO2e, above the expected milestone for 2020 (203,218.69 tCO2e). The increase in the company's absolute emissions of approximately 9% was due to acquisitions and expansions in the Ceramic Coatings area. The expected evolution to reach the goal in 2025 was not linear, since variable production projections were considered. It is important to highlight that Duratex is revisiting its emissions targets, including for the Colombia and Ceramic Coating units. The expectation is to disclose the goals with a scientific basis in 2021, together with the Company's new Sustainability Strategy.  The goals are to reduce emissions and maintain a positive carbon balance within the business."
"This covers all our sites globally, and we intend both Scope 1, and Scope 2 (market and location) to contribute to progress."
"Scope:This target encompasses all Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions produced by Lowe's and our subsidiaries.Reason for revision:Lowe's original target for 2030 was a 40% absolute reduction from our 2016 baseline emissions. We have revised this and have created a more aggressive target to further Lowe's commitment to fighting climate change and reducing our carbon emissions.Alignment with 1.5°C:• To align with 1.5 degrees, you need to have a 4.2% reduction rate per year for absolute reduction targets• We are committing to a 60% reduction (~4.3% YOY reduction), so we align with 1.5 degrees"
"Reduce our Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions by 25% by the end of 2022.Based on our performance in 2020 we are on target to achieve this reduction, specific objectives and activities are in place at our operational sites to help achieve this reduction."
Compared to  base year FY18 the overall emissions from purchased electricity decreased in FY21. This was due to the fact that 157.6 million units of power was procured in FY21 was from renewable sources compared to 66 million units from renewable sources in FY18. We have achieved  very successfully more than target of 10% scope 2 emission reduction  from base year FY18 by reducing emissions by  50 % in FY21 compared to base year FY18.
"This target is for net zero scope 3 category 2(new construction) GHG emissions by 2030.  This follows the UK GBC guidance and definitions of net zero carbon, taking account of actual reductions in embodied carbon of new constructions through design optimisation, material selection, waste reduction, construction site impact reduction, and finally offsetting using certified carbon offsets for any residual carbon emissions in order to achieve net zero GHG emissions.  Note that to avoid double-counting of emissions, embodied carbon for the purposes of this target relates to ""cradle to PC + end of life"" (RIBA stages A1-A5 and C1-C4), and excludes operational emissions (RIBA stages B1-B7) as these are already captured within our Scope 1+2 target (as under our all-inclusive billing model, all tenant energy use is part of Unite Students overall scope 1+2 GHG emissions)."
"In its corporate responsibility programme Apetit has set a target to reduce its climate impats. Apetit will reduce its direct CO2 emissions by 75% by transitioning to energy solutions based on renewable resources and by improving energy efficiency. The reduction of emissions in 2020 was mainly caused by Apetit switching to electricity generated by wind power in all of its production sites. Apetit updated its corporate responsibility programme and the targets in early 2021, as continuation to the earlier targets set in 2019. Making the initial emission targets in 2019 in its earlier responsibility programme, Apetit had emission reduction targets only set by intensity. The absolute reduction target was added in the update.In 2020, over 95 per cent of Apetit's Scope 1&2 emissions are covered by Scope 2 emissions.  Apetit will include Scope 3 emissions in its climate impact calculations in 2022."
"The target and emission data covers the KION Group and its consolidated subsidiaries.A comprehensive climate strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in line with the 2°C target or higher ambition levels is currently being developed.Base year emissions updated corresponding to regular update of conversion and emission factors.Given the extraordinary global situation in the reporting year and the strong influence on environmental data in particular, a correct interpretation of changes compared to the previous year is only possible in individual cases."
"Target We have net zero scope 1 emissions since 2015 (with offsetting taken into account). From 2030 and further we intend to have zero scope 1 emissions without offsetting. Currently we compensate with Gold Standard certificates. So as from 2030 our gross scope 1 emissions will be zero. This will be accomplished by: 1) As from 2025 only inflow of new cars which have zero emission; 2) migrate to bio-fuels and bio-based cooling fluids. or electric cars This target is approved by SBTi on 13th February 2017. The SBTi technical team and the SBTi Steering Committee have approved the submitted target on reduction of gross scope 1 emissions. This target is part of our approved science based target to have zero gross Scope1 emissions and zero scope 2 market based emissions as from 2030. Cars are responsible for ~70% of our Scope1 emissions. Depending on the developments in the car-sector our cars will be using bio-gas, electricity or hydro-power. To stay on track we have short term targets for 2021 on car fuel consumption (70% compared to baseyear). Baseline and targets are disclosed in our annual report appendix 7 Environmental Figures: https://jaarverslag2020.kpn/ on page 213, Table 3.Result 2020In 2020 our gross scope 1 emissions were  16,781 tons. % of target achieved 2020 is 71.5% ((16,781/58,830)-1). In 2020, our absolute savings on car fuel compared to 2010 was 73% In 2020, we saved more than double the amount of used fuel compared to 2019, due to COVID-19 travel and commuting restrictions. In 2020, we added 158 electric cars and 107 biogas cars as part of our fleet transformation, which equates to an inflow of 46% fossil fuel free cars (lease and engineers). This is higher than our 2020 target of 35%.In 2019 our gross scope 1 emissions were 26,343 tons, % target achieved 2019 was 55%. Coverage: As result of our materiality-assessment 98% of our scope1 CO?e emissions are in scope. This is also mentioned  in Annual Report 2020 Appendix 7  page 213 header."
"Base year is changed to FY 2020-21. This is done since our scope of reporting has increased and become more accurate and reliable. Internet Data Centres have been included and the emissions due to the increased site count has been incorporated. As a responsible organization we intend to achieve net zero for our complete scope of reporting, hence have consider FY 2020-21 as our base year.

"This target covers facilities and vehicles in our scope 1 and 2 footprint. In our owned or operated facilities, we aim to use 100% renewable electricity by the end of FY25 as part of our effort to control absolute emissions. These goals are aligned with the level of mitigation needed to limit average global temperature to a rise of no more than 2°C above the pre-Industrial Revolution average. Linear progress is not expected on this target. Nike committed to SBTs in 2017 and set the scope 1 and 2 SBT in 2019. NIKE will start disclosing performance on its scope 3 target in the FY21 Nike Impact Report."
"In 2019, we reached our goal of becoming carbon neutral for Scope 1 and 2 emissions, one year ahead of our plan. To reach this goal, we started by reducing our location-based emissions by 60% since 2010. Second, we have focused on purchasing renewable electricity in a way that supports new solar and wind. This is being done through installing onsite solar and long-term agreements for new utility and small scale solar and wind projects in the U.S. Finally, for unavoidable emissions we purchased high quality, certified carbon offsets in each region in which we operate."

"Our Scope 1 + 2 GHG emissions target for 2035 covers 100% of our gross global Scope 1 + 2 emissions considering 2018 as the base year. Commencement of the target began as of the starting of 2020 financial year. Strategic pillars & sources for achieving our 2035 target are:• Energy efficiency targets & their applications (Energy efficiency in our HQ and branches (LED Lighting transformation, HVAC transformation, Implementation of Building Energy Management System).• Renewable energy installments for our self electricity consumption.• Procurement of renewable electricity.• Digital banking & digitalization of our banking services and its implications on the decrease of our branch quantity and cumulative energy demand.• Carbon emissions offseting for the remaining portion of our emissions between 2030 and 2035.Considering the cumulative impact of the strategic pillars & sources mentioned above, we aim to be a ""Carbon Neutral Bank"" with a 100% scope 1 + 2 emissions reduction target for 2035. This 100% reduction in our gross global Scope 1 + 2 emissions will be a cumulative result of the benefits of our energy efficiency initiatives, renewable energy installments, digitalization of banking services, our procurement of renewable electricity and carbon offseting efforts. Following the actualization of our 2025 and 2030 targets, remaining portion of Scope 1 + 2 emissions will be offseted. We consider this a science-based target, but this target has not been approved as science-based by the Science-Based Targets initiative. We will follow the appropriate pathway for this target to be approved by SBTi."
"In both 2019 and 2020 the Group had purchased Renewable Energy Certificates to cover electricity and cooling across all Group units, but in summer 2020 Jyske Bank purchased a wind turbine at the Port of Hirtshals. Initially the wind turbine was purchased to offset CO2 emissions from electricity consumption via our own production of renewable energy. Jyske Bank is now taking the next step, with a new target for CO2 emissions relating to heating and company cars to be covered by our own production of renewable energy.By the end of 2022 we will offset our CO2 emissions from electricity, heating and driving the bank's vehicles with our own production of renewable energy.Further information on targets can be found in Jyske Bank's Sustainability Report 2020: https://investor.jyskebank.com/wps/wcm/connect/jbc/fe6b1ee5-e980-42fa-aadb-6ac2c5efdcb4/Sustainability+Report+2020+%281%29.pdf?MOD=AJPERES&CVID=nzZZumr"

"Target coverage : 100% of Colas' Scope 3a (upstream)  emissions which represents 75% of the Group's Scope 1&2 emissions in 2019.Each business has established its climate roadmap using two scenarios, the focal points of which have varied from one business to another depending on their activities. These scenarios are based on the work of the IEA (International Energy Agency) and were carried out with the Carbone 4 firm.- Two types of 1.5 ° C scenarios leading to a low-carbon society have been developed:o The first so-called ""Pro-techno"" scenario estimates that the socio-environmental transition is based mainly on technological innovation which makes it possible to maintain GDP growth while significantly reducing environmental impacts (decoupling).o The second scenario called ''Sobriety” considers that the socio-environmental transition is based on resilience and societal changes by adopting new objectives of prosperity and social growth.- The scenario analysis exercise then consisted in projecting the current activities of each Business Line in these low-carbon transformation scenarios and identifying how the transformation of the ''business playground” induced by the scenario positively affected or negatively the activities of the Trade.- The risks and opportunities were thus identified, making it possible to understand the resilience of the current strategy of each Business Line in contrasting contexts of low-carbon transformation of the economy.Reduction projections were made based on climate scenarios and trajectories to set the level of ambition of the efforts to be made by the businesses. In that respect, the scenarios were chosen based on factor 4 considering a medium-term time horizon at 2030 and a long-term time horizon at 2050 as it is in line with the climate commitments of the public and private sector, namely that it is set on a path to limit global warming to 2/1,5°C.This analysis helped to set objectives:- Colas 2030 : -30% Scope 3a, i.e. 2.7% annual reduction rate over target period, which is aligned with the well-below 2°C pathway"

"The Group's direct operational emissions refer to emissions related to energy consumption and use of chemicals (scope 1 & 2) and emissions relating to employee mobility (scope 3 – business travel). In 2019, the Group made a commitment to reduce these emissions by 20% by 2023 and 40% by 2030 in absolute value against a 2018 baseline covering 100% of Group's related emissions.Business travel :For several years, the Group has implemented a business travel policy aiming at minimizing the associated carbon footprint. Investments in communication tools (telepresence rooms, video conferencing, etc.) make it possible to limit business travel.For business travel that cannot be avoided, the Group encourages the use of more eco?friendly modes of transport such as trains and low?energy use vehicles. In this regard, short?term car rental companies are encouraged to offer hybrid or electric vehicles.In 2020, CO2 emissions related to business travel were assessed at 29 ktCO2e, i.e. a 68% drop compared with 2019 and 69% compared with 2018. This sharp decline is explained by the reduction of business travel induced by the Covid?19 pandemic.Company car policy :The policy on Company cars is determined by the Group and is implemented in each country depending on legal and taxation provisions, local practices and the energy mix. In France, which accounts for about 50% of the vehicle fleet, a range of vehicles is available for each use with the aim  of significantly reducing the associated carbon footprint, in line with the target of a 40% reduction in operational emissions by 2030. In 2020, the  roll?out of this policy resulted in a significant increase in orders for hybrid company vehicles, which now represent almost 50% of orders. Orders for electric company vehicles are encouraged, including for utilityvehicles, associated with the installation of charging stations at the sites (69 in France, or 138 charging stations) and the introduction of a roaming charging service now available for company vehicles. This trend is expected to gain strength as the fleet is renewed, with additional demand for various ranges of electric vehicles."
"Essity´s Scope 3 target was approved by the SBTi in December 2018. Scope 3 categories included in this target are purchased goods and services (cat. 1), upstream transportation (cat 3), downstream transportation (cat 9), waste generated in operations (cat 5) and end-of-life treatment of sold products(cat 12). These 5 categories cover 94% of the Scope 3 emissions."
"Even though SBTi is not applied to setting the group's emission target, Hana Financial Group voluntarily established a carbon neutrality plan with an annual emission reduction target of 2.8 % until 2050 which is more stringent than the target of 2.5 % recommended by SBTi. The mid-term target in 2030 is closely linked with the long-term target in 2050."
"As per Abs 1, using FY18 as our baseline year, we set science-based absolute emissions reduction targets for Group Scope 1 & 2 emissions with absolute targets including a 20% reduction by 2020, 43% reduction by 2025, 71% reduction by 2030 and a 95% reduction by 2050. Progress towards these science-based absolute emissions reduction targets can be found on our Climate-related disclosure, page 22: https://www.iag.com.au/sites/default/files/Documents/Safer%20Communities/FY20-Climate-related-disclosure.pdf"
"We developed approved science based targets for Scope 1, 2 and 3 by rather than starting from where we are, we looked at where we believed we should be in 2030 and beyond, and then worked back to see what that would mean for what we must achieve by 2025 and then 2030.   To make our carbon footprint targets more meaningful, they are based on absolute rather than intensity reduction.   Tate & Lyle committed  to reduce absolute scope 3 GHG emissions 15%  GHG emissions  by 2030 from a 2019 base year.  Tate & Lyle reports >98% of its Scope 3 emissions. Gensuite, a web-based commercially available solution, is the system of record for EHS process  EH&S process data, excluding Scope 3 emissions,  is audited pursuant to internal procedure where internal EH&S professionals review measured data on a regular basis. All publicly reported EH&S data is audited by Tate & Lyle's internal audit team and third-party auditors annually. It was verified by AECOM (https://www.tateandlyle.com/sites/default/files/2021-06/independent-verification-opinion-environmental-process-data-aecom-2021.pdf).  The 2019 baseline and 2020 Scope 3 results were calculated with support from AECOM.Data reported prior to 2019 includes the JV facility where Tate & Lyle doesn't have operational control.  2019 baseline & 2030 target progress report Tate & Lyle-owned & JV manufacturing facilities where T&L has operational control.  Per the EHS Reporting Criteria, environmental data is included in the external reporting scope after data has been measured for one full calendar year of operation under our ownership / control (https://www.tateandlyle.com/sites/default/files/2021-06/ehs-reporting-criteria-2021-annual-report.pdf)."
"Under the banner of ''Plant CO2 Zero Challenge” as declared in the Toyota Environmental Challenge 2050, we aim to achieve zero CO2 emissions from vehicles manufacturing at the global consolidated production plants. In order to achieve this goal, Toyota will strive to ""introduce innovative technologies"" and ""introduce renewable energy and use hydrogen.""First, by simplifying and streamlining the manufacturing process steps, we shorten the process and time, and improve energy efficiency by optimizing the equipment and facilities and making good use of waste heat. In addition, we will reduce CO2 emissions by all means, including introduction of energy-free ""Karakuri (ingenious mechanical system)."" In addition, we will effectively use solar, wind and other renewable energies and hydrogen energy, working together with our stakeholders to promote construction of social systems that are required to enhance supply and use of such energy sources."
"The Chugai Group has set Mid-term environmental goals, set final years, and contributed to the realization of a sustainable global environment for the three important issues of climate change countermeasures, the use of renewable and recycled resources, and biodiversity conservation.  In addition, we have set long-term targets for GHG reduction with 2050 as the final year."
"The year 2020 changed the way our employees work and commute to work. Distant working (""home office"")  has become the norm, which has led to a large reduction in GHG emissions in the relevant category. We want to partially preserve this way of working in the future. As part of the our ""home office"" program, we enable our employees to work 4 days a month from home based on line manager approval, up to 8 days based on Divisional leader approval and more than 8 days per month based on Management board approval. This home office policy is applicable for 2021 and will be updated by the end of 2021 again."
"The Covid-19 pandemic resulted in an exponential and unanticipated increase in demand for core products lines, e.g. sanitiser, disinfectants and PPE. Business revenue increased by 20%, and the resulting increases to distribution, importing (as a result of global supply chain challenges), storage and goods transportation meant carbon emissions increased beyond business growth forecasts, e.g. the predicted reduction was not achieved. However,  Arrow are on-track to achieve their revised 2021 target, in line with industry and government guidance."
"This is applicable to the Scope 2 emissions (location-based) of all our operations. The target is a reduction of 8% by 2025. Baselines were determined by analysing data over the period 2017 to 2019.Although we achieved the target in 2020, the absolute target that needs to be achieved by 2025 is still being pursued. We acknowledge that some of the reduction in electricity consumption in 2020 was because of the impact of COVID-19 on operational activities and not only energy efficiency initiatives. As such, we will continue to implement energy efficiency projects to ensure that the target is realised in 2025.The target is not a science-based target. However, we will consider science-based targeting as we look to setting targets for 2030."
"As part of the company's carbon neutral commitment, BNY Mellon plans to procure renewable energy for all Scope 2 electricity. In 2014, emissions from electricity made up 92% of the company's total Scope 1 and 2 market-based emissions; therefore procuring solely renewable electricity would represent a 92% reduction in emissions compared to 2014 when no renewable electricity was purchased.In 2015 and 2016, BNY Mellon purchased 290,000 MWh of Green-e Certified Renewable Energy Credits (RECs), 31,000 MWh of Guarantees of Origin (GO) and 45,000 MWh of PowerPlus Green Power to match the company's entire Scope 2 electricity use. In 2017, the company purchased 257,000 MWh of RECs, 34,000 MWh of GOs, 5,899 MWh of International Renewable Electricity Credits (I-RECs) and 35,919 MWh of PowerPlus Instruments to match BNY Mellon's entire Scope 2 electricity use. In 2018, BNY Mellon purchased 264,000 MWh of RECs, 28,500 MWh of Renewable Energy Guarantees of Origin (REGOs), 3,779 MWh of I-RECs, and 39,863 MWh of PowerPlus Instruments to match the company's entire Scope 2 electricity use. In 2019, BNY Mellon purchased 268,000 MWh of RECs, 28,185 MWh of Renewable Energy Guarantees of Origin (REGOs), 5,593 MWh of I-RECs, and 36,972 MWh of PowerPlus Instruments to match the company's entire Scope 2 electricity use. In 2020, BNY Mellon purchased 230,000 MWh of RECs, 13,061 MWh of Renewable Energy Guarantees of Origin (REGOs), 9,000 MWh of Guarantees of Origin (GOs), and 29,800 MWh of I-RECs to nearly match the company's entire Scope 2 electricity use. A small remainder (0.5%) remains in markets in which renewable energy is difficult to purchase- carbon offsets are used in those locations to cover the remaining balance, however, that is not reflected in our market based emissions here."
"Statkraft commits to a power sector pathway compatible with a 1.5°C global warming target. Though Statkraft's carbon intensity is among the lowest in the European energy sector, we are continuously working to reduce our own emissions (scope 1 + market based scope 2) to reach carbon neutrality in 2040.  We aim to achieve this through decarbonisation of both our electricity generation and our district heating business, while we will continue to consume 100% certified renewable energy. We will also work with our suppliers to ensure emissions reductions in our scope 3 emissions.  All our future investment will be renewable and our business will thrive in a world committed to reaching the Paris agreement's urgent targets. Statkraft's contribution to lower emissions through renewable energy is already substantial, and the company's own emissions will be carbon neutral by 2040."
Replacement of all fossil-fuel heating systems in owned real estate at end of life. No direct CO2e emissions by 2040.  This target will be enhanced by the targets in NZ1 and NZ2.
"The supply of pre-conditioned air for the airlines should reduce the emissions of APU (auxiliary power units). Base year was 2015, the last year without use of PCA (pre-conditioned air). For 2016 the target was a reduction of 3800 t (or 9%) and the reduction target for 2017 was 9500 t (or 22.5%).  For 2018 the reduction target was 14650 t CO2. The target in 2019 of 15.200 t CO2  was overbid by a total reduction of 20851 t CO2. In 2020, the target of 19.000 could not be achieved because of the corona crisis."
"Stated on 2020 CSR Report, page 131~132:CDF began unaudited inventorying and reporting carbon emissions from employees' business travels by public transportation in 2015, including aircraft, Taiwan High Speed Rail (THSR), Taiwan Railways, and taxis. Estimated carbon emissions from business travel are calculated based on the amount of carbon emissions generated by each type of transportation (carbon emissions from aircraft were calculated based on the United Nations International Civil Aviation Organization's Carbon Emissions Calculator with data from the same year provided on its website; those from highspeed rail were calculated based on 2017 carbon footprint data provided on THSR's website; and those from railway and taxi were calculated based on the Industrial Technology Research Institute's carbon footprint calculation platform with 2014 and 2015 data) and the number of miles traveled. In 2015 and 2016, the scope included only employees of CDF and CDIB Capital Group, expanded in 2017 to include those of KGI Bank and KGI Securities, and in 2019 to China Life Insurance. The scope of data in 2020 covered CDF and all of its subsidiaries. The coverage rate was 97.8% based on the number of employees. CDF conducts annual greenhouse gas inventory and independent inspections of Scope 3 employee business travel, photocopying paper, waste incineration and mail delivery, and sets carbon reduction targets to evaluate the progress of financial control in reducing global warming. In response to the low-carbon transition, on Apr. 2021, CDF commits to set a goal of achieving net zero carbon emissions from its own operations by 2030 with the base period of 2019, including Scope 1, 2 and business travel, and will develop implementation roadmap for net zero carbon emissions within 18 months. From 2023 to 2029, CDF will continue to monitor and revise the implementation path to achieve 2030 goal. In 2019, carbon emissions of business travel were 478.1 metric tons, with a coverage rate of 96.3%. In 2020, carbon emissions of business travel were 194.42 metric tons, and its coverage rate was 97.8%. Due to COVID-19 and less business travel, the carbon emission reduced drastically by 283.68 metric tons of CO2e in 2020 compared to 2019, which has achieved 59.3% of the net zero carbon emission target in 2030."
This is a long-term science-based target and covers 100% of scope 3 emissions.
"The company has set a 3% reduction target on absolute energy consumption in comparison to 2019. We had an absolute reduction of over 13% on absolute electricity consumption, representing an absolute 13,39% scope 2 emissions reduction.We are evaluating the possibility of setting science based targets in the near future."

"Reducing GHG emissions at our operated assets is a key component of our climate change strategy. We have set public GHG emissions reduction targets since the 1990s and regularly review them as our strategy and circumstances change.  This current five-year target, which took effect from 1 July 2017, is to maintain our total operational emissions in FY2022 at or below FY2017 levels (16.3 million tonnes CO2e, as adjusted), while we continue to grow our business. The FY2017 baseline will be adjusted for any material acquisitions and divestments based on GHG emissions at the time of the transaction and carbon offsets will be used as required.  This target covers all Scope 1 and 2 emissions based on an operational control approach in line with World Resources Institute/World Business Council for Sustainable Development guidance.The FY2017 baseline emissions provided in this CDP disclosure represents total reported emissions from both Continuing and Discontinued operations as at 30 June 2020 (please see Annual Report 2020 for details on Discontinued operations). On this basis we are meeting our target by a margin of approximately 3%. We also calculate an adjusted baseline excluding material divestments - this detail is available in our Annual Report 2020 and Climate Change Report 2020.  Our operated asset-level emissions forecasts indicate we are on track to meet our FY2022 target on this basis also, due primarily to implementation of renewable energy contracts in Chile in FY2022. More recent information on progress against this and our other targets will be available in our 2021 reporting suite (including the Annual Report), which will be available at bhp.com."
"In 2020 reporting year, we successfully reduced our scope 2 CO2 emissions by 97% due to the Mainland Green Utilities contract which started in October 2019, and the NI Green Utilities contract negotiated in October 2020 securing further reduction."
iwis has set a target and has self-assessed it to be science-based but has not had it approved by the SBTi (the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi)).since 2018 iwis used only CO2 neutral natural gas
"In year 2016 Acea started elaborating a new strategy concerning a portion of the electricity consumed: main companies could certify the electricity consumed in the year as ''G.O.” (a garanzia d'origine=certificates of guarantees of origin). In 2017, 2018 and 2019  main companies already managed to use such certificates, that confirm the electricity origins from renewable sources, buying these certificates from Acea Energia. In year 2020, again main Companies consumed G.O. electricity: the Company Acea Energia sold G.O. energy to the main companies of the Group, meeting the target for the fourth year."
"We've made strong progress over the last decade, reducing Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions across our entire value chain by 37.7% between 2010-2019. However, much more needs to be done. That is why we updated our climate strategy in December 2020, including an ambition to reach net zero GHG emissions by 2040 and a target to reduce our absolute GHG emissions across our value chain by 30% by 2030 (versus 2019). Within that target, we committed to reduce absolute scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions 47% by 2030 from a 2019 base year and reduce absolute scope 3 GHG emissions 29% by 2030 from a 2019 base year. Our GHG reduction target has been approved by the SBTi as being in line with a 1.5?C reduction pathway, as recommended by the IPCC. Based upon the boundary scope of our absolute target, we have achieved a 11,9% absolute reduction in carbon emissions from a 2019 baseline. This represents 40% completion so far."
"In 2016, KBC decided to stop direct financing of coal-related activities and committed to exit such financing in the Czech Republic by 2050 at the latest (exposure ad. EUR 252 mln in 2016). After an intermediate tightening of the energy policy in 2018, KBC committed in 2020 to a full exit from all direct coal-related financing by end 2021 (EUR 11 mln remaining in 2020). We have translated this target on direct coal-related exposure in an absolute emission target for this business activity (= target coverage) (ABS 8) for the purpose of this question based upon the following method: estimated GHG emissions associated with the direct financing were calculated based on following sources (in order of appearance these sources provide high to lower quality GHG emissions): 1) EU ETS registry with 2016 verified GHG emissions (10% of exposure)2) coal production (in tons) and coal-fired power plants (in MW) information from the PACTA physical asset dataset of 4Q19 (5%)3) 2018 coal production (in tons) information from the European Association for Coal and Lignite (84%). For non-EU ETS derived GHG emission data, physical units were converted to associated CO2 emissions as follows: -For coal mining the coal production associated estimated CO2 emissions obtained based on the GEM 4 factor formula containing several assumptions and proxies (https://www.gem.wiki/Estimating_carbon_dioxide_emissions_from_coal_mines)-For power companies the installed capacity associated estimated CO2 emissions obtained based on the GEM 4 factor formula containing several assumptions and proxies (https://www.gem.wiki/Estimating_carbon_dioxide_emissions_from_coal_plants)As a final step we calculated our share in company emissions on a loan-weighted average basis: estimated emissions company*granted exposure company/total coal-related granted exposure.100% coverage as we only calculated GHG emissions from financing direct coal-related activities in the base year. Please note that given the limited remaining exposure at year-end 2020 ad. EUR 11 mln and negligible related GHG emissions, while exposure will further reduce to zero in 2021, we do not report these emissions in question C-FS14.1a (includes GHG from mortgage & car loans only).Given the steep average annual reduction (24.9% (= 99.6%/(2020-2016)) & ultimate prospect of 0 in 2021 we consider this aligned with a 1.5?C scenario."
"Years are all fiscal.  Base year is FY2015, start year is FY2016 and target year is FY2020.Sony is implementing its environmental actions based on our environmental plan ""Road to Zero"" announced in April 2010. The plan, which includes a long-term goal of achieving a zero environmental footprint by 2050, uses back casting methods to set specific mid-term environmental targets for the next five years in line with that goal. Targets are based on four environmental perspectives that includes climate change across all product lifecycle stages.  We eliminate or minimize risks and seize or maximize opportunities by taking actions according to this plan.Sony announced the establishment of its ""Green Management 2020"" group environmental medium-term targets that took effect from FY2016 through 2020 in 2015, and introduced them. Climate change targets included in the ""Green Management 2020"" were approved by SBT in 2015.Sony will also continue to participate in the WWF's Climate Savers Programme, which aims to achieve reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, from fiscal 2016 onwards. Climate change targets are verified by WWF and a third-party verification body for their degrees of difficulty and progress.Comparing FY2020 with the base year (FY2015), the emissions (in Scope1+2) is reduced by approximately 170,296 metric tons CO2e which is equal to approximately 10.89% reduction in total. Sony has achieved its GM2020 goal in climate change."
"iwis has set a target and has self-assessed it to be science-based, but has not had it approved by the SBTi (the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi)).This target include using 2 E-Auto for employee commuting"
"We have set a company-wide (i.e. Group) absolute reduction target for Scope 1. As it corresponds to the use of fuels and natural gas which are not directly part of the production process, we do not apply intensity indicators. In this case, these sources are used for our facilities, e.g. heating purpose. The target is underway thanks to the energy-efficient projects in each plant, such as HVAC equipment, replacement of heating pumps and automatic controls of heating pumps. Our ambition to reduce our absolute consumption of natural gas and fuels is accompanied by a transition to a low-carbon model. This goal is described in ""Other climate-related goals"" further in this section. It goes hand-in-hand with the reported absolute target to not only minimize our energy consumption, but also ensure renewable sources for all energy types across all locations by 2030.Within our global target of 30% reduction by the end of the year 2023, we have reached a 28% reduction in 2020, therefore we are well on the way to reach our target."
"This item reports the Scope 1+2 of vendors who have signed a Carbon Partnership with Coway. Coway strives to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions of vendors who participate in Coway's Carbon Partnership. The report is based on 17 vendors who participated in the scheme in 2019. This section reports on the performance of 17 vendors who agreed to Coway's Carbon Partnership. Compared to the base year 2010, the absolute amount decreased by 5,932 tCO2e, or 15.92%, in 2020"
All company-wide Scope 1 emissions (direct emissions) were taken into account. This target was defined in 2016 in line with the targets agreed as part of the EnAW (Swiss Business Energy Agency) participation.
"Although the 2020 target was achieved, the majority of this reduction was due to COVID-19 related impacts such as remote work and facility shutdowns, and reduced production."
